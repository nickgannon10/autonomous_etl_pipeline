The Special Meeting
The Virtual Special Meeting (see page 28)
The special meeting of CorePoint stockholders (the “special meeting”) is scheduled to be held virtually on March 1, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time.
Due to the continuing public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the health and well-being of our stockholders and other
participants at the special meeting, the special meeting will be a virtual meeting of stockholders. You will be able to attend the special meeting and
vote your shares electronically by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPLG2022SM. You must have your sixteen-digit control number that
is shown on your notice of electronic availability of proxy materials or your proxy card if you receive your proxy materials by mail. You will not be
able to attend the meeting in person.
Purpose of the Special Meeting (see page 28)
At the special meeting, CorePoint stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 
 
•
 to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the “merger proposal”);
 
 
•
 to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by CorePoint to its named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal”); and
 
 
•
 to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting
additional votes for the approval of the merger proposal if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the
special meeting or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to CorePoint
stockholders (the “adjournment proposal”).
The Board unanimously has determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the
best interest of CorePoint and its stockholders, approved and adopted the merger agreement, and declared advisable, approved and authorized the
entry into the merger agreement, the merger and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board
unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. 
CorePoint stockholders must vote to approve the merger proposal as a condition for the merger to occur. If CorePoint stockholders fail to approve
the merger proposal by the requisite vote, the merger will not occur.
Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote (see page 29)
Only holders of CorePoint common stock at the close of business on January 14, 2022, the record date for the special meeting (the “record date”),
will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any
 
2
Table of Contents
adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 59,136,507 shares of CorePoint common stock
were issued and outstanding.
Holders of CorePoint common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of CorePoint common stock they own at the close of business on the
record date. The vote of the holders of CorePoint’s Cumulative Redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, which we refer to as
the “CorePoint preferred stock,” is not required to approve any of the proposals at the special meeting.
Quorum (see page 29)
The presence at the virtual meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast as of the
close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Actual attendance at the virtual meeting is not required in order to be counted for
purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be
represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject CorePoint to additional
expense. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the special meeting.
Required Vote (see page 29)
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of CorePoint common
stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
proposal.
Approval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on the proposal.
As of January 14, 2022, the directors and executive officers of CorePoint either directly or through their affiliates, collectively, beneficially owned and
were entitled to vote 2,490,944 shares of CorePoint common stock, representing approximately 4.2% of the shares of CorePoint common stock
outstanding on that date. CorePoint currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of CorePoint common stock in
favor of the foregoing proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so. In addition, concurrently with the
execution of the merger agreement, certain of our stockholders (the “Blackstone parties”) who collectively own 17,586,538 shares of CorePoint
common stock, or approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock, entered into a support agreement with Cavalier
pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, to vote their shares in favor of the merger proposal. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Support Agreement” beginning on page 101 for more information on the support agreement.
Attendance and Voting at the Special Meeting (see page 30)
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a “stockholder of record” and you may vote your
shares virtually at the special meeting or by submitting a proxy by mail, over the internet or by telephone. If you plan to attend the virtual special
meeting, you will be able to vote your shares electronically. Although CorePoint offers four different methods for shares to be voted at the special
meeting, CorePoint encourages you to submit a proxy over the internet or by telephone, as CorePoint believes they are the most convenient, cost-
effective and reliable methods of causing your shares to be voted. If you choose to submit a proxy over the internet or by telephone, there is no
need for you to mail back your proxy card.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and you will
receive a vote instruction form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted.

Table of Contents
CorePoint recommends that you submit a proxy or submit your voting instructions as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the
special meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting. If you return an executed proxy and do not indicate
how you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of CorePoint common stock will be voted “FOR” such proposal.
Solicitation of Proxies (see page 32)
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and CorePoint will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) has been retained
to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $40,000, plus a contingent success fee of $20,000, subject to potential
increase in certain circumstances, and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with
the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks,
and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of CorePoint common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by
Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of CorePoint’s directors, officers and employees.
Adjournments and Postponements (see page 32)
In addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, CorePoint stockholders are also being
asked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes
in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal or to ensure that
any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to CorePoint stockholders. Whether or not a quorum is
present, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time. In addition, if a quorum is present, then the
holders of a majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal may approve the adjournment proposal and adjourn the meeting. If the special
meeting is adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional votes on the merger proposal, stockholders who have already submitted
their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If you submit a proxy and do not indicate how you wish
to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.
CorePoint may postpone, recess or adjourn the special meeting (and shall postpone, recess or adjourn if requested by Cavalier, (but in such case
CorePoint shall not be required to postpone or adjourn the special meeting to a date that is later than April 28, 2022)) (i) to the extent required by law
or duty, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent CorePoint reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain
the necessary vote to approve the merger proposal, (iii) if as of the time for which the special meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of CorePoint common stock represented (either in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the special meeting or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under
applicable law or duty and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by CorePoint stockholders prior to the
special meeting.
The Merger
Structure of the Merger (see page 34)
Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with the Maryland
General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the “MGCL”, and the
 
4
Table of Contents
Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which we refer to as “DRULPA”, at the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”),
CorePoint will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Cavalier. At the effective time, each share of CorePoint common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than
shares of common stock owned by CorePoint, Cavalier or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time and not held on behalf of third parties
(“cancelled shares”) and shares of common stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CorePoint or Cavalier (other than
Merger Sub) (“converted shares”) and Restricted Stock (as defined below)) will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger
consideration. At the effective time, each share of CorePoint preferred stock will automatically be converted into a unit of a newly created series of
preferred limited partnership interests of Merger Sub with substantially identical powers, preferences, privileges, and rights as the CorePoint
preferred stock and, upon such conversion, the CorePoint preferred stock will automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist.
Merger Consideration — What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger (see page 34)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, CorePoint common stockholders will have the right to
receive, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, (i) $15.65 in cash plus (ii), if applicable, incremental cash consideration per
share in certain circumstances if CorePoint resolves prior to the closing the previously disclosed tax proceedings, which we refer to as the “IRS
Matter,” with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) related to an ongoing audit of CorePoint entities in existence prior to CorePoint’s 2018 spin-off
from La Quinta Holdings Inc., less (iii) the per share amount of any dividends paid to common stockholders between the date of the merger
agreement (November 6, 2021) and the effective time of the merger determined by CorePoint to be necessary to maintain CorePoint’s qualification for
taxation as a REIT, although CorePoint does not expect any such dividends to be paid (collectively, the “per share merger consideration”), for each
share of CorePoint common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than any cancelled shares or converted
shares or Restricted Stock). The amount of such potential additional cash consideration, if any, payable to holders of CorePoint common stock will
be determined based on the amount, if any, by which the settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued
interest with respect thereto) is less than $160 million. CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on
November 5, 2021, and has entered into a definitive agreement with the IRS on the basis of such offer on November 29, 2021, which remains subject
to the calculation by the IRS of applicable interest, as described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger—Merger Consideration—What
Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger” beginning on page 34. There can be no assurances that any additional consideration will be received by
the holders of CorePoint common stock.
Effects on CorePoint if the Merger Is Not Completed (see page 35)
If the merger proposal is not approved by CorePoint stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, CorePoint stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of CorePoint common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, CorePoint will remain a public
company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file
periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, CorePoint may be required to pay Cavalier
a termination fee of $29 million, as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 99. Under specified
circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Cavalier may be required to pay CorePoint a termination fee of $58 million, as described
under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”.
Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be consummated, it
is likely that the price of our common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock
would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Treatment of CorePoint Equity Awards (see page 35)
The merger agreement provides that outstanding equity-based awards issued under CorePoint’s equity incentive plans will be treated as set forth
below:
Stock Units. Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding share of CorePoint common stock subject to vesting restrictions (“Restricted
Stock”), restricted stock unit (other than a performance-based restricted stock unit (“PSU”)) (“RSU”) or deferred stock unit granted under the
CorePoint 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (each, a “Stock Unit”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof,
become immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Unit will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the
effective time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such Stock Unit immediately prior to
the effective time multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the
terms of any applicable Stock Unit award agreement (“dividend equivalent rights”), less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment.
PSUs. Immediately prior to the effective time, each PSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become
immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of each such PSU will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the effective
time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time,
calculated based on the greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with the terms of such PSU, and (B)
target level performance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalent rights
provided under the terms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (see page 47)
After consideration of various factors, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement were advisable and in the best interest of CorePoint and CorePoint stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted the merger agreement, (iii)
declared advisable, approved and authorized the entry into the merger agreement, the merger, and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) resolved that the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement be submitted for consideration by CorePoint common stockholders at a special meeting of CorePoint stockholders and (v) resolved to
recommend that CorePoint stockholders approve the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. A description of factors
considered by the Board in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement can be found in the section entitled “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 47.
The Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote:
 
 
•
 “FOR” the merger proposal;
 
 
•
 “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal; and
 
 
•
 “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (see page 53)
In connection with the merger, on November 6, 2021, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”), CorePoint’s financial advisor, delivered to the
Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of November 7, 2021 and
based upon and subject
 
6
Table of Contents
to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion,
the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated November 7, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with such opinion, is attached as Annex B. The summary of J.P. Morgan’s
opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion. The holders of CorePoint
common stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and
assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. J.P. Morgan did not express any opinion as to the fairness of any
consideration to be paid in connection with the merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
CorePoint, or as to the underlying decision by CorePoint to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a
fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of CorePoint common stock should vote
with respect to the approval of the merger or any other matter. For a description of the opinion that the Board received from J.P. Morgan, see the
section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC” beginning on page 53.
Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 61)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, you should be aware that CorePoint’s executive
officers and directors, and in each case including organizations of which such person is an officer or partner, have interests in the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CorePoint’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other matters, in approving the merger and deciding to recommend that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal. These
interests are described below. For purposes of the discussion below, CorePoint’s executive officers are President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith
A. Cline; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Daniel E. Swanstrom II; and Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel,
Mark M. Chloupek (together with Messrs. Cline and Swanstrom, the “named executive officers” or “NEOs”). CorePoint does not currently have any
other executive officers other than the NEOs. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 61.
These material interests are summarized below:
 
 
•
 CorePoint’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under indemnification
agreements, directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and the merger agreement.
 
 
•
 Certain of CorePoint’s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation and benefits under CorePoint’s
Executive Severance Plan (as described in the section entitled “The Merger— Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger” beginning on page 61).
 
 
•
 The merger agreement provides for the payment of a pro-rated portion of annual bonuses for fiscal year 2022 (with performance deemed
achieved at target) for all employees eligible for an annual bonus (including the named executive officers) if closing does not occur by
January 1, 2022.
 
 
•
 The merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all CorePoint equity-based awards including Restricted
Stock, RSUs, PSUs, deferred stock units, and dividend equivalent rights associated with such awards for all employees holding such
awards (including the named executive officers).

Table of Contents
Financing of the Merger (see page 66)
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consolidation, repay
or redeem any indebtedness to be repaid or redeemed by CorePoint and its subsidiaries pursuant to the merger agreement and pay all fees, costs and
expenses required to be paid by Cavalier or Merger Sub at or prior to the closing of the merger in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement), which would be approximately $1.7 billion, will be funded through a combination of the following:
 
 
•
 equity commitments by Cerberus Credit (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger”) and the
Highgate Sponsors (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger”) in an aggregate amount up to
$658,138,203, subject to increase and reduction in certain circumstances, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the respective equity commitment letters, as further described in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger—
Equity Financing” beginning on page 67; and
 
 
•
 debt financing commitments from the debt commitment parties (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the
Merger”) consisting of a mortgage and/or mezzanine loan facility in an amount up to, subject to certain limitations, $1,030,000,000,
as further described in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger —Debt Financing” beginning on page 69.
Each of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors are providing limited guaranties, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
respective limited guaranties, guaranteeing the payment and performance of Cavalier of its parent termination fee obligations and certain other
payment obligations, as further described in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger —Limited Guaranties” beginning on page
68.
The consummation of the merger is not conditioned upon Cavalier obtaining the proceeds of any financing.
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 70)
CorePoint and Cavalier have determined that the filing of notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the “HSR Act”) (or other
antitrust laws) will not be necessary to complete the merger. However, at any time before or after the merger, the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, a state attorney general or a foreign competition authority could take action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking divestiture of assets of
CorePoint, Cavalier or their respective affiliates. Private parties may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 71)
As of the date of this definitive proxy statement, three lawsuits challenging the merger have been filed against CorePoint and the Board. The first
lawsuit, captioned Wang v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00026, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on
January 3, 2022. The second lawsuit, captioned Whitfield v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00147, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York on January 6, 2022. The third lawsuit, captioned Gorrell v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00146, was filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on January 10, 2022. The complaints filed in these lawsuits allege, among other things,
that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement to be filed with the SEC in violation of Sections 14(a)
and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). CorePoint and the Board believe these lawsuits are without
merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

Table of Contents
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 71)
Your receipt of the merger consideration for your shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a taxable sale of your common stock (except in the case of certain non-U.S. stockholders noted below). Generally, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the merger consideration you receive
and your adjusted tax basis in your shares. However, under certain circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger
consideration under applicable tax laws, and we intend to withhold a portion of the merger consideration paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders (who
could be treated as having effectively connected income subject to U.S. federal income tax) to the extent required under the Foreign Investment in
Real Property Tax Act. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation.
We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you. For further discussion, see “Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71.
No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal (see page 71)
We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Under Section 3-202 of the MGCL, because our common stock was listed on the NYSE on
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, our common stockholders who object to the merger do not have
any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. In addition, holders of our common
stock may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s
shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such
rights unless our Board determines that such rights apply. Our Board has made no such determination. However, our common stockholders can vote
against the merger proposal.
Expected Timing of the Merger
We anticipate completing the merger in the first quarter of 2022. However, the merger is subject to various conditions, and it is possible that factors
outside of the control of CorePoint or Cavalier could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial
amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all
required clearances and approvals and the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the merger.
No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals (see page 82)
Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, from November 6, 2021 until the effective time or, if earlier, the valid termination of the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms, CorePoint will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to and will direct its and their respective
representatives not to:
 
 
•
 initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly assist, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or knowingly take any
action to facilitate any inquiry, proposals or offers regarding, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals” beginning on page 82);
 
 
•
 engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions with or negotiations relating to, or furnish any non-public information
to any person in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the terms of this provision prohibit such

material breach of the merger agreement is received by CorePoint, and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal would constitute a Superior Proposal, the Board may, if the Board has determined

IRS Matter (see page 92)

Matter” beginning on page 92: “IRS Matter”, “IRS Matter Closing Agreement”, “IRS Matter Incremental Per Share Consideration”, “IRS Matter

November Settlement Communications duly executed by CorePoint, and use reasonable best efforts to take any actions and do any things that may
be necessary, proper or advisable in order to obtain fully countersigned copies thereof from the IRS. The parties agree that the IRS Matter November
Settlement Communications, if duly executed by CorePoint and the IRS, constitute, collectively, an IRS Matter Qualified Closing Agreement for
purposes of the merger agreement. In the event that, prior to the closing, (i) CorePoint enters into an IRS Matter Qualified Closing Agreement or (ii)
Cavalier delivers an IRS Matter notice to CorePoint, the per share merger consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the IRS Matter

respectively. Following the execution of any IRS Matter Qualified Letter of Intent or IRS Matter Qualified Closing Agreement, CorePoint shall not
amend, modify or waive any provision of, in any manner adverse to CorePoint, or withdraw or terminate such, IRS Matter Qualified Letter of Intent or
IRS Matter Qualified Closing Agreement without the prior written consent of Cavalier (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed

Closing Agreement, in and of itself, is not a condition to the closing.

agreement (subject to Cavalier’s right to delay the closing pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement) and (B) the earliest of the following (for

CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following are brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the merger, the special meeting and the proposals being considered
at the special meeting. We urge you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all
the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger and the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained
in the annexes attached to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
 
Q.
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
 
A.
On November 6, 2021, CorePoint entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of CorePoint with and into Merger Sub, pursuant to
which Merger Sub will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cavalier. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the
solicitation by the Board of proxies from CorePoint common stockholders to vote in favor of the merger proposal and the other matters to be voted
on at the special meeting.
 
Q.
What is the proposed transaction?
 
A.
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of CorePoint by Cavalier by way of the merger of CorePoint with and into Merger Sub. If the merger
proposal is approved by CorePoint stockholders and the other conditions to the consummation of the merger contained in the merger agreement
are satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived, CorePoint will merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub will be the surviving entity in the
merger and will be privately held as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cavalier. If the merger is consummated, each share of CorePoint
common stock will automatically be cancelled and you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving entity.
 
Q.
What will I receive in the merger if it is completed?
 
A.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, you will have the right to receive, without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes, (i) $15.65 in cash plus (ii) if applicable, incremental cash consideration per share in certain circumstances if
CorePoint resolves prior to the closing the previously disclosed tax proceedings, which we refer to as the “IRS matter,” with the IRS related to an
ongoing audit of CorePoint entities in existence prior to CorePoint’s 2018 spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc., less (iii) the per share amount of
any dividends paid to common stockholders between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger determined by
CorePoint to be necessary to maintain CorePoint’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, although CorePoint does not expect any such dividends to
be paid (collectively, the “per share merger consideration”), for each share of CorePoint common stock that you own. The amount of such potential
additional cash consideration, if any, payable to holders of CorePoint common stock is determined based on the amount, if any, by which the
settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued interest with respect thereto) is less than $160 million.
CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on November 5, 2021, and has entered into a definitive agreement
with the IRS on the basis of such offer on November 29, 2021, which remains subject to the calculation by the IRS of applicable interest, as
described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger—Merger Consideration—What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger” beginning
on page 34. There can be no assurances that any additional consideration will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock. You will not
be entitled to receive shares in the surviving entity or in Cavalier. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Merger
Consideration—What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger” beginning on page 34 and the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—IRS
Matter” beginning on page 92.

Table of Contents
Q.
How are CorePoint’s directors and executives intending to vote?
 
A.
As of January 14, 2022, the directors and executive officers of CorePoint either directly or through their affiliates, collectively, beneficially owned
and were entitled to vote 2,490,944 shares of CorePoint common stock, representing approximately 4.2% of the shares of CorePoint common stock
outstanding on that date. CorePoint currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of CorePoint common stock
in favor of the merger proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them has entered into any
agreement obligating them to do so.
 
Q.
Have any stockholders agreed to approve the merger?
 
A.
In addition to CorePoint’s directors and officers, concurrently with and as a condition to Cavalier’s and Merger Sub’s execution of the merger
agreement, certain entities affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (such entities, collectively, the “Blackstone parties”), have entered into a support
agreement with Cavalier (the “support agreement”) covering shares of CorePoint common stock legally or beneficially owned by the Blackstone
parties. Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the support agreement, the Blackstone parties have agreed to vote all of the
CorePoint common stock owned by them in favor of the merger. As of November 6, 2021, the Blackstone parties owned 17,586,538 shares of
CorePoint common stock representing approximately 30% of the total issued and outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock.
 
Q.
What factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the merger agreement and recommending the approval of the merger proposal, the
named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal?
 
A.
In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and declare the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
advisable, and to recommend our stockholders approve the merger proposal, the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal
and the adjournment proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of
the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed
description of these factors, see “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 47 of this proxy
statement.
 
Q.
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
 
A.
Yes. The receipt of cash in exchange for our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of our common stock for cash
pursuant to the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other
tax laws). For further discussion, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71.
 
Q.
What other effects will the merger have on CorePoint?
 
A.
If the merger is completed, CorePoint common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and CorePoint will no
longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to CorePoint common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law,
rules and regulations. Following the completion of the merger, CorePoint common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer
have any interest in CorePoint’s future earnings or growth; each share of CorePoint common stock you hold will represent only the right to receive
the merger consideration in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
 
18
Table of Contents
Q.
When is the merger expected to be completed?
 
A.
Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders of the merger proposal, the parties to the
merger agreement expect to complete the merger in the first quarter of 2022. However, CorePoint cannot assure completion by any particular date, if
at all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of stockholder approval of the merger proposal, the exact
timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time and we cannot guarantee that the merger will be completed.
 
Q.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A.
If the merger proposal is not approved by CorePoint stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, CorePoint stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of CorePoint common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, CorePoint will remain an
independent public company and shares of CorePoint common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the
Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Cavalier a
termination fee upon the termination of $29 million, as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 99. Under
specified circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Cavalier may be required to pay us a termination fee of $58 million, as described
under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”.
 
Q.
Do any of CorePoint’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a stockholder?
 
A.
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that our executive officers and
directors, and in each case including organizations of which such person is an officer or partner, have interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these differing interests, to the extent
such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending
that the merger be approved by CorePoint common stockholders. See “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger” beginning on page 61.
 
Q.
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal?
 
A.
The SEC rules require CorePoint to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will or may be made to
CorePoint’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal
is not required to complete the merger.
 
Q.
Who is soliciting my vote?
 
A.
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and CorePoint will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of
proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $40,000, plus a contingent success fee of $20,000, subject to potential increase in certain circumstances,
and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation
initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks, or other nominees to beneficial
owners of shares of CorePoint common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies
may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional
compensation, by certain of CorePoint’s directors, officers and employees.

Q.
What do I need to do now?
 
A.
Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the attached annexes.
Whether or not you expect to attend the virtual special meeting in person, please submit a proxy (or provide instructions to your bank, broker, or
other nominee, as applicable) to vote your shares as promptly as possible to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special
meeting.
 
Q.
How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
 
A.
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc.), you are considered a
“stockholder of record” and there are four methods by which you may vote your shares or have your shares voted at the special meeting:
 
 
•
 Internet: To submit a proxy to vote over the internet, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the steps outlined on the secured website.
Please have your proxy card in hand when you access the website and follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an
electronic voting instruction form. If you submit your vote via proxy over the internet, you do not have to mail in a proxy card. If you
choose to submit your vote via proxy over the internet, you must do so prior to 10:59 p.m., Central Time, on February 28, 2022.
 
 
•
 Telephone: To submit a proxy to vote by telephone, call toll-free 1-800-690-6903. Please have your proxy card in hand when you access the
website and follow the instructions in order to submit your vote by proxy by telephone. If you submit your vote via proxy by telephone,
you do not have to mail in a proxy card. If you choose to submit your vote via proxy by telephone, you must do so prior to 10:59 p.m.,
Central Time, on February 28, 2022.
 
 
•
 Mail: To submit a proxy to vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly to the address indicated on the proxy
card in the postage-paid envelope provided.
 
 
•
 Special Meeting: You may attend the virtual special meeting and vote your shares electronically, rather than by submitting a proxy to vote
your shares by mail, over the internet or by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to submit a proxy to vote to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the
meeting and vote virtually if you have already submitted a proxy. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to
vote by submitting a proxy over the internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a
proxy card by mail. If you return your signed proxy card to us or vote by submitting your proxy by telephone or over the internet before the special
meeting, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, we will vote your shares as you direct in such proxy.
If you return an executed proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of CorePoint common
stock will be voted in favor of such proposal.
 
Q.
How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker, bank or other nominee?
 
A.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and you will
receive a vote instruction form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If you
are a beneficial owner of shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the virtual special meeting, you must
bring to the virtual special meeting a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares authorizing you to vote in person at
the virtual special meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take several days.
 
20
Table of Contents
Q.
Can I change or revoke my proxy after it has been submitted?
 
A.
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you
may change or revoke your proxy by:
 
 
•
 submitting another proxy over the internet or by telephone prior to 10:59 p.m., Central Time, on February 28, 2022;
 
 
•
 timely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Secretary;
 
 
•
 timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy; or
 
 
•
 attending the virtual special meeting and voting virtually. Simply attending the virtual special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee to change or revoke your voting instructions provided to such broker, bank or other nominee.
 
Q.
How many shares of CorePoint common stock must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?
 
A.
The presence at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of CorePoint common
stock issued and outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for
business to be conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the
special meeting to another place, date or time. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting and may subject CorePoint to additional expense. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
59,136,507 shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding. Accordingly, 29,568,254 shares of CorePoint common stock must be present or
represented by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum. If you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the internet
or by telephone, or submit a ballot virtually at the special meeting (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares of
CorePoint common stock will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
 
Q.
What if I abstain from voting on any proposal? What if I do not vote?
 
A.
For the merger proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger
proposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is
based on the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding on the record date. As a result, if you abstain, or if you fail to vote (or
submit voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, in the case of “street name” shares), it will have the same effect as if you vote
“AGAINST” the approval of the merger proposal.
For the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN.” Each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires for its approval the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on the matter. Abstentions do not count as a “vote cast” under Maryland law.
As a result, assuming a quorum is present, abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee on how to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock will result in such shares not being counted for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum and will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal or the
adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents
Q.
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone or over the internet or in person at the virtual special
meeting?
 
A.
If you are a stockholder of record and you do not attend the virtual special meeting or sign and return your proxy card, vote by submitting your
proxy by telephone or vote by submitting your proxy over the internet, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted
as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. The failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares at the special
meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding as of the close
of business on the record date. As a result, if you fail to return your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
 
Q.
What is a broker non-vote? If I hold my shares in “street name,” will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my shares for me on the proposals
to be considered at the special meeting?
 
A.
Broker non-votes involve shares held in “street name” by brokers, banks and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the special
meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a
particular proposal and such broker, bank or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Under NYSE rules, brokers,
banks and other nominees holding shares in “street name” do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals
described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, if a beneficial owner of shares of CorePoint common stock held in “street name” does not give
voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the three proposals, then those shares will not be counted as
present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting (including for purposes of determining a quorum). Because all three proposals are non-
discretionary matters, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes at the special meeting; however, it is possible that a broker non-vote
could occur with respect to one or more of the proposals to the extent that voting instructions are given to a broker, bank or other nominee with
respect to at least one but less than all of the proposals. Because the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of
CorePoint common stock outstanding on the record date, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee or if a broker
non-vote occurs with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. To the extent that you
fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee or a broker non-vote occurs with respect to the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals because such shares
are not votes cast.
 
Q.
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
 
A.
No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record,
any shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various
registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and
return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or
business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules
governing the account.
 
Q.
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
 
A.
If your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card.
Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies over the internet or by
telephone) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

Q.
Am I entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights under the MGCL instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares of CorePoint
common stock?
 
A.
No. You are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger under
Maryland law because the CorePoint common stock was listed on the NYSE on the record date. In addition, common stockholders may not exercise
any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection
with the merger because, as permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless our
Board determines that the rights apply. Our Board has made no such determination. For additional information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger—No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal” beginning on page 71.
 
Q.
How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of CorePoint common stock prior to the public announcement of the
merger agreement? How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of CorePoint common stock as of a recent trading date?
 
A.
The merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter)
represents a premium of approximately 42% to CorePoint’s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day prior to CorePoint’s public
announcement of its strategic alternatives process. The merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that
may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) represents a 11.9% discount to the closing price of $17.76 per share of CorePoint common stock on
November 5, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed merger. On January 13, 2022, the last practicable day
before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of CorePoint common stock on the NYSE was $15.68 per share. You are encouraged to
obtain current market quotations for CorePoint common stock.
 
Q.
What happens if I sell my shares of CorePoint common stock before the completion of the merger?
 
A.
If you transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger. In
order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of CorePoint common stock through the effective time of the merger. The
record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date the merger is anticipated to be consummated.
Accordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special
arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of
you notifies CorePoint in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is
consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock, but you will have retained your right to vote
these shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock after the record date, we
encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the internet or telephone. 
 
Q.
What is a proxy?
 
A.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to
designate a proxy to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock is called a “proxy card.”
 
Q.
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 
A.
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the internet or telephone
 
23
Table of Contents
 
process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to abstain from voting on all, some or
none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing
how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (i) “FOR” the merger proposal;
(ii) “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
 
Q.
Who will count the votes obtained at the special meeting?
 
A.
The votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting.
 
Q.
What will the holders of CorePoint Stock Units and PSUs receive in the merger?
 
A.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, as of the effective time, each outstanding CorePoint Stock Unit will become immediately vested and be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (i) the total number of shares subject to such Stock Unit,
multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the terms of any
applicable Stock Unit award agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld under applicable law.
In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, as of the effective time, each outstanding PSU will become immediately vested and be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (i) the number of shares subject to such PSU, calculated based on
the greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with the terms of such PSU, and (B) the target level
performance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the
terms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law.
 
Q.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
 
A.
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with
respect to two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering a single proxy statement to those stockholders, unless contrary instructions
have been received. This procedure reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs
for companies. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If
your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. You may
decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies of proxy materials. If you wish to opt out of this
procedure and receive a separate set of proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one, you
should contact your broker, trustee or other nominee or CorePoint at the address and telephone number below. A separate copy of these proxy
materials will be promptly delivered to any stockholder upon written request to: Secretary, CorePoint Lodging Inc., 125 E. John Carpenter Freeway,
Suite 1650, Irving, Texas 75062.
 
Q.
When will CorePoint announce the voting results of the special meeting, and where can I find the voting results?
 
A.
CorePoint intends to announce the preliminary voting results at the special meeting, and will report the final voting results of the special meeting in
a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the special meeting. All reports that CorePoint files with the SEC
are publicly available when filed.

THE SPECIAL MEETING",35,36
CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,THE SPECIAL MEETING,"THE SPECIAL MEETING
This proxy statement is being provided to CorePoint stockholders as part of a solicitation by the Board of proxies for use at the special meeting to be
held at the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.
Date, Time and Place
The special meeting of CorePoint stockholders (the “special meeting”) is scheduled to be held virtually on March 1, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time. Due to
the continuing public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the health and well-being of our stockholders and others, the special
meeting will be a virtual meeting of stockholders. You will be able to attend the virtual special meeting and vote your shares electronically by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPLG2022SM. You must have your sixteen-digit control number that is shown on your proxy card if you receive
your proxy materials by mail. You will not be able to attend the meeting in person.
Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the special meeting, CorePoint stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 
 
•
 the merger proposal, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger,” “The Merger Agreement” and “Merger Proposal
(Proposal 1)” beginning on pages 34, 72, and 102 respectively;
 
 
•
 the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, which approval shall be on a on a non-binding, advisory basis, as
further discussed under “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and “Advisory Vote on
Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal (Proposal 2)” beginning on pages 61 and 103, respectively; and
 
 
•
 the adjournment proposal, as further described under “Adjournment Proposal (Proposal 3)” beginning on page 104.
CorePoint stockholders must approve the merger proposal as a condition to the completion of the merger. If CorePoint stockholders fail to approve the
merger proposal, the merger will not occur. The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart
from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation
proposal is only advisory in nature, it will not be binding on CorePoint, Cavalier, Merger Sub or the surviving entity. Accordingly, because CorePoint is
contractually obligated to pay such merger-related compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if
the merger proposal is approved and the closing occurs, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
Recommendation of the CorePoint Board of Directors
The Board has determined that it is in the best interest of CorePoint and its stockholders and declared it advisable that CorePoint merge with and in to
Merger Sub and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A description of factors considered by the Board in reaching
its decision to approve and declare advisable the merger can be found in “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 47.
The Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the named executive officer merger-
related compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
 
28Table of Contents
The merger proposal must be approved as a condition for the merger to occur. If CorePoint stockholders fail to approve the merger proposal by the
requisite vote, the merger will not occur.
Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote
Only holders of CorePoint common stock at the close of business on January 14, 2022, the record date for the special meeting (the “record date”), will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At the close of business on the
record date, 59,136,507 shares of CorePoint common stock were issued and outstanding.
Holders of CorePoint common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of CorePoint common stock they own at the close of business on the record
date. All holders of record of CorePoint preferred stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, but may not vote at, the
special meeting.
Quorum
The presence at the virtual special meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast as of the
close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum
is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the meeting or the stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, may
adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting and may subject CorePoint to additional expense.
If you submit a properly executed proxy card or submit your proxy over the internet or by telephone, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be
counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to
instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock will result in such shares not being counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Required Vote
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock at
the close of business on the record date.
Approval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on such proposal.
Abstentions
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either virtually or by proxy, but abstains from voting by marking “ABSTAIN” on such
holder’s ballot or proxy.
Abstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger proposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding on the record
date. As a result, if you abstain, it will have the same effect as if you vote “AGAINST” the approval of the merger. 
Each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires for its approval the affirmative vote a
majority of the votes cast on the matter. Under Maryland law, abstentions are not deemed to be a “vote cast” As a result, abstentions will be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and, assuming a quorum is present, will have no impact on the outcome the named executive
officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the
proxy will be voted “FOR” (i) approval of the merger proposal, (ii) approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and (iii)
approval of the adjournment proposal.
Failure to Vote and Broker Non-Votes 
The proposal to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock.
Therefore, the failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger.
The approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on the
proposal. Consequently, the failure to vote will have no impact on the outcome of the proposal.
The proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the
special meeting on the proposal. Consequently, the failure to vote will have no impact on the outcome of the proposal.
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other
nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular
proposal, but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Under NYSE rules, brokers, banks and other nominees holding shares
in “street name” do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, if a
beneficial owner of shares of CorePoint common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with
respect to at least one of the three proposals, then those shares will not be counted as present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting (including for
purposes of determining a quorum). Because all three proposals are non-discretionary matters, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes at
the special meeting; however, it is possible that a broker non-vote could occur with respect to one or more of the proposals to the extent that voting
instructions are given to a broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one but less than all of the proposals. Because the proposal to approve
the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust
or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger. Because the approval of
each of (i) the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and (ii) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or
appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does
not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will
have no effect on approval of each such proposal.
Voting by CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of CorePoint and their affiliates were entitled to vote 2,490,944 shares of
CorePoint common stock, or approximately 4.2% of the shares of CorePoint common stock issued and outstanding on that date. CorePoint currently
expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of CorePoint common stock in favor of the merger proposal and the other
proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so.
Attendance and Voting at the Special Meeting
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc.), you are considered a

Solicitation of Proxies
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and CorePoint will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) has been retained to
assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $40,000, plus a contingent success fee of $20,000, subject to potential increase
in certain circumstances, and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with the special
meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks, and other
nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of CorePoint common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional
compensation, by certain of CorePoint’s directors, officers and employees.
Adjournments and Postponements
In addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, CorePoint stockholders are also being asked to
approve the adjournment proposal, which will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of the
merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal or to ensure that any supplement or
amendment to this proxy statement is timely provided to CorePoint stockholders. Whether or not a quorum is present, the chairperson of the meeting may
adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time. In addition, if a quorum is present, then the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the
adjournment proposal may approve the adjournment proposal and adjourn the meeting. In addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it
commences. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional votes, stockholders who have already submitted
their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If you return a signed proxy and do not indicate how you wish
to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

Adjustments to the Merger Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, CorePoint
common stockholders will have the right to receive, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, (i) $15.65 in cash plus (ii), if applicable,
incremental cash consideration per share in certain circumstances if CorePoint resolves prior to the closing the previously disclosed tax proceedings,
which we refer to as the “IRS Matter,” with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) related to an ongoing audit of CorePoint entities in existence prior to
CorePoint’s 2018 spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc., less (iii) the per share amount of any dividends paid to common stockholders between the date of
the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger determined by CorePoint to be necessary to maintain CorePoint’s qualification for taxation as a
REIT, although CorePoint does not expect any such dividends to be paid, as further discussed below (collectively, the “per share merger consideration”),
for each share of CorePoint common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than any cancelled shares or
converted shares or Restricted Stock (as defined below)).
IRS Closing Agreement. The payment of any such additional cash consideration, as described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph
entitled “Adjustments to Merger Consideration” above, is dependent on CorePoint entering into a definitive closing agreement with the IRS prior to the
closing. The amount of such potential additional cash consideration, if any, payable to holders of CorePoint common stock is determined based on the
amount, if any, by which the settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued interest with respect thereto) is less
than $160 million. CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on November 5, 2021. On the basis of such offer,
CorePoint entered into a settlement agreement on Form 870-AD with the IRS on November 29, 2021 (the “November 29 Closing Agreement”), which
provides for total payments by CorePoint of approximately $89.6 million plus statutory interest through the date of payment to the IRS. Pursuant to the
November 29 Closing Agreement, the total payment amount for the settlement of the IRS Matter is dependent on the calculation of interest by the IRS,
which includes a determination by the IRS of the applicable statutory interest rates and applicable time periods, and the date on which the settlement
payment (including interest as calculated by the IRS) is made to the IRS. As a result, CorePoint cannot determine the total payment amount with
specificity as of the date of this proxy statement. However, pursuant to the November 29 Closing Agreement, based on the foregoing and assuming that
CorePoint makes the settlement payment to the IRS on or about the date of the effective time of the merger, CorePoint currently estimates that the amount
of any such additional consideration will likely be between approximately $0.10 per share and approximately $0.35 per share, although there can be no
assurance that any such additional consideration will fall within that range. Following receipt by CorePoint of the determination by the IRS of the
applicable statutory interest rate and calculation by the IRS of the interest payable, CorePoint expects to inform the holders of CorePoint common stock
of the expected amount of any additional consideration as determined based on such calculation by the IRS. In connection with the closing, CorePoint
expects to inform the holders of CorePoint of the definitive amount of any such additional consideration. There can be no assurances that any additional
consideration will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock. CorePoint’s entry into any IRS settlement is not a condition to the closing of
the merger.

Special Dividend. The potential reduction of the cash consideration by the per share amount of any dividends paid to common stockholders between the
date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, as described in clause (iii) of the paragraph entitled “Adjustments to Merger
Consideration” above, is dependent on CorePoint determining the payment of such dividends to be necessary to maintain CorePoint’s qualification for
taxation as a REIT. CorePoint does not currently expect the payment of any such dividend prior
to the effective time of the merger to be necessary to maintain CorePoint’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, and as such does not currently expect any
corresponding reduction of the cash consideration as a result of such dividend.

CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,Treatment of CorePoint Equity Awards,"Treatment of CorePoint Equity Awards
The merger agreement provides that outstanding equity-based awards issued under CorePoint’s equity incentive plans will be treated as set forth below:
Stock Units. Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding share of CorePoint common stock subject to vesting restrictions (“Restricted
Stock”), restricted stock unit (other than a performance-based restricted stock unit (“PSU”)) (“RSU”) or deferred stock unit granted under the CorePoint
2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (each, a “Stock Unit”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become
immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Unit will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the effective time,
an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such Stock Unit immediately prior to the effective time
multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the terms of any
applicable Stock Unit award agreement (“dividend equivalent rights”), less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
PSUs. Immediately prior to the effective time, each PSU will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become
immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of each such PSU will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the effective time,
an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time, calculated
based on the greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with the terms of such PSU, and (B) target level
performance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalent rights provided under the
terms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
Effects on CorePoint if the Merger Is Not Completed",43,43
CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,Effects on CorePoint if the Merger Is Not Completed,"Effects on CorePoint if the Merger Is Not Completed
If the merger proposal is not approved by CorePoint stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, CorePoint stockholders will not
receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, CorePoint will remain an independent public company and shares of
CorePoint common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, CorePoint expects that management will operate CorePoint’s business in a manner similar
to that in which it is being operated today and that CorePoint stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they
are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive industry in which CorePoint operates and adverse economic
conditions. Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is
likely that the price of CorePoint’s common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of CorePoint’s
common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be
no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of CorePoint’s common stock.
Further, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, CorePoint may be required to pay Cavalier a termination fee of $29
million or Cavalier may be required to pay CorePoint a
 
35Table of Contents
termination fee of $58 million. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 99 for a discussion of the circumstances under which
such fee may be payable.",43,44

Since CorePoint’s 2018 spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc., the Board and CorePoint’s senior management have regularly reviewed and assessed
CorePoint’s operations and financial performance, industry conditions and related developments as they may impact CorePoint’s long-term strategic
plans and objectives. As part of this ongoing evaluation, the Board, together with CorePoint’s executive management team, has considered various
potential strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value, which have from time to time included evaluations of potential acquisitions or
dispositions of properties (including the ongoing disposition of non-core assets), and other potential financial and strategic alternatives.
In furtherance of its consideration of these types of potential strategic alternatives, the Board and CorePoint’s senior management have discussed a
number of such alternatives with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Hodges Ward Elliot, LLC (“HWE”) from time to time, including during periods
without any formal engagements. CorePoint has sought advice from these advisors for a number of reasons that include J.P. Morgan’s and HWE’s
experience and expertise as financial advisors in a wide variety of transactions and familiarity with CorePoint’s business, including, in the case of J.P.
Morgan, J.P. Morgan’s work as financial advisor to La Quinta Holdings Inc. in connection with the 2018 acquisition of La Quinta Holdings Inc. by
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Wyndham”) and the related spin-off of CorePoint from La Quinta Holdings Inc. In connection with the process that
led to the proposed merger, CorePoint discussed strategic alternatives with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE throughout the course of the events
in 2021 described below, and CorePoint formally entered into engagement letters with J.P. Morgan and HWE as its financial advisors effective as of July
13, 2021 in connection with a potential sale of, or other significant strategic transaction involving, CorePoint. CorePoint has also worked with Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”) from time to time since the completion of the spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc. CorePoint discussed
various matters and the process that led to the proposed merger with representatives of Simpson Thacher throughout the course of the events in 2021
described below.
Throughout the first half of 2021, CorePoint continued to pursue the completion of its ongoing non-core disposition program, which it had commenced in
March 2019, with respect to the sale of its non-core hotel properties as identified in a strategic review of its portfolio. During this period, the Board and
the Capital Committee of the Board (the “Capital Committee”), respectively, held bi-weekly regularly scheduled update calls during alternating weeks, with
representatives of CorePoint management in attendance, to discuss the status of the disposition program and related matters concerning the operations
and strategy of CorePoint. Also, from time to time throughout the first half of 2021, representatives of CorePoint management and the Capital Committee
had a number of informal discussions with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, related to the state of the lodging industry generally,
certain of CorePoint’s peer companies, CorePoint’s disposition strategy and potential strategic alternatives that CorePoint might pursue.
On April 27, 2021, the Capital Committee held a telephonic update call with representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of CorePoint management
in attendance, and a telephonic update call with representatives of HWE and representatives of CorePoint management in attendance. During such calls,
members of the Capital Committee discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, the current state of the lodging industry
generally, the Board’s belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate and lodging markets were generally favorable, certain preliminary
valuation and financial information concerning certain lodging companies, a review of CorePoint’s asset portfolio and current non-core disposition
strategy, certain preliminary projections prepared by CorePoint management concerning CorePoint’s future operating performance and certain potential
strategic alternatives that CorePoint might pursue. The potential strategic alternatives discussed during these calls included scenarios in which CorePoint
would maintain its current strategy by continuing to sell non-core assets and retaining the CorePoint Core Portfolio, continuing to sell non-core assets
but apply the

related proceeds in an effort to grow the CorePoint Core Portfolio, potentially seeking to amend its management relationship with Wyndham, or pursuing
a sale, in a portfolio or company-level transaction or in connection with a liquidation of CorePoint, of all of its properties (including the CorePoint Core
Portfolio). Representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, discussed with the Capital Committee a number of considerations associated with the
possible exploration of a change in control transaction or other strategic alternatives, which considerations included investor sentiment in light of, among
other things, then-current market trends in the lodging industry and in the economy generally (including trends relating to vaccinations against COVID-
19, increases in travel and overall industry demand), CorePoint’s credit profile and the financing market generally, the status and potential resolution of
the IRS Matter (as defined in “The Merger Agreement—IRS Matter” beginning on page 72) and the status of, and implications regarding, the
management agreements with Wyndham.
On April 30, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of Simpson Thacher in
attendance. Representatives of CorePoint management provided the Board with an overview of CorePoint’s results of operations for the first quarter of
2021 and the status of CorePoint’s non-core asset disposition program. Members of the Capital Committee provided the Board with an overview of their
recent discussions with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, and members of the Board discussed with CorePoint management various
considerations associated with a possible exploration of a change in control transaction or other potential strategic alternatives, including recent positive
economic trends and depth of activity in the merger and acquisition market. Key considerations identified by the Board included the status of the IRS
Matter and cooperation from Wyndham that would likely be necessary in connection with a potential change of control transaction, depending on the
structure of any such transaction and the intended treatment in such transaction of the management relationship between CorePoint and Wyndham.
Representatives of CorePoint management provided the Board with an update on the most recent discussions with the appeals team of the IRS that had
occurred earlier that month in connection with the IRS Matter, including related expected timelines for various possible resolutions of the IRS Matter.
Following discussion, upon consultation with the Board’s advisors, members of the Board expressed the view that it could be in the best interest of
CorePoint stockholders for CorePoint to explore a potential change in control transaction in the near term in light of the then-current circumstances,
including CorePoint’s scale, recent trends in the hotel industry and economic indicators, and CorePoint management’s preliminary view of CorePoint’s
standalone forecasts, pending further review and confirmation of those forecasts. The Board instructed CorePoint management to review CorePoint
management’s standalone forecasts.
On May 18, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of Simpson Thacher in
attendance. Representatives of Simpson Thacher discussed with the members of the Board a number of considerations and potential decision points in
connection with a possible continued evaluation by the Board of potential strategic alternatives for CorePoint, and reminded the members of the Board of
their duties under applicable law.
Over the balance of May and into June, at the instruction of the Board, representatives of CorePoint management worked with representatives of J.P.
Morgan to review CorePoint management’s standalone forecasts and to discuss potential strategic alternatives for CorePoint.
On June 1, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management met in Irving, Texas, with representatives of J.P. Morgan participating telephonically, to review
CorePoint management’s standalone forecasts and to discuss key assumptions underlying such forecasts, including with respect to trends in the hotel
REIT industry. All members of the Board were invited to join the meeting and several members of the Board participated in person, and the Board was
informed that the full Board was going to be updated on the discussions and have the opportunity to review such forecasts and discuss such
assumptions at the meeting of the Board that was scheduled for June 21, 2021.
On June 21, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Simpson
Thacher in attendance. Representatives of CorePoint management

presented to the Board three standalone forecasts for CorePoint, consisting of a base plan and two growth plans, all of which had been prepared by
CorePoint management and reviewed on June 1, 2021 with various members of the Board and representatives of J.P. Morgan. The Board reviewed these
standalone forecasts with representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of CorePoint management. All three forecasts assumed that CorePoint
would sell all of its properties other than the CorePoint Core Portfolio, and the two growth plans also further assumed the use of debt capital following
these dispositions to acquire additional core properties. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management the forecasts
presented, including the potential value creation opportunity of each of these plans, key underlying assumptions utilized in preparing the plans and
perspectives with respect to market trends. The Board also discussed potential next steps in connection with the potential evaluation of strategic
alternatives, as well as the potential impact of the IRS Matter and the management relationship with Wyndham on any such strategic alternatives.
On June 24, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and
CorePoint’s tax counsel in attendance. Representatives of CorePoint’s tax counsel discussed with the Board the status of the IRS Matter, as well as the
potential implications of certain strategic options available to CorePoint relating to the IRS Matter, including with respect to the expected timing of a
potential resolution and various outcome possibilities, the likelihood of a potential settlement, and potential impacts of such outcomes on CorePoint and
its stockholders, both in connection with the operation of CorePoint on a standalone basis, as well as in connection with any potential process for the
evaluation of strategic alternatives.
On July 6, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, presented their respective preliminary financial analyses of
CorePoint based on the forecasts prepared by CorePoint management. At the instruction of the Board, J.P. Morgan and HWE referred to the base plan
prepared by CorePoint management, which constituted the CorePoint Projections (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financial Projections”
beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement), for purposes of their respective analyses with respect to the potential transaction, which the Board
considered to be the most appropriate of the three plans prepared by CorePoint management for such purposes in light of the Board’s view of CorePoint’s
business and underlying factors such as trends in the hotel REIT industry. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and
HWE, respectively, their respective preliminary analyses as well as various potential alternatives available to CorePoint after the completion of the
disposition of its non-core assets, both with respect to the continued operation on a standalone basis as well as with respect to the disposition of all of
the CorePoint properties (including the CorePoint Core Portfolio) in a sale, in a portfolio or company-level transaction, or in connection with a liquidation
of CorePoint. Members of the Board discussed with CorePoint’s legal and financial advisors various considerations relating to a potential sale, including
investor sentiment for the lodging sector, availability of debt financing for a potential acquiror, the status and likelihood of a potential resolution of the
IRS Matter, and cooperation from Wyndham that would likely be necessary in connection with such a transaction. Consistent with previous discussions,
members of the Board expressed the view that any potential acquiror of CorePoint would likely need to conduct extensive due diligence with respect to
the IRS Matter and that it could be beneficial to CorePoint and its stockholders in connection with a potential sale process to have certainty as to the
potential exposure to CorePoint resulting from the IRS Matter. Members of the Board also discussed with its legal and financial advisors risks and
benefits of a broad auction process as opposed to a targeted solicitation of potential buyers, and risks and benefits of a public announcement of the
exploration of strategic alternatives in connection with such a process, as well as potential timelines and work streams. Following discussion, the Board
determined to further explore strategic alternatives and to publicly announce that CorePoint was engaging in such exploration of strategic alternatives.
The Board also determined that in connection with this strategic review process, CorePoint’s tax advisors should explore the amount, if any, at which the
IRS may be interested in making a settlement proposal to CorePoint.
Over the course of the following months, at the instruction of the Board, CorePoint’s tax advisors continued to work with the IRS appeals team in order to
ascertain the amount, if any, at which the IRS would be prepared to make a settlement proposal to CorePoint.

On July 8, 2021, CorePoint submitted a request for post-appeals mediation with respect to the IRS Matter to the IRS appeals team.
On July 13, 2021, at the instruction of the Board, CorePoint publicly announced that it had decided to explore strategic alternatives to maximize
stockholder value.
Also on July 13, 2021, CorePoint entered into engagement letters with J.P. Morgan and HWE.
Over the course of July and August 2021, at the instruction of the Board, CorePoint management and its advisors engaged with potential acquirors,
prepared process letters, confidentiality agreements and information materials, established a virtual data room, conducted management presentations and
site visits, and prepared drafts of definitive transaction documents.
During this time, representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE reached out to, or were approached by, approximately 70 potential acquirors of CorePoint. Of
those parties, approximately 52 initially requested to enter into a confidentiality agreement, and 41 parties, including Highgate Holdings, Inc. (“Highgate”)
and Cerberus Capital Management (“Cerberus”), executed confidentiality agreements with CorePoint, all of which included certain standstill provisions
that automatically fell away upon the announcement of the proposed merger.
On July 26, 2021, the IRS appeals team issued a letter denying CorePoint’s request for post-appeals mediation with respect to the IRS Matter.
On July 29, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and
CorePoint’s tax counsel in attendance. Representatives of CorePoint’s tax counsel discussed with the Board the status of the IRS Matter, the recent denial
by the IRS of CorePoint’s request for post-appeals mediation, certain potential approaches available to CorePoint and the potential implications thereof,
and expectations regarding the timing of a potential resolution through litigation in tax court or through other IRS audit resolutions. Members of the
Board also discussed potential impacts of various outcomes on CorePoint and its stockholders, both in connection with the operation of CorePoint on a
standalone basis as well as with respect to the ongoing auction process in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives for CorePoint.
From time to time following the public announcement of CorePoint’s exploration of strategic alternatives, representatives of Wyndham management
contacted representatives of CorePoint management to discuss the potential impact of a change of control transaction on the management relationship
between Wyndham and CorePoint. Throughout this time, representatives of CorePoint management and members of the Board had a number of
discussions with CorePoint’s advisors with respect to these matters and determined that it could be beneficial to CorePoint to coordinate with Wyndham
on this aspect of a transaction prior to any public announcement of a definitive agreement with respect to the potential sale of CorePoint. Upon
consultation with CorePoint’s advisors, CorePoint management determined that it would engage in more formal discussions with Wyndham if the sales
process were to advance to a second round.
Beginning on August 2, 2021, CorePoint provided the parties that had entered into confidentiality agreements with access to CorePoint’s virtual data
room and first-round due diligence information, including the CorePoint Projections (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financial
Projections” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement) for fiscal year 2021, and only for fiscal year 2021. In addition, on August 10, 2021,
representatives of J.P. Morgan sent to the parties that had entered into confidentiality agreements a process letter instructing such parties to submit initial
indications of interests by August 31, 2021.
On August 31, 2021, nine bidders submitted first-round non-binding indications of interest. These bidders included Highgate, a consortium consisting of
three parties which we hereafter refer to as Party A, and a bidder whom we hereafter refer to as Party B. At the instruction of CorePoint, J.P. Morgan and
HWE had instructed the bidders not to assign a value to CorePoint’s potential liabilities arising from the IRS Matter in connection with these initial
indications of interest. Cerberus did not submit a separate indication of interest, but representatives of Highgate contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan
to request that Highgate be permitted to cooperate with Cerberus as an equity financing source in connection with the process going forward.

On September 1, 2021, the Capital Committee held a telephonic update call with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P.
Morgan, HWE and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an update to the Capital Committee regarding the status of
the auction process and reviewed with the Capital Committee the first-round non-binding indications of interest received from the nine bidders. Members
of the Capital Committee and representatives of CorePoint management discussed with their advisors the terms of these indications of interest. The
Capital Committee also discussed the risks and benefits relating to potential resolutions of the IRS Matter prior to the completion of the process, if any,
and the approach towards an engagement with Wyndham. Following discussion, the Capital Committee determined to recommend to the Board that
CorePoint should proceed to the second round of the sale process.
On September 3, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an update to the Board regarding the status of the auction process and
reviewed with the Board the first-round non-binding indications of interest received from the nine bidders. Members of the Board discussed with
CorePoint’s advisors and representatives of CorePoint management the terms of these indications of interest, as well as various requests from certain
bidders for permission to cooperate with other counterparties, including potential equity or debt financing sources or operating partners, and the
potential impact thereof on second-round indications of interests. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with the Board certain considerations
relating to timing and strategy for the potential second round of the process and the responses to be delivered to the various bidders. The Board
considered risks and benefits of a potential sale of CorePoint as compared to risks and benefits associated with possible strategic alternatives and
CorePoint’s long-term strategic plan as an independent public company. Also at this meeting, the Board discussed the status of CorePoint’s non-core
asset dispositions, the likelihood of a potential resolution of the IRS Matter, and the approach towards an engagement with Wyndham. As it relates to the
IRS Matter, the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the due diligence that second-round bidders would need
to perform with respect to the IRS Matter in order to evaluate and attempt to quantify the expected exposure, and potential options to allocate risk relating
to the IRS Matter between CorePoint and a potential acquiror or to otherwise provide certainty as to the amount of any liability relating to the IRS Matter.
Following discussion, the Board instructed management and its advisors to invite the six bidders with the highest proposed valuations, including
Highgate, Party A and Party B, to proceed to the second round of the process, to make available to such parties additional information in CorePoint’s
virtual data room and drafts of the definitive transaction agreements. Upon consultation with its advisors, the Board determined to permit Highgate to
cooperate with Cerberus as an equity financing source in connection with the process going forward. The Board also determined to engage with
Wyndham with respect to the terms of any potential cooperation from Wyndham that might be beneficial to CorePoint in connection with a potential
change of control transaction and determined that it could be beneficial to the auction process if the amount of any liability relating to the IRS Matter
could be determined prior to the conclusion of the process, but the Board determined not to make a settlement offer to the IRS at such time.
Following the meeting, at the instruction of the Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan invited the six selected bidders, including Highgate, Party A, and
Party B, to the second round of the process, and authorized Highgate to cooperate with Cerberus in connection with its potential second-round
indication of interest.
After initiating the second round of the process, in September 2021, additional information was made available to the second-round bidders in
CorePoint’s virtual data room, including drafts of the definitive transaction agreements, and on October 1, 2021, at the instruction of the Board,
representatives of J.P. Morgan sent to the second-round bidders a process letter, requesting second-round bids be submitted by October 15, 2021, which
date was subsequently extended to October 16, 2021.
On September 8, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of Simpson Thacher and
CorePoint’s tax counsel in attendance, at which representatives of CorePoint’s tax counsel informed the Board of the status of the IRS Matter.

On September 29, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Simpson
Thacher and CorePoint’s tax counsel in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of CorePoint management provided an update to the Board regarding
the status of the auction process and the status of discussions with Wyndham, and representatives of CorePoint’s tax counsel informed the Board of the
status of the IRS Matter.
Over the course of September and up until the second-round bid deadline of October 16, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management conducted
various due diligence calls with second-round bidders and their respective advisors. Throughout this process, various bidders expressed the need for
clarity as to the proposed treatment of the management relationship between CorePoint and Wyndham in connection with a potential transaction. During
this time, at the instruction of the Board, representatives of CorePoint management discussed with representatives of Wyndham management the
potential terms of the parties’ cooperation in connection with a potential change of control transaction of CorePoint. Also during this period of time, the
second-round bidders and their respective advisors engaged in tax due diligence with respect to the IRS Matter, including due diligence calls with
CorePoint’s tax counsel and tax advisors. CorePoint made available documentation intended to enable bidders to evaluate and attempt to quantify the
potential exposure resulting from the IRS Matter, which documentation, in CorePoint’s view, supported a conclusion that, although CorePoint intended to
pursue litigation with respect to the IRS Matter, it would be reasonable for a bidder to assume the exposure to CorePoint resulting from the IRS Matter
was unlikely to exceed approximately $160 million.
In addition, representatives of CorePoint’s tax counsel continued to work with the IRS appeals team in an effort to explore the amount, if any, at which the
IRS would be willing to make a settlement proposal with respect to the IRS Matter.
Throughout this period, the Board and the Capital Committee continued to hold bi-weekly update calls on alternating weeks, during which members of
the Board and the Capital Committee discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the status of the sales process, the IRS
Matter and the discussions with Wyndham.  
On October 7, 2021, representatives of counsel to Highgate/Cerberus and representatives of counsel to Party A, respectively, submitted draft markups of
the definitive transaction agreements to Simpson Thacher, and representatives of counsel to Party B provided high level reactions to the draft transaction
agreements to Simpson Thacher.
On October 11, 2021, following discussions with representatives of CorePoint management and members of the Board, at the instruction of CorePoint,
representatives of Simpson Thacher provided feedback to counsel to Highgate/Cerberus and counsel to Party A, respectively, with respect to their
proposed markups of the transaction agreements.
On October 12, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management, members of the Board and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Simpson Thacher
discussed the terms of a potential non-binding letter of intent with Wyndham and its potential impact on the second-round process and the timing of
second-round indications of interest, which were due later that week.
On October 14, 2021, CorePoint and affiliates of Wyndham entered into a non-binding letter of intent providing, among other things, that upon the
consummation of a change of control of CorePoint, all remaining hotel management agreements would be terminated, all franchise agreements would be
transferred or replaced with new La Quinta franchise agreements, Wyndham would cooperate with CorePoint in facilitating the proposed transaction and
winding down the management relationship between the parties, and CorePoint would pay to Wyndham or its affiliates certain termination fees of
approximately $84 million. At the instruction of CorePoint, representatives of J.P. Morgan made available to the second-round bidders a copy of the
executed non-binding letter of intent prior to the submission of second-round indications of interest.

Between October 15, 2021 and October 16, 2021, each of Highgate/Cerberus, Party A and Party B submitted second-round non-binding indications of
interest and draft markups of the transaction agreements, which, in the case of each of Highgate/Cerberus and Party A, reflected improvements of certain
key terms in response to the feedback delivered by representatives of Simpson Thacher based on their respective initial drafts. Each of the bidders also
requested to enter into a support agreement with the Blackstone parties pursuant to which the Blackstone parties would agree to vote their shares in
favor of a potential transaction. Each of the other three parties that had been invited into the second round of the process informed representatives of J.P.
Morgan that it did not intend to submit a second-round indication of interest. The valuations proposed by Highgate/Cerberus and Party A were each
higher than the valuation proposed by Party B. The Highgate/Cerberus proposal at this time was for $14.42 per share in cash, after taking into account the
adjustment for the IRS Matter. For purposes of their second round bids, taking into account the due diligence documentation made available to bidders
by CorePoint as discussed above, all three parties estimated the likely exposure to CorePoint resulting from the IRS Matter at approximately $160 million.
During the course of the second round due diligence, bidders were encouraged to assume the risk of any liability arising from the IRS Matter in excess of
a specified amount and to provide CorePoint stockholders with the ability to receive incremental consideration if the IRS Matter was settled for an
amount less than any such specified amount.
On October 17, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board the three second-round non-binding indications of interests
received, including the proposed valuations and proposed terms relating to the treatment of the IRS Matter. Representatives of CorePoint management
discussed with the Board and CorePoint’s advisers that all three bidders had expressed concern with respect to the potential liability arising from the IRS
Matter and had determined to price in approximately $160 million for such exposure (which included potential interest payable to the IRS) when arriving at
their proposed equity valuation. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the terms of the
indications of interest, potential strategy relating to responses to the three bidders, the status of discussions with the IRS appeals team with respect to
the IRS Matter, the process for negotiating a definitive agreement with Wyndham, and the impact of the foregoing on the potential timing for the
announcement of a transaction.
Following discussion at the October 17, 2021 meeting, the Board determined that each of Highgate/Cerberus and Party A, as the two bidders that had the
highest valuation proposals and that were the furthest along in terms of being prepared to execute definitive documentation and provide committed
financing, should be invited to submit improved final proposals. The Board also instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to seek to finalize a
definitive agreement with Wyndham and to continue to attempt to determine the amount, if any, at which the IRS would be willing to make a settlement
offer with respect to the IRS Matter. Given the Board’s desire for clarity as to the proposed approach with respect to the IRS Matter, the Board also
instructed representatives of J.P. Morgan and Simpson Thacher to inform the two final bidders that the Board requested each party to submit final
proposals that met certain specified criteria regarding the treatment of the IRS Matter. These requests included the absence of any closing condition
relating to the IRS Matter; the absence of any downside risk to CorePoint stockholders in the event the liability relating to the IRS Matter were to exceed
$160 million; and an ability for CorePoint stockholders to participate in the benefit of any settlement of the IRS Matter below the $160 million estimate that
bidders had placed on such liability if such settlement were reached by or shortly following closing.
During the week of October 18, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Highgate the terms of the Highgate/Cerberus
indication of interest, particularly with respect to their proposed treatment of the IRS Matter. During such discussions, representatives of Highgate
informed J.P. Morgan that Highgate/Cerberus insisted on a closing condition regarding a settlement of the IRS Matter and a provision allocating any
liability in excess of $160 million (including interest) to CorePoint stockholders, both of which provisions were inconsistent with the terms proposed by
CorePoint at the request of the Board. Also during this week, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party A the terms of Party
A’s indication
 
42
Table of Contents
of interest. During such discussions, representatives of Party A substantially accepted the terms proposed by CorePoint at the request of the Board
regarding the IRS Matter. Also during this week, both Highgate/Cerberus and Party A submitted to J.P. Morgan revised indications of interest, each at an
increased valuation. By October 22, 2021, the Highgate/Cerberus proposal had been further increased, but the proposed consideration was subject to
decrease in connection with the IRS Matter if the liability thereunder exceeded $160 million, and the proposal contained a provision that would, in the
absence of a settlement of the IRS Matter, permit Highgate/Cerberus not to close the merger but instead acquire substantially all of the assets of
CorePoint while CorePoint and its stockholders would retain the liability resulting from the IRS Matter. Party A had also further increased its proposal and
the difference between the two bidders’ respective valuations at this time was not material, but Party A’s proposal was not subject to decrease in
connection with the IRS Matter, and, as noted above, Party A had also substantially accepted the other terms proposed by CorePoint at the request of
the Board regarding the IRS Matter.
On October 22, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the status of the final
round bid process, the negotiations with Wyndham and the likelihood of obtaining a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter.
Representatives of Simpson Thacher reminded the members of the Board of their duties under applicable law. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed the
Board of the recent discussions with representatives of Party A and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus, respectively. In light of the more favorable
terms presented by Party A with respect to conditionality and potential downside risk to CorePoint stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, the Board,
upon consultation with its advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to work with Party A to finalize definitive agreements.
Over the course of the following days and throughout the week of October 25, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors worked
with representatives of Party A and its advisors to finalize definitive transaction agreements and with representatives of Wyndham to finalize a definitive
agreement reflecting the October 14th letter of intent. Also during this time, Party B submitted a revised indication of interest, which reflected a valuation
below the most recent indications of interest submitted by both Highgate/Cerberus and by Party A.
During the week of October 25, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a draft support agreement to counsel to the Blackstone parties, which
provided, among other things, that the Blackstone parties would agree to vote their shares in favor of a transaction.
Also during the course of the week of October 25, 2021, Highgate/Cerberus submitted to J.P. Morgan a revised proposal at a modestly increased valuation
but which continued to provide that the consideration would be subject to decrease in connection with the IRS Matter if the liability thereunder exceeded
$160 million, and the proposal continued to contain a provision that would, in the absence of a settlement of the IRS Matter, permit Highgate/Cerberus
not to close the merger but instead acquire substantially all of the assets of CorePoint while CorePoint and its stockholders would retain the liability
resulting from the IRS Matter.
On October 27, 2021, the IRS appeals team proposed to schedule a call with CorePoint’s tax counsel for November 5, 2021, relating to the possibility of a
settlement proposal from the IRS regarding the IRS Matter.
On October 28, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed again with the Board the revised indications of interest received from all three
parties, including a discussion and comparison of the proposed valuations and the proposed treatment of the IRS Matter reflected in each proposal, and
also the recent trading performance of CorePoint common stock. The Board considered the fact that the closing price of CorePoint common stock had
increased significantly since CorePoint’s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process and that the indications of interest received from all
three
 
43
Table of Contents
parties reflected a discount to the most recent closing price per share of CorePoint common stock, but the Board noted that the indications of interest
from Highgate/Cerberus and Party A both reflected a premium in excess of 30% to CorePoint’s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day
prior to CorePoint’s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process. The most recent proposal from Highgate/Cerberus reflected a valuation
that was modestly higher than the proposal from Party A. However, the Highgate/Cerberus proposal remained subject to a closing condition with respect
to an IRS settlement and provided for economic downside risk to CorePoint stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, neither of which terms were reflected
in Party A’s proposal. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the indications of interest
received, the status of the negotiation of definitive documents with Party A, which were nearly finalized, and the prospect of potentially obtaining a
settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter during the upcoming November 5, 2021 call with the IRS appeals team. The Board determined
to continue working with Party A in an effort to finalize mutually agreeable definitive documentation but not to enter into a definitive agreement with
Party A prior to receiving an update from CorePoint’s tax counsel immediately following the November 5, 2021 call with the IRS appeals team.
At the instruction of the Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed representatives of Party A of the Board’s determination and the expected timing
for the potential announcement of a transaction. Over the course of the following days, representatives of CorePoint’s advisors and representatives of
Party A’s advisers continued to work toward finalization of definitive transaction agreements.
There was no substantive communication between representatives of CorePoint and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus following the October 28, 2021
Board meeting until representatives from J.P. Morgan received a revised proposal from Highgate/Cerberus close to midnight on October 31, 2021. This
proposal reflected the same valuation as the most recent Highgate/Cerberus proposal submitted during the week of October 25, 2021, removed the closing
condition relating to the settlement of the IRS matter, but retained provisions that provided for economic downside risk to CorePoint stockholders relating
to the IRS Matter. Then, on November 1, 2021, representatives of counsel to Highgate/Cerberus submitted updated provisions to the draft transaction
documents relating to the IRS Matter, which provisions continued to retain provisions that provided for economic downside risk to CorePoint
stockholders relating to the IRS Matter and otherwise remained inconsistent with the terms relating to the IRS Matter previously proposed by CorePoint
at the request of the Board and accepted by Party A.
On November 2, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board the revised indication from Highgate/Cerberus, which continued
to reflect a valuation that was modestly higher than Party A’s proposal. In light of the fact that the respective valuations of the two proposals were close
to each other and that the terms presented by Party A continued to be more favorable with respect to conditionality and potential downside risk to
CorePoint stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, the Board, upon consultation with its advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to
continue to work with Party A to finalize definitive agreements. In advance of the meeting, the Board was informed about certain relationships between
J.P. Morgan and its affiliates and Blackstone, Cerberus and Highgate, respectively, as described in more detail in “The Merger – Opinion of J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC” on page 53.
There was no substantive communication between representatives of CorePoint and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus following the November 2,
2021 Board meeting until Highgate/Cerberus submitted a further revised proposal on November 4, 2021. This proposal reflected an increased valuation,
which was higher than the proposal from Party A, and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus suggested to representatives of J.P. Morgan that
Highgate/Cerberus was now willing to accept the terms relating to the IRS Matter previously proposed by CorePoint at the request of the Board, which
had been accepted by Party A.
On November 4, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and
Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan
 
44
Table of Contents
reviewed with the Board the revised indication from Highgate/Cerberus. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board J.P. Morgan’s
preliminary financial analysis with respect to the indications of interest from Party A and from Highgate/Cerberus. Representatives of Simpson Thacher
reminded the members of the Board of their duties under applicable law. In light of the higher purchase price proposed by Highgate/Cerberus, and the
willingness expressed by their representatives to accept more favorable terms with respect to conditionality and potential downside risk to CorePoint
stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, the Board, upon consultation with its advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to send to
Highgate/Cerberus the proposed transaction documents that reflected such terms in a form that CorePoint would be willing to execute and to request
confirmation that Highgate/Cerberus was prepared to enter into definitive agreements on such terms in advance of the Board meeting that was scheduled
for the afternoon of the following day. Following the meeting, in the evening of November 4, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated these
instructions to representatives of Highgate/Cerberus.
In the afternoon of November 5, 2021, CorePoint’s tax counsel conducted a call with the IRS appeals team, during which the IRS submitted a settlement
offer, subsequently confirmed in writing on the same day, with respect to the IRS Matter, which would provide for total payments by CorePoint of
approximately $89.6 million plus statutory interest through the date of payment. Pursuant to this settlement offer, CorePoint estimated the total payment
amount under the merger agreement pursuant to the settlement would be less than $160 million, and any additional consideration payable at the closing
of the merger to CorePoint stockholders would likely be approximately $0.10 per share.
Also in the afternoon of November 5, 2021, representatives of Highgate/Cerberus submitted revised transaction documents, which substantially accepted
all of the terms reflected in the drafts provided by CorePoint on the previous day.
Also on November 5, 2021, CorePoint and affiliates of Wyndham entered into a definitive agreement on terms substantially consistent with the non-
binding letter of intent that had been made available to bidders prior to the submission of second-round indications of interest, which definitive
agreement would become effective upon announcement of a change of control transaction of CorePoint.
In the evening of November 5, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P.
Morgan, HWE and Simpson Thacher in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of CorePoint’s legal and financial advisors updated the Board with
respect to the developments over the past two days and informed the Board that the most recent proposals from Highgate/Cerberus and Party A,
respectively, were now on substantially the same terms and that the proposal from Highgate/Cerberus reflected a modestly higher valuation than Party
A’s proposal. Representatives of CorePoint management reviewed with the Board the settlement offer from the IRS. The Board, upon consultation with its
advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to communicate the IRS settlement proposal to both Party A and Highgate/Cerberus, to
inform both bidders that the Board was planning to convene on the following day in order to evaluate the parties’ respective proposals, and to request
each bidder to submit its best and final proposal, finalize all transaction documents and be in a position to sign a definitive agreement promptly following
the meeting of the Board on November 6, 2021. Following the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated these instructions to representatives
of Highgate/Cerberus and Party A, respectively.
On November 6, 2021, both bidders submitted their respective best and final proposals. Party A submitted a revised proposal, which reflected a
moderately increased valuation. However, the proposal from Highgate/Cerberus remained the highest valuation received at $15.65 per share, after taking
into account the adjustment for the IRS Matter and subject to incremental consideration in the event of a settlement of the IRS Matter for less than $160
million (which valuation reflected a $1.23 per share increase from the second round bid submitted by Highgate/Cerberus) and both proposals were
otherwise on substantially the same terms.
Later on November 6, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE
and Simpson Thacher in attendance. At the meeting,

Table of Contents
representatives of CorePoint management updated the Board on the status of the negotiations with Party A and Highgate/Cerberus, including stating
that all open issues with respect to the terms of a potential transaction with either of the two parties had been resolved and definitive documentation had
been finalized. The Board discussed with its legal and financial advisors that the merger consideration contemplated by the final proposal from
Highgate/Cerberus was higher than the consideration contemplated by the final proposal from Party A and that both proposals were otherwise on
substantially the same terms, and that both bidders stood ready in a position to enter into a transaction with CorePoint promptly following the meeting.
The Board considered the risks and benefits of the proposed merger as compared to the possible strategic alternatives that the Board had considered
throughout the process leading up to the announcement of the proposed merger, as well as CorePoint’s long-term strategic plan as an independent public
company and the risks associated with executing such plan. The counterparty to the merger agreement with Highgate/Cerberus was Cavalier, an entity
controlled by Highgate and Cerberus.
At this meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Board J.P. Morgan’s financial analysis of the potential transaction. Following
further discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan then rendered its oral opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its
opinion, the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion to the Board. The Board considered the fact that
the closing price of CorePoint common stock had increased significantly since CorePoint’s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process and
that the indications of interest received from all three parties reflected a discount to the most recent closing price per share of CorePoint common stock,
but the Board noted that the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger represented a
premium of approximately 42% to CorePoint’s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day prior to the CorePoint’s public announcement of its
strategic alternatives process. The Board also considered that, aside from their interests as CorePoint stockholders, CorePoint’s directors and executive
officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other CorePoint stockholders generally, as described in
more detail in “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement.
Representatives of CorePoint management discussed with the Board and representatives of Simpson Thacher the fact that there had been no discussions
during the course of the process leading up to the proposed merger between members of CorePoint management and representatives of
Highgate/Cerberus or Party A or other potential acquirors regarding potential employment or compensation arrangements for members of CorePoint
management following the consummation of a potential transaction with CorePoint. Representatives of Simpson Thacher then reviewed with the Board
their duties under applicable law and the terms of the merger agreement. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board met in executive session, during
which Mr. Cutaia noted, as previously reported to the Board, that neither of the Blackstone parties had a need to sell its shares in the near-term, that their
objective had been and continued to be for CorePoint to pursue whatever strategy the Board believed would maximize CorePoint’s value for all of
CorePoint’s stockholders, and that each believed that the proposed transaction would, in fact, maximize CorePoint’s value for all of CorePoint’s
stockholders. Representatives of Simpson Thacher also reviewed with the Board the relationship between Simpson Thacher and Blackstone and its
affiliates.
After further discussion, the Board unanimously determined at the meeting that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
were advisable and in the best interest of CorePoint and CorePoint stockholders, approved and adopted the merger agreement, declared advisable,
approved and authorized the entry into the merger agreement, the merger, and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, resolved that the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by
CorePoint common stockholders at a special meeting of CorePoint stockholders and resolved to recommend that CorePoint stockholders approve the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

In the evening of November 6, 2021, CorePoint and Cavalier executed the merger agreement and the Blackstone parties and Cavalier entered into the
support agreement.
On November 7, 2021, Party B submitted a revised indication of interest, which reflected a valuation below the merger consideration and below the final
proposal from Party A.
On November 8, 2021, prior to the opening of trading, CorePoint and Highgate/Cerberus issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the
merger agreement.
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger",44,55
CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger,"Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger
The Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
After consideration of various factors, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
were advisable and in the best interest of CorePoint and CorePoint stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted the merger agreement, (iii) declared advisable,
approved and authorized the entry into the merger agreement, the merger, and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, (iv) resolved that the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be submitted for consideration
by CorePoint common stockholders at a special meeting of CorePoint stockholders and (v) resolved to recommend that CorePoint stockholders approve
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
When you consider the Board’s recommendation, you should be aware that CorePoint’s executive officers and directors may have interests in the merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CorePoint stockholders generally. These interests are described in “The Merger—Interests of
CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Factors Considered Supporting Approval of the Merger.
In the course of reaching its decision, the Board consulted with members of CorePoint’s senior management and our financial and legal advisors,
considered a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors that it believed supported its decision, including the following (not
necessarily in order of relative importance):
The merger consideration represents a significant premium to CorePoint’s unaffected stock price. The Board considered the current and historical
trading prices of our shares of common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration
that may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) represents a premium of approximately 42% to CorePoint’s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the
last trading day prior to CorePoint’s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process.
Process to explore a sale of the company; Market Check. The Board considered the thorough and diligent transaction process that CorePoint undertook,
with the assistance of its financial advisors at the Board’s direction, to evaluate its strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of CorePoint. In
connection with CorePoint’s publicly announced strategic alternatives process, CorePoint, together with its outside advisors and representatives,
contacted or was contacted by approximately 70 potential acquirors of CorePoint and executed 41 confidentiality agreements. Throughout the process,
the Board was advised by experienced legal counsel and financial advisors, conducted extensive deliberations and met frequently to review potential
strategic alternatives with its advisors. Of the 41 parties that executed confidentiality agreements, 9 parties submitted first-round indications of interests,
6 parties were invited into the second round of the process, 3 parties submitted second-round indications of interest, and CorePoint negotiated multiple
price increases from each of those 3 parties during the final weeks of the process, as more fully described above under “The Merger—Background of the
Merger” beginning on page 36. Following several weeks of arms-length negotiations, on November 6,
 
47Table of Contents
2021, both Cavalier and Party A submitted proposals which the Board believed, based on the nature of the negotiations, to reflect the maximum price that
each of the parties was willing to pay and the terms most favorable to CorePoint and its stockholders to which each party was willing to agree, which
consisted of definitive, fully negotiated and fully financed proposals in executable form. The merger consideration contemplated by the final proposal
from Cavalier was higher than the consideration contemplated by the final proposal from Party A, and both proposals were otherwise on substantially the
same terms. The Board believed that, in light of the strategic alternatives process we engaged in, the responses we received from participants in the
process and the best and final offers received from each of Cavalier and Party A, it was unlikely that any other party would be willing to acquire
CorePoint at an all-cash price in excess of the merger consideration.
Strategic alternatives to a sale of the company. The Board considered the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing CorePoint
stockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the merger (including the potential stockholder value that could be expected to be
generated from remaining an independent public company based on continuing our standalone business plan including the disposition of all of our
properties other than the CorePoint Core Portfolio, or based on our growth business plans that also further assume the use of debt capital following these
dispositions to acquire additional core properties, the possibility to pursue a sale, in a portfolio or company-level transaction or in connection with a
liquidation of CorePoint, of all of the CorePoint Core Portfolio, the possibility of being acquired by other companies, the possibility of acquisitions or
mergers with other companies and other transactions, as well as the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives), and the
timing and likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives. The Board considered these alternatives as compared to the risks and benefits of the proposed
merger.
Risks relating to remaining a standalone company. The Board evaluated CorePoint’s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an independent public
company, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such plan. This evaluation included the Board’s review of our business, operations,
assets, operating results, financial condition, prospects, business strategy, competitive position, terms of our existing management agreement, and
industry, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price of our common stock, to assess the
prospects and risks associated with remaining an independent public company. The Board believed that the certainty provided by the acquisition of
CorePoint by Cavalier for the per share merger consideration of $15.65 (not counting any contingent consideration that may be payable with respect to
the IRS Matter) was more favorable to CorePoint stockholders than the potential risk-weighted value of remaining an independent public company, after
accounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing upon our business and financial plans in the short- and long-term.
Such risks include:
 
 
•
 business, financial and operating risks inherent to the lodging industry;
 
 
•
 macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control, including the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the stage of the lodging
industry’s current recovery from certain of such effects;
 
 
•
 availability and cost of labor, supplies and other operating expenses affecting our operating margins and profitability;
 
 
•
 uncertainties in the current lodging market and competition from market participants that may have more favorable access to capital, and the
limited opportunities to identify, finance and acquire hotel investments at a sufficient risk adjusted rate of return;
 
 
•
 the impact of CorePoint’s size on our ability to compete effectively;
 
 
•
 our ability to source capital at a competitive cost of capital;
 
 
•
 our dependence on our third-party hotel managers and franchisors;
 
 
•
 covenants in our hotel management and franchise agreements that limit or restrict the sale of our hotels;
 
 
•
 expected increases in the interest rates in the current capital markets which could increase the cost of debt;
 
48
Table of Contents
 
•
 federal and state income tax impact from dispositions of our hotels, which could reduce capital for reinvestment, future profitability or
operating cash flow;
 
 
•
 uncertainty over the eventual resolution of the IRS Matter and the potential effects on future operations and availability of capital:
 
 
•
 our ability to maintain profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows; and
 
 
•
 other risks and uncertainties discussed in CorePoint’s public filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning
on page 116 of this proxy statement.
Cash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which, compared to non-cash
consideration, provides certainty of value with respect to the merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that
may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) and immediate liquidity to CorePoint stockholders upon the consummation of the merger, in comparison
to the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in remaining an independent public company or engaging in a transaction in which all or a portion of
the consideration is payable in stock. The Board weighed the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of CorePoint common stock by virtue of
the merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value for the CorePoint common stock would approach the merger consideration in the
foreseeable future, as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with our business.
Potential incremental cash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration of $15.65 per share may be increased by
incremental cash consideration per share in certain circumstances if CorePoint timely resolves the IRS Matter, based on the amount, if any, by which a
final settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued interest with respect thereto) is less than $160 million. The
Board considered the fact that CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on November 5, 2021, has accepted such
offer and entered into a definitive agreement with respect thereto, which remains subject to the calculation by the IRS of applicable interest, which would
provide for total payments by CorePoint of approximately $89.6 million plus statutory interest through the date of payment, as described in more detail in
the section entitled “The Merger—Merger Consideration—What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger” beginning on page 34, although there can be
no assurances that any additional consideration will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock.
High probability of closing. The Board considered the high probability that the merger would be completed based on, among other things, Cerberus’
proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions, Highgate’s extensive experience in the hotel industry, the fact that Cerberus Credit and the
Highgate Sponsors have executed equity commitment letters pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, they have severally
committed to provide an aggregate equity contribution of $297,456,742 in cash, in the case of Cerberus Credit, and $360,681,461 in cash, in the case of the
Highgate Sponsors, for the purpose of funding a portion of the merger consideration pursuant to, and in accordance with, the merger agreement, and the
payment of related fees and expenses in connection with the closing of the merger, the absence of a financing condition for the merger, and the $58 million
reverse termination fee, payable to CorePoint if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is guaranteed by Cerberus
Credit and the Highgate Sponsors pursuant to limited guaranties provided by each of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors.
Favorable conditions. The Board considered its belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate and lodging markets are generally favorable,
with prices for certain real estate assets being at or near historical highs while interest rates are at or near historical lows, and the possibility that interest
rates may rise in the future, which may result in less favorable conditions for sale transactions in the real estate markets.
Regulatory approvals. The Board considered the fact that CorePoint and Cavalier have determined that the filing of notification and report forms under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the “HSR Act”) (or other antitrust laws) will not be necessary to complete the merger, and the Board considered Cavalier’s
obligation under the merger
 
49
Table of Contents
agreement to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and proper under applicable laws and regulations
in a timely manner as are necessary to eliminate each impediment to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and obtain
all approvals required under applicable antitrust laws, subject to certain limitations specified in the merger agreement.
Fairness opinion. The Board considered the financial analyses presented by representatives of J.P. Morgan at the Board’s meeting on November 6, 2021,
as well as the oral opinion delivered by J.P. Morgan to the Board on November 6, 2021, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of J.P. Morgan’s
written opinion to the Board, dated November 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the per share merger
consideration of $15.65 to be paid to CorePoint’s common stockholders in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
stockholders. The J.P. Morgan opinion is more fully described in “The Merger—Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC” and the full text of the written
opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated November 7, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
Merger agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form
of the merger consideration, the potential for CorePoint stockholders to receive incremental merger consideration in certain circumstances in connection
with a settlement of the IRS Matter, the limited conditions to closing, and the customary nature of the representations, warranties, and the covenants and
agreements of the parties. The Board further considered the course and nature of negotiations with Cavalier, which were conducted at arm’s length and
during which the Board was advised by independent legal and financial advisors on a regular basis. The Board took into account the terms of the merger
agreement, including:
 
 
•
 the absence of any closing condition with respect to a settlement of the IRS Matter;
 
 
•
 CorePoint’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with a third party, if the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the third party has made a competing
proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal;
 
 
•
 the right of the Board to change its recommendation that CorePoint stockholders approve the merger in connection with a Superior
Proposal, subject to certain restrictions and the requirement that we pay Cavalier the applicable termination fee of $29 million if the Board
makes a change in recommendation and the merger agreement is terminated as a result;
 
 
•
 the Board’s belief that our obligation to pay Cavalier a termination fee of $29 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances, as well as the right of Cavalier to match any competing proposal that the Board in good faith determines constitutes a
Superior Proposal, are reasonable under the circumstances and would not preclude other potential acquirers from making an alternative
proposal to acquire CorePoint if they were interested in making such a proposal;
 
 
•
 the right of CorePoint to terminate the merger agreement if Cavalier (i) breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
merger agreement such that certain of CorePoint’s closing conditions to consummate the merger would not be satisfied, and fails to timely
cure such breach if curable, or (ii) otherwise fails to consummate the merger in breach of the merger agreement, and the obligation of
Cavalier, under specified circumstances, to pay CorePoint a reverse termination fee of $58 million upon such termination; and
 
 
•
 the right of CorePoint to seek an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies if needed in order to prevent breaches of the
merger agreement by Cavalier.
Cooperation from Wyndham. The Board considered the fact that, pursuant to an agreement entered into between CorePoint and affiliates of Wyndham in
connection with the execution of the merger agreement,
 
50
Table of Contents
Wyndham has agreed to cooperate with CorePoint in facilitating the proposed merger and winding down the management relationship between CorePoint
and Wyndham.  
Board’s independence and comprehensive review process. The Board considered the fact that the Board consisted of a majority of independent directors
who unanimously approved the transaction following extensive discussions with CorePoint’s management team, representatives of its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, and also took into consideration the financial expertise and industry experience held by a number of directors.
Stockholders’ ability to reject the merger. The Board considered the fact that the merger is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of CorePoint
common stock, and that stockholders would be able to reject the merger.
Other Factors Considered by the Board.
In the course of reaching its decision, the Board also considered and balanced against the potential benefits of the merger a number of potentially
adverse factors concerning the merger, including the following:
IRS Matter; incremental consideration. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurances that the IRS Matter will be settled in a timely
manner or that any additional consideration with respect to the IRS Matter will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock.
No further stockholder participation in future gains. The Board considered the fact that CorePoint would no longer exist as an independent public
company following the merger, and that CorePoint stockholders would forgo any future increase in CorePoint’s value following the merger that might
result from our earnings or possible growth as an independent company. Although the Board was optimistic about CorePoint’s prospects on a
standalone basis and our strategic plan, the Board concluded that there were a number of significant risks associated with remaining an independent
company (including as described in more detail above) that in many cases were difficult to quantify and that the merger consideration constituted fair
compensation for the loss of the potential stockholder benefits that could reasonably be expected to be realized by execution of our strategic plan,
particularly on a risk-adjusted basis.
The merger consideration represents a discount to CorePoint’s stock price prior to the announcement of the merger. The Board considered the fact that
the merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) represents a
11.9% discount to the closing price of $17.76 per share of CorePoint common stock on November 5, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public
announcement of the proposed merger. However, the Board also considered that the merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any
contingent consideration that may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) represents a premium of approximately 42% to CorePoint’s closing stock
price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day prior to the CorePoint’s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process.
Payments to Wyndham. The Board considered the fact that, pursuant to an agreement entered into between CorePoint and affiliates of Wyndham in
connection with the execution of the merger agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions of such agreement, in connection with the
announcement and consummation of the proposed merger, CorePoint will be obligated to pay to Wyndham or its affiliates certain termination fees of
approximately $84 million in connection with Wyndham’s cooperation in facilitating the proposed transaction and winding down the management
relationship between CorePoint and Wyndham.  
Risks associated with announcement and pendency of the merger. The Board considered the risk that the announcement and pendency of the merger
may cause substantial harm to our business relationships or relationships with our employees, or may divert management and employee attention away
from the day-to-day operation of our business. The Board also considered our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the
 
51
Table of Contents
proposed transaction is pending and the potential adverse effects on our financial results as a result of that disruption, as well as the possibility of any
suit, action or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
Risks associated with a failure to consummate the merger. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
obligations to consummate the merger will be satisfied, and as a result there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, even if the merger is
approved by CorePoint stockholders. The Board noted the fact that, if the merger is not completed, (i) CorePoint will have incurred significant risk,
transaction expenses and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention,
employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business relationships, (ii) depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be
completed, the price of CorePoint common stock could decline, potentially significantly, and (iii) the market’s perception of CorePoint’s prospects could
be adversely affected.
Restrictions on the operation of our business. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the
merger, which could delay or prevent CorePoint from realizing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations that
we might otherwise take absent the pending merger.
Ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals. The Board considered the fact that the merger agreement precludes us from actively soliciting
alternative proposals. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded to Cavalier under the merger agreement
to re-negotiate the terms of the merger agreement in response to a Superior Proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest
in a business combination with, or an acquisition of, CorePoint. The Board further considered the possibility that the termination fee payable to Cavalier if
the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances might have the effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the
price of such proposals. However, the Board also considered that the structure of the transaction as a merger would result in detailed public disclosure
and substantial time prior to the consummation of the merger during which an unsolicited Superior Proposal could be submitted. In addition, the Board
considered the specific provisions of the merger agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, permit CorePoint to furnish information to
and conduct negotiations with third parties that make unsolicited acquisition proposals, and permit the Board to change its recommendation to CorePoint
stockholders regarding the merger agreement and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee to Cavalier. The Board further considered its belief that the $29 million termination fee payable
by CorePoint (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms of the merger agreement and the benefits of the merger, (ii) was comparable to termination fees
in transactions of a similar size, and (iii) would not preclude another party from making a competing proposal.
Tax treatment. The Board considered the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to CorePoint stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
No appraisal or dissenters’ rights. The Board considered the fact that, under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights,
dissenters’ rights or similar rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger.
Reverse termination fee. The Board considered the fact that, if it believed Cavalier breached the merger agreement and CorePoint was unable to obtain
specific performance to compel Cavalier to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, then CorePoint’s only remedy is the right, in certain
circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement and receive a reverse termination fee of $58 million from Cavalier.
Transaction costs. The Board considered the fact that CorePoint has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in
connection with the merger, regardless of whether the merger is consummated.
 
52
Table of Contents
Potential differing interests of directors and officers. The Board considered that, aside from their interests as CorePoint stockholders, CorePoint’s
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other CorePoint stockholders
generally. See “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement.
Regulatory risk. While the Board considered the fact that CorePoint and Cavalier have determined that the filing of notification and report forms under
the HSR Act (or other antitrust laws) will not be necessary to complete the merger, the Board also considered that, at any time before or after the merger,
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, a state attorney general or a foreign competition authority
could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking
divestiture of assets of CorePoint, Cavalier or their respective affiliates, and private parties may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws under
certain circumstances, and the Board considered the risk that necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied, and the risk that the
applicable governmental agencies may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such approvals.
Other risks. The Board considered the types and nature of the risks and uncertainties set forth in CorePoint’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year
ended December 31, 2020 and the subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30,
2021 and current reports on Form 8-K under Item 1A “Risk Factors”.
While the Board considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that, overall, the potentially positive factors
outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, the Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and
fair to, and in the best interest of, CorePoint and its stockholders.
The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the
merger, but it includes the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by the Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety
of factors and the amount of information considered, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify, or
otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the Board may have
given different weights to different factors. Based on the totality of the information presented, the Board collectively reached the decision to approve and
declare advisable the merger agreement and the merger in light of the factors described above and other factors that the members of the Board felt were
appropriate.
Portions of this explanation of CorePoint’s reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and,
therefore, should be read in light of the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Pursuant to an engagement letter, CorePoint retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger.
At the meeting of the Board on November 6, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the per
share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its November 6, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated November 7, 2021, that, as of
such date, the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to CorePoint’s common stockholders in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such stockholders.

followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its

Morgan’s opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the merger, was
directed only to the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid in the merger and did not address any other aspect of the merger. J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to be paid in connection with the merger to the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of CorePoint or as to the underlying decision by CorePoint to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of CorePoint as to
how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
 
 •
 reviewed the merger agreement;
 
 •
 reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning CorePoint and the industries in which it operates;
 
 
•
 compared the financial and operating performance of CorePoint with publicly available information concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan
deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of CorePoint common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such
other companies;
 
 •
 reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of CorePoint relating to its business; and
 
 •
 performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of
its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of CorePoint with respect to certain aspects of the merger, and the
past and current business operations of CorePoint, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of CorePoint, and certain other matters
J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished
to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by CorePoint or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such
information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with CorePoint, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to
undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or
liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of CorePoint or Cavalier under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably
prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of CorePoint to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or
forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement will be consummated as described in the merger agreement. J.P. Morgan has assumed that the representations and warranties made by
CorePoint, Cavalier and Merger Sub in the merger agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to its
analysis. At the direction of the management of CorePoint for purposes of its opinion, J.P. Morgan assumed that no amounts will be paid as the IRS
Matter Incremental Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—IRS Matter” beginning on page 92). J.P.
Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax
 
54
Table of Contents
expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to CorePoint with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan has further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on
CorePoint or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.
The CorePoint Projections (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financial Projections” beginning on page 58) furnished to J.P. Morgan were
prepared by CorePoint’s management, as discussed more fully under the section entitled “The Merger—Financial Projections” beginning on page 58 of
this proxy statement. CorePoint does not publicly disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P.
Morgan’s analysis of the proposed merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These projections were based
on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of CorePoint’s management, including, without
limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary
significantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please
refer to the section entitled “The Merger—Financial Projections” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan
as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect such opinion and that J.P. Morgan does not have
any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share
merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger and J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of
any consideration paid in connection with the merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of CorePoint or as
to the underlying decision by CorePoint to engage in the merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of
any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the merger, or any class of such persons relative to the per share merger
consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. 
The terms of the merger agreement, including the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock, were
determined through arm’s length negotiations between CorePoint and Cavalier, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the
Board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the proposed merger
and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to the merger or the consideration, including the per
share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its opinion to
the Board on November 6, 2021 and in the financial analyses presented to the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion to the Board and does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by
J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of CorePoint with similar data for selected
publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P.
 
55
Table of Contents
Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged in by CorePoint. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
 
 
•
 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.
 
 
•
 Summit Hotel Properties, Inc.
 
 
•
 Chatham Lodging Trust
 
 
•
 CorePoint Lodging Inc.
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of
J.P. Morgan’s analysis, were considered in its judgment sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of CorePoint based on business sector
participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical or directly comparable to
CorePoint and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of CorePoint. The analyses necessarily involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors
that could affect the companies differently than they would affect CorePoint.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company the ratios of (a) the company’s enterprise value to the company’s
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA”) for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “EV/2019
Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA”), based on publicly available information, and (b) the company’s enterprise value to the consensus equity research
analyst estimates for the company’s Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2022 (the “EV/2022E Corporate adjusted cash
EBITDA”). Based on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected multiple reference ranges of
10.0x – 12.5x for EV/2019 Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA and 13.5x – 14.5x for EV/2022E Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA. After applying such ranges
to the CorePoint Core Portfolio’s (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Financial Projections” beginning on page 58) Corporate adjusted cash
EBITDA for CorePoint for the year ended December 31, 2019, as provided by CorePoint’s management, and the projected CorePoint Core Portfolio’s
Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA for CorePoint for the year ending December 31, 2022, respectively, the analysis indicated the following ranges of implied
per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for CorePoint common stock:
 
 
 
Implied Per Share
Equity Value
 
 
 
Low   
High  
CorePoint EV/2019 Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA
 
$11.00  
$14.50 
CorePoint EV/2022E Corporate adjusted cash EBITDA
 
$14.00  
$15.25 
The ranges of implied per share equity value for CorePoint common stock were compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of CorePoint common stock of
$11.04 as of July 13, 2021, (ii) the closing price of CorePoint common stock of $17.76 as of November 5, 2021, and (iii) the implied per share merger
consideration of $15.65 for CorePoint common stock.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity
value per share for CorePoint common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that CorePoint’s Core Portfolio is expected to generate
during fiscal years 2021E through 2025E based upon the CorePoint Projections prepared by CorePoint management (as set forth in the section entitled
“The Merger—Financial Projections” beginning on page 58, which were discussed with, and approved by, the Board for use by J.P. Morgan in
connection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for CorePoint at the end of this period by applying
perpetual growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 3.0%, based on guidance provided by CorePoint’s management, to estimates of the
 
56
Table of Contents
unlevered terminal free cash flows for the CorePoint Core Portfolio at the end of fiscal-year 2025E, as provided in the CorePoint Projections. J.P. Morgan
then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of September 30, 2021 using discount rates
ranging from 9.50% to 10.50% for CorePoint, which range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of
CorePoint. The present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and
other adjustments for CorePoint as of September 30, 2021.
Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for CorePoint common stock of
$6.75 to $10.00, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of CorePoint common stock of $11.04 as of July 13, 2021, (ii) the closing price of
CorePoint common stock of $17.76 as of November 5, 2021 and (iii) the implied per share merger consideration of $15.65 for CorePoint common stock.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P.
Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P.
Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and
these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its
opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to
create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of CorePoint. The
order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P.
Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual
analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of
the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as
described in the above summary is identical to CorePoint. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies
with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of CorePoint. The analyses necessarily
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other
factors that could affect the companies compared to CorePoint.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise CorePoint with respect to the
merger and deliver an opinion to the Board with respect to the merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and
reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with CorePoint and the industries in which it operates.
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the merger, CorePoint has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of $23.6 million, $3.0
million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon
the consummation of
 
57
Table of Contents
the merger. In addition, CorePoint has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in connection with
its services, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s
engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking
relationships with CorePoint, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have
included acting as sole bookrunner to CorePoint’s syndicated credit facility in March 2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an
agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of CorePoint, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During
the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with
The Blackstone Group LP (“Blackstone”), CorePoint’s approximately 30% stockholder, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary
compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunning manager on an offering of Blackstone debt securities in
July 2021. In addition, during the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment
banking relationships with Blackstone portfolio companies for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such
services during such period have included providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to
Blackstone portfolio companies. J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Blackstone
for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, neither J.P.
Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with Cavalier.
During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships
with portfolio companies of Cerberus Capital Management (“Cerberus”), an affiliate of Cavalier, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included providing equity underwriting and debt underwriting services to Cerberus
portfolio companies. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material
financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with Highgate Holdings (“Highgate”), an affiliate of Cavalier. During
the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from CorePoint were approximately $0.6 million,
from Blackstone and certain of Blackstone’s portfolio companies were approximately $210 million and from certain of Cerberus’s portfolio companies was
approximately $62 million. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 2% of the outstanding common stock of
CorePoint and less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of Cavalier, Cerberus, Highgate and Blackstone. In the ordinary course of their businesses,
J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other
obligations) of CorePoint, Blackstone, Cerberus, Highgate or Cavalier for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may
at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

CorePoint does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings, or other results, and forecasts for extended periods of time
are of particular concern to CorePoint due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the
discussions regarding the proposed merger, CorePoint management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2021
through 2025 (the “CorePoint Projections”) with respect to the 105 hotels which CorePoint previously identified as constituting its core hotels (the
“CorePoint Core Portfolio”). The CorePoint Projections were prepared treating CorePoint on a stand-alone basis, without giving effect to the merger
including the impact of negotiating or executing merger, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the potential
synergies that may be achieved as a result of the merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a
result of the merger agreement with Cavalier having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would
 
58Table of Contents
likely have been taken if the merger agreement with Cavalier had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in
anticipation of the merger. CorePoint management provided the CorePoint Projections to the Board for review in connection with the Board’s evaluation
of the proposed merger, and to J.P. Morgan, our financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. CorePoint management also provided the
CorePoint Projections for fiscal year 2021, and only for fiscal year 2021, to Cavalier.
The accompanying CorePoint Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the published
guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial
information, or generally accepted accounting principles, which is referred to as GAAP, but, in the view of CorePoint’s management, were prepared on a
reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best
of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of CorePoint on a stand-alone basis
as described above and subject to the assumptions and limitations described in this section. However, this information is not fact and should not be
relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
CorePoint Projections. Although CorePoint’s management believes there is a reasonable basis for the CorePoint Projections, CorePoint cautions
stockholders that future results could be materially different from the CorePoint Projections. This summary of the CorePoint Projections is not being
included in this proxy statement to influence your decision whether to vote for the merger agreement proposal, but because these CorePoint Projections
were provided to the Board, shared between CorePoint and Cavalier and provided to CorePoint’s financial advisor for purposes of considering and
evaluating the merger and the merger agreement. CorePoint’s independent registered public accounting firm has not audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the CorePoint Projections and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form
of assurance with respect thereto.
The CorePoint Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with
numerical specificity, the CorePoint Projections are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered
reasonable by CorePoint’s management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number
of reasons, including general economic conditions, competition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement under the sections entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 26 of this proxy statement. See also “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on this proxy statement. The CorePoint Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
Because the CorePoint Projections were developed for CorePoint on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the merger, they do not reflect any
dispositions of properties that may be consummated in connection with the merger, any synergies that may be realized as a result of the merger or any
changes to CorePoint’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the CorePoint
Projections will be realized, and actual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the CorePoint
Projections relate, the less predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.
The CorePoint Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that CorePoint believes are helpful in understanding its past financial
performance and future results. CorePoint management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP,
including Hotel Adjusted EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Unlevered Free Cash Flows for forecasting, budgeting, cash management and measuring
operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures.
While CorePoint believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand CorePoint’s operating
results and to analyze CorePoint’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-
GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of CorePoint’s
competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of CorePoint’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of
calculation.
 
59
Table of Contents
CorePoint has not provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in these projections to the comparable GAAP measure due to
no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measures for these measures and the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the
measures that are necessary for such reconciliation.
None of CorePoint or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ
from the CorePoint Projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the CorePoint Projections to
reflect circumstances existing after the date the CorePoint Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that
any or all of the assumptions underlying the CorePoint Projections, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities
laws, CorePoint does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the CorePoint Projections, even in the event that any or all
assumptions are shown to be in error. CorePoint has made publicly available its actual results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 on
CorePoint’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021 on CorePoint’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. None of
CorePoint or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any CorePoint stockholder or
other person regarding CorePoint’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the CorePoint Projections or that forecasted results
will be achieved. CorePoint has made no representation to Cavalier, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the CorePoint Projections.

Hotel Adjusted EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting recurring property-level expenses from total revenue. Hotel
Adjusted EBITDAre does not reflect (i) corporate level-expenses (ii) interest expense, (iii) income tax expenses, (iv) depreciation and amortization,
(v) the effect of impairment losses, (vi) net gain or loss on sale of assets and (vii) other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance.
(2)
Adjusted EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting recurring corporate-level expenses from Hotel Adjusted
EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre does not reflect (i) charges related to equity-based compensation, (ii) transaction expenses, (iii) severance and (iv)
other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance.
(3)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting from Adjusted EBITDAre, equity-based compensation
expense and capital expenditure allowances. Unlevered Free Cash Flow estimates were used by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analysis
for purposes of rending its fairness opinion to the Board.

Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",66,69
CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,"Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
You should be aware that CorePoint’s executive officers and directors, and in each case including organizations of which such person is an officer or
partner, have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CorePoint’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement. These interests are described below. For purposes of
the discussion below, CorePoint’s executive officers are President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith A. Cline; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Daniel E. Swanstrom II; and Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, Mark M. Chloupek (together with Messrs. Cline and
Swanstrom, the “named executive officers” or “NEOs”). CorePoint does not currently have any other executive officers other than the NEOs.
These material interests are summarized below:
 
 
•
 CorePoint’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under indemnification
agreements, directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and the merger agreement.
 
 
•
 Certain of CorePoint’s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation and benefits under CorePoint’s Executive
Severance Plan (as described below).
 
 
•
 The merger agreement provides for the payment of a pro-rated portion of annual bonuses for fiscal year 2022 (with performance deemed
achieved at target) for all employees eligible for an annual bonus (including the named executive officers) if closing does not occur by
January 1, 2022.
 
 
•
 The merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all CorePoint equity-based awards including Restricted Stock,
RSUs, PSUs, deferred stock units, and dividend equivalent rights associated with such awards for all employees holding such awards
(including the named executive officers).
Arrangements with Cavalier
Any CorePoint executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to Cavalier
or the surviving entity following the closing of the merger, however, may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in
cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Cavalier or the surviving entity. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation
arrangements between such persons and Cavalier and/or its affiliates have been established. Pursuant to the merger agreement, our executive officers will
serve as officers of the surviving entity immediately following the effective time until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the surviving entity’s certificate of limited partnership and limited partnership
agreement and applicable law.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, CorePoint’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification, expense
advancement and insurance arrangements. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement – Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance”
beginning on page 91 for a description of such ongoing arrangements.
Executive Severance Plan
We maintain an Executive Severance Plan in which employees of CorePoint at the level of Vice President and above (including our NEOs) participate. The
Executive Severance Plan provides for payment of severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment by CorePoint without “cause” or by
the employee for “good
 
61Table of Contents
reason” (each as defined in the Executive Severance Plan) (a “covered termination”), and enhanced severance benefits in the event of a covered
termination that occurs on or within the six-month period prior to, or within the two-year period following the first to occur of (i) a change in control (as
defined in the Executive Severance Plan, and which includes the merger) and (ii) a significant corporate event (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan
and which generally means a transaction that results in the elimination from the Company and its subsidiaries of all, or a majority of, the CorePoint’s
operating units or real property assets) (as applicable, the “CIC protected period”).
In the event a covered termination occurs within the CIC protected period, in addition to certain accrued obligations, participants are entitled to:
 
 
•
 a pro-rata bonus for the year of termination, based on target performance, payable at the time cash bonus payments are paid to other
similarly-situated employees;
 
 
•
 3.0 times (for Mr. Cline) and 2.0 times (for Messrs. Swanstrom and Chloupek) the sum of the executive’s base salary and target annual
bonus, payable in a lump sum within 60 days following the date of the executive’s termination of employment;
 
 
•
 continued health insurance coverage at substantially the same level as provided immediately prior to such termination, at CorePoint’s
expense, at the same cost as generally provided to similarly situated active Company employees for a period up 36 months for Mr. Cline and
24 months for Messrs. Swanstrom and Chloupek; and
 
 
•
 payment of, or reimbursement for, up to $10,000 in outplacement services within the three-year period following the executive’s termination
of employment.
Severance benefits payable under the Executive Severance Plan are subject to the executive’s (i) execution and non-revocation of a general release of
claims in the favor of CorePoint and (ii) continued compliance with the executive’s Non-Interference Agreement. Each NEO’s Non-Interference Agreement
includes the following restrictive covenants: non-competition covenant that applies during the employment term and for 12 months thereafter, employee
and consultant non-solicitation, employee no-hire, and business relation non-solicitation covenants that apply during the employment term and for 24
months thereafter. The Non-Interference Agreements also include a perpetual confidentiality and assignment of IP covenant, and a non-disparagement
covenant that applies during the employment term and for 24 months thereafter.
In addition to severance benefits, the Executive Severance Plan also provides that, upon the first to occur of (i) a change in control and (ii) a significant
corporate event, any unvested outstanding equity award granted to the participants under our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Company Stock Plan”)
that is not continued, converted, assumed or replaced in connection with such change in control or significant corporate event will fully vest; provided,
that, vesting for performance-based vesting awards with market performance conditions will be based on actual performance and financial performance
conditions will be based on target performance. However, as described below, pursuant to the merger agreement, performance-based awards will vest in
connection with the merger based on the greater of target or actual performance.
The Executive Severance Plan also provides that if any payments and/or benefits due to a participant (including any NEO) under the Executive Severance
Plan and/or any other arrangements will constitute “excess parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G (“Section 280G”) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), CorePoint will reduce the amount of payments under the Executive Severance Plan by the minimum amount
necessary to avoid triggering the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “280G Excise Tax”), but only if the net after-tax amount of such
payments and benefits as so reduced is greater than or equal to the net after-tax amount of such payments and benefits without such reduction.
Mr. Chloupek and CorePoint are also party to an employment agreement, which includes severance benefits. The Executive Severance Plan provides that
in the event any amount due and payable under the Executive
 
62
Table of Contents
Severance Plan is greater than and in addition to the amount due and payable under such other agreement, the participant will be entitled to such greater
amount. The enhanced change in control severance benefits payable to Mr. Chloupek under the Executive Severance Plan are generally greater than the
severance benefits provided under Mr. Chloupek’s employment agreement (as summarized below), and, accordingly, in the event Mr. Chloupek’s
employment is terminated in connection with the merger, Mr. Chloupek would be entitled to the severance benefits provided under the Executive
Severance Plan.
Mr. Chloupek’s employment agreement also provides for reimbursement by us on a “grossed up” basis for all taxes incurred in connection with all
payments or benefits provided to him upon a change in control that are determined by us to be subject to the 280G Excise Tax in an amount equal to the
lesser of (A) the aggregate amount of all excise tax payments on a “grossed up” basis, or (B) 1.25 times his then-current annual base salary.
2022 Annual Bonuses
The merger agreement provides that if closing has not occurred by January 1, 2022, then on or as soon as practicable following the closing date, a pro-
rated portion of the bonuses or short term incentives that relate to performance during CorePoint’s 2022 fiscal year will be paid to employees eligible to
receive such bonuses or incentives pursuant to terms of CorePoint’s 2022 annual bonus plans or short term incentive plans. The amount of each pro-
rated bonus will be based on the number of days that occur during the 2022 fiscal year prior to the closing (with performance goals or metrics deemed
achieved at target).
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
Under the terms of the merger agreement, all CorePoint equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (including those held by our
executive officers) will generally be subject to the following treatment:
 
 
•
 Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding share of common stock of CorePoint subject to vesting restrictions (“Restricted
Stock”), restricted stock unit (“RSU”) (other than a performance-based restricted stock unit (“PSU”)) or deferred stock unit granted under
the Company Stock Plan (each, a “Stock Unit”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become
immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Unit will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the
effective time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such Stock Unit immediately
prior to the effective time multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents
provided under the terms of any applicable Stock Unit award agreement (“dividend equivalent rights”), less applicable taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.
 
 
•
 Immediately prior to the effective time, each PSU will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof,
become immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of each such PSU will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly
after the effective time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such PSU immediately
prior to the effective time, calculated based on the greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with
the terms of such PSU, and (B) target level performance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable
unpaid dividend equivalent rights provided under the terms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less applicable taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.
Quantification of Company Equity Award
For an estimate of the amounts that would be realized by each of our named executive officers with respect to their CorePoint equity awards that are
expected to vest in connection with the merger see “Golden Parachute Compensation” section below. In addition, the estimated aggregate amount that
would be realized by CorePoint’s
 
63
Table of Contents
non-employee directors in settlement of their RSUs and deferred stock units in accordance with the merger agreement is $6,601,827.30 (calculated based
on RSUs and deferred stock units outstanding as of January 13, 2022, and assuming the effective time occurs on March 3, 2022). These amounts assume
that any time-vesting equity awards that are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to March 3, 2022 vest, but do not attempt to forecast
any additional equity grants, issuances or forfeitures that may occur prior to the closing of the merger and do not include any additional dividend rights
or dividend equivalent rights that may accrue prior to the closing of the merger. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not be
accurate on the relevant date, the actual amounts, if any, to be realized by CorePoint’s executive officers who are not named executive officers and non-
employee directors may materially differ from the amounts set forth above.
280G Mitigation Actions
CorePoint may take certain actions before the closing to mitigate the amount of potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals”
(each as defined in Section 280G) (the “280G Mitigation Actions”). As of the date of this proxy statement, the following 280G Mitigation Actions have
been taken, as further described below: (i) the acceleration of certain PSUs held by Keith Cline, Mark Chloupek, Howard Garfield, and Dan Swanstrom
(collectively, the “Covered Executives”), and (ii) the acceleration of payment of 2021 annual bonuses for the Covered Executives.
More specifically, the PSUs which were granted to each of the Covered Executives on March 25, 2020 (the “2020 PSUs”) were accelerated and settled on
December 17, 2021 (together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalent amounts), with vesting determined based on maximum performance. The
number of 2020 PSUs accelerated and settled (at maximum performance) for each of the Covered Executives was as follows: 824,610 for Keith Cline,
247,384 for Mark Chloupek, 92,357 for Howard Garfield, and 247,384 for Dan Swanstrom. The shares received by each of the Covered Executives in
connection with the acceleration and settlement of the 2020 PSUs (net of shares withheld for tax withholding purposes) are reflected in the table set forth
in the “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” section below. Payment of annual bonuses under the CorePoint Operating
Partnership L.P. Section 16 Short Term Incentive Plan for the performance period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Bonuses”) for
each of the Covered Executives was also accelerated. Such bonuses were paid on December 23, 2021 in connection with the 280G Mitigation Actions, and
were otherwise expected to be paid in the ordinary course on or around January 31, 2022. The amount of the 2021 Bonuses paid to each of the Covered
Executives was as follows: $1,591,350 for Keith Cline, $824,000 for Mark Chloupek, $336,000 for Howard Garfield, and $950,000 for Dan Swanstrom. Each
Covered Executive executed a repayment agreement that requires the executive to repay the accelerated compensation amounts if the executive
voluntarily resigns prior to the earlier of the closing of the merger and the originally scheduled vesting, payment or settlement date (as applicable).
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates
to, the merger that will or may become payable to each named executive officer of CorePoint in connection with the merger. For additional details
regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on several assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the effective
date of the merger, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may
occur prior to completion of the merger. The calculations in the table below do not include amounts the named executive officers were already entitled to
receive or were vested in as of January 13, 2022. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity or cash award grants,
issuances or forfeitures that may occur, or future dividend
 
64
Table of Contents
equivalents that may be accrued, prior to the closing of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the per share value of CorePoint common
stock was based on the per share merger consideration ($15.65 per share) and the following assumptions were used:
 
 
•
 the effective date of the merger is March 3, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the
disclosure in this section;
 
 
•
 any time-vesting equity awards that are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to March 3, 2022 will vest;
 
 
•
 the employment of each named executive officer will have been terminated by Cavalier or an affiliate without “cause” or by the executive for
“good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Executive Severance Plan or, in the case of Mr. Chloupek, as defined in his employment
agreement) (a “qualifying termination”) immediately following the assumed date of closing specified above;
 
 
•
 each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remains unchanged from those in place as of January 13, 2022; and
 
 
•
 each named executive officer holds only those equity awards that were outstanding and unvested on January 13, 2022 and PSUs will vest at
maximum level of performance (i.e., 175% of target performance).
As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described
in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
For purposes of this discussion, “single-trigger” refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the closing, and “double-trigger” refers to benefits that
arise as a result of the closing accompanied by a qualifying termination immediately following the closing.

Cash. The amount set forth in this column include the following cash severance payments and benefits, as provided for under the Executive
Severance Plan described above. The cash severance payments and benefits include the following: (i) 3.0 times (for Mr. Cline) and 2.0 times (for
Messrs. Chloupek and Swanstrom) the sum of the executive’s annual base salary and target annual bonus ($4,774,050 for Mr. Cline, $1,900,000 for
Mr. Swanstrom, and $1,648,000 for Mr. Chloupek), and (ii) a prorated portion of the executive’s target annual bonus ($198,919 for Mr. Cline, $118,750
for Mr. Swanstrom, and $103,000 for Mr. Chloupek) (the “Pro-Rated Severance Bonus”). The cash severance payments and benefits included in this
column are “double-trigger” payments. However, as described in “2022 Annual Bonuses” section above, pursuant to the merger agreement, if
closing has not occurred by January 1, 2022, a pro-rated portion of the executive’s annual bonus with respect to performance during the 2022 fiscal
year (“Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus”) will be paid at or shortly following the closing, based on the number of days that occurs during the 2022
fiscal year prior to the closing (with performance goals or metrics deemed achieved at target). Such payment constitutes a “single-trigger” payment.
Assuming a closing date of March 3, 2022, the amount of the Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus is $132,976 for Keith Cline, $79,384 for Dan Swanstrom,
and $68,855 for Mark Chloupek. To the extent an executive receives a Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus, the Pro-Rated Severance Bonus Amount
payable upon a subsequent qualifying termination under the Executive Severance Plan would be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid
duplication of payment. Accordingly, we did not include the amount of the Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus in addition to the Pro-Rated Severance
Bonus amount for purposes of calculating the total amount included in the “Cash” column for each executive, as this would result in double
counting.

Perquisites and Benefits. Amounts in this column represent (i) 36 months for Mr. Cline and 24 months for each of Messrs. Swanstrom and Chloupek
of continued healthcare coverage ($107,523 for Mr. Cline, $27,571 for Mr. Swanstrom and $71,682 for Mr. Chloupek), and (ii) the maximum value of
outplacement services each NEO may receive upon a qualifying termination, which is $10,000, in each case as provided under the Executive
Severance Plan. The amount payable to each named executive officer is a “double-trigger” payment, which means the amount will become payable
only upon a qualifying termination of employment following the effective time.
(4)
Tax Reimbursement. Certain payments, awards, benefits or distributions made to Mr. Chloupek in connection with the merger could potentially be
subject to the excise tax imposed on “excess parachute payments” (as defined for purposes of 280G) by the Code (“Section 280G Excise Taxes”).
Mr. Chloupek’s employment agreement provides that Mr. Chloupek is entitled to a one-time reimbursement for all such 280G Excise Taxes (or, if less,
1.25 times his then-current annual base salary). This reimbursement amount would constitute a “single-trigger” payment. However, based on a
Section 280G analysis prepared by the Company’s advisors (which takes into account the effect of the 280G Mitigation Actions taken (as described
above)), it is not anticipated that Mr. Chloupek will receive “excess parachute payments” in connection with the merger, and accordingly Mr.
Chloupek will not be subject to an excise tax on any such amounts. Accordingly, we included $0 for the estimated value of Mr. Chloupek’s
reimbursement for Section 280G Excise Taxes.
Financing of the Merger",69,74
CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consolidation, repay or
redeem any indebtedness to be repaid or redeemed by CorePoint and its subsidiaries pursuant to the merger agreement and pay all fees, costs and
expenses required to be paid by Cavalier or Merger Sub at or prior to the closing of the merger in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement), which would be approximately $1.7 billion, will be funded through a combination of the following:
 
 
•
 equity commitments by Cerberus Credit (as defined below) and the Highgate Sponsors (as defined below) in an aggregate amount up to
$658,138,203, subject to increase and reduction in certain circumstances, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Cerberus
Equity Commitment Letter (as defined below) and the Highgate Equity Commitment Letter (as defined below), respectively, as further
described in the section entitled “—Equity Financing” beginning on page 67; and
 
 
•
 debt financing commitments from the debt commitment parties (as defined below) consisting of a mortgage and/or mezzanine loan facility in
an amount up to, subject to certain limitations, $1,030,000,000, as further described in the section entitled “—Debt Financing” beginning on
page 69.
Each of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors are providing limited guaranties, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
respective limited guaranties, guaranteeing the payment and
 
66Table of Contents
performance of Cavalier of its parent termination fee obligations and certain other payment obligations, as further described in the section entitled
“The Merger—Financing of the Merger —Limited Guaranties” beginning on page 68.
The consummation of the merger is not conditioned upon Cavalier obtaining the proceeds of any financing.
Equity Financing
Cavalier is a party to the equity commitment letter, by and among CRE Credit Holdco II, LP (“Cerberus Credit”) and Cavalier (the “Cerberus Equity
Commitment Letter”) and the equity commitment letter, by and among Mahmood Khimji and Mehdi Khimji (collectively with Mahmood Khimji, the
“Highgate Sponsors”; the Highgate Sponsors and Cerberus Credit, each an “Investor”) and Cavalier (the “Highgate Equity Commitment Letter”),
pursuant to which (i) Cerberus Credit has committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Cerberus Equity Commitment Letter, to make
available to Cavalier up to $297,456,742 of equity financing, subject to increase and reduction in certain circumstances, and (ii) the Highgate Sponsors
have committed, upon the terms upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Highgate Equity Commitment Letter, to make available to Cavalier up
to $360,681,461 of equity financing, subject to increase and reduction in certain circumstances.
Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors, subject to the conditions set forth in the respective equity commitment letters, commit to cause Cavalier to
be capitalized with an aggregate of $297,456,742 in cash, in the case of Cerberus Credit, and $360,681,461 in cash, in the case of the Highgate Sponsors, all
of which will be used by Cavalier to fund, at the closing, together with the proceeds of the debt financing, the sum of (i) the aggregate per share merger
consideration pursuant to the merger agreement, (ii) any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Cavalier or the surviving entity in connection
with the merger and the financing, (iii) any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of CorePoint or its subsidiaries contemplated by the merger
agreement or the financing commitments, (iv) any amounts payable, if any, to the holders of shares of CorePoint preferred stock pursuant to the change
of control offer contemplated by the merger agreement and/or (v) any other payment obligations of Cavalier and the surviving entity contemplated under
the merger agreement; provided that, in each case, the respective equity commitments shall be increased, subject to the terms of the applicable equity
commitment letter, if CorePoint is required to redeem any shares of CorePoint preferred stock pursuant to the change of control offer. In the event that
Cavalier does not require Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors to fund all of the aggregate amount of the equity commitments in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then the amount of each equity commitment to be funded will be reduced pursuant
to the terms of the applicable equity commitment letter. The obligations of each of the Highgate Sponsors pursuant to the Highgate Equity Commitment
Letter will be joint and several.
The obligation of each of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors to fund its equity commitment is subject to the terms and conditions and limitations
set forth in the merger agreement and the applicable equity commitment letter, which conditions include: (i) the execution and delivery of the merger
agreement, (ii) the satisfaction or irrevocable waiver by Cavalier of all of Cavalier’s conditions to close set forth in the closing conditions section of the
merger agreement (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or irrevocable
waiver by Cavalier of such conditions at the closing), (iii) no party having validly terminated the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, (iv) the
financing provided for by the debt financing commitments (or, if applicable, the alternative financing pursuant to the merger agreement) has been funded
or will be funded at the closing in accordance with the terms thereof if the equity financing is funded at the closing, (v) the concurrent consummation of
the closing in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (vi) the substantially simultaneous funding by the other Investor of the amount
required to be funded pursuant to its respective equity commitment letter.
Cerberus Credit’s and the Highgate Sponsors’ obligation to fund their respective equity commitments will terminate automatically and immediately upon
the earliest to occur of (a) the consummation of the closing of the
 
67
Table of Contents
merger, (b) the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, and (c) the assertion by CorePoint or any of its controlled affiliates
in any litigation or other proceeding of any claim or purported claim under (i) the equity commitment letter of the Investor or the other Investor, (ii) the
limited guaranty of the Investor or the other Investor, or (iii) otherwise against the Investor, other Investor, Cavalier, or certain other parties in connection
with the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the equity commitment letters or the merger agreement, in each case, other than a
claim against (i) any Investor to specifically enforce the provisions of the equity commitment letters as described in the remedies and specific
performance provisions therein, (ii) Cavalier or Merger Sub under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, (iii) any claim
to enforce, or for damages under, the applicable confidentiality agreement, and (iv) any claim under the section describing the Investor’s or the other
Investor’s guaranty obligations under the respective limited guaranty.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Cavalier will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the equity financing.
CorePoint has the right to enforce Cavalier’s right to cause the equity financing to be funded by the Investors as a third party beneficiary solely to the
extent CorePoint is entitled to specific performance under the merger agreement to enforce Cavalier’s right to cause the equity financing to be funded (see
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Specific Performance” beginning on page 100).
Limited Guaranties
CorePoint is a party to the limited guaranty, by and between Cerberus Credit and CorePoint (the “Cerberus Limited Guaranty”) and the limited guaranty,
by and among the Highgate Sponsors and CorePoint (the “Highgate Limited Guaranty”). Each of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the respective limited guaranty, guarantees the observance, performance and discharge of 30%, in the
case of the Highgate Sponsors, and 70%, in the case of Cerberus Credit, of (a) the payment obligations of Cavalier with respect to the parent termination
fee (or, without duplication, any damages incurred by CorePoint due to Cavalier’s breach of the merger agreement up to, but not exceeding, an amount (in
the aggregate) equal to the parent termination fee), (b) the payment obligations of Cavalier under the provision of the merger agreement relating to
reimbursement of financing related expenses, (c) the payment obligations of Cavalier under the provision of the merger agreement relating to
reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuing payment of termination fees and (d) the payment obligations of Cavalier under the provisions of the merger
agreement relating to antitrust filings and proxy statement preparation fees, in each case, subject to the terms and limitations of the merger agreement. In
no event will the aggregate liability under the respective limited guaranty exceed 30%, in the case of the Highgate Sponsors, and 70%, in the case of
Cerberus Credit, of the sum of (i) the parent termination fee and (ii) the amount of all costs and expenses, if any, described in clauses (b) – (d) above and
the amount of all costs and expenses, if any, under the litigation reimbursement provision of the respective limited guaranty (for purposes of this clause
(ii), with respect to each limited guaranty, any such costs and expenses will not exceed, in any event, $5,000,000 in the aggregate). The obligations of each
of the Highgate Sponsors pursuant to the Highgate Limited Guaranty will be joint and several.
The obligations and liabilities of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors under the respective limited guaranty will terminate as of the earliest to
occur of: (i) the consummation of the closing following payment by Cavalier of the amounts necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, (ii) payment of 70%, in the case of Cerberus Credit, and 30%, in the case of the Highgate Sponsors, of the parent termination fee to
CorePoint pursuant to the merger agreement by Cerberus Credit or the Highgate Sponsors, as applicable, and (iii) the 120th day after any valid written
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, unless, in the case of clause (iii), CorePoint has taken certain actions with respect to
claims under the respective limit guaranty prior to such 120th day, in which case the applicable limited guaranty would terminate upon the earlier of (x) the
final, non-appealable resolution of such claim or litigation or (y) written agreement
 
68
Table of Contents
between Cerberus Credit or the Highgate Sponsor, as applicable, and CorePoint resolving such claim, and in each case the satisfaction by Cerberus Credit
or the Highgate Sponsors, as applicable, of the obligations as so finally determined or agreed upon.
Debt Financing
In connection with the merger, Cavalier (through its subsidiary Merger Sub) obtained a commitment letter, dated November 6, 2021 (as amended, the “debt
commitment letter”), from Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch and Bank of Montreal (collectively, the “debt commitment parties” or “lender”) to
provide, severally but not jointly, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter, acquisition debt financing in an aggregate
amount of up to, subject to certain limitations, $1.030 billion, consisting of mortgage and/or mezzanine loans (the “debt financing”).
The proceeds of the debt financing will be used to (i) pay a portion of the consideration due under the merger agreement and indirectly to acquire the
portfolio consisting of a number of hotel properties described in the debt commitment letter (collectively or individually, as the context requires, the
“Property”), (ii) fund any required upfront reserves (if any) and (iii) pay approved costs and expenses in connection with the debt financing.
The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter are subject to a number of conditions,
including:
 
 
•
 full satisfaction (or waiver by lender, in its sole discretion) of the terms and conditions expressly set forth in the debt commitment letter
(including, without limitation, the conditions set forth in a schedule to the term sheet attached to the debt commitment letter (the “term
sheet”), provided that the failure to satisfy any such conditions set forth in the term sheet shall not give rise to lender’s right to terminate
the debt commitment letter other than with respect to the KYC Condition (as defined below), and lender’s only right with respect to any
such failure to satisfy any such conditions set forth in the term sheet shall be to create a “special reserve”, in each case pursuant to the
terms of the debt commitment letter (the provisions in the debt commitment letter describing the limitations and rights related to the special
reserve, the “special reserve provisions”)), subject to Cerberus Institutional Real Estate Partners V, L.P.’s (“Sponsor”) ability to cure certain
breaches in a manner satisfactory to lender in lender’s good faith determination;
 
 
•
 delivery to lender of the items and completion by lender of the due diligence described in a schedule to the term sheet, but subject to the

Cavalier is required under the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the debt financing. In the event that any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter or to the extent that Cavalier reasonably believes in good faith that it will not have funds available
that are sufficient to enable it to fund the financing uses in full, Cavalier will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain alternative financing sufficient to
pay all amounts required to be paid to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and pay all financing uses and (ii) obtain new
financing commitment letter(s) that would provide for debt financing (A) on terms and conditions not less beneficial to Cavalier than those contemplated
in the debt commitment letter and (B) that would not involve (or expand upon) any conditions to funding of the debt financing that are more onerous than
the conditions contained in the debt commitment letter. The definitive documentation governing the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment
letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.",74,78

As of the date of this definitive proxy statement, three lawsuits challenging the merger have been filed against CorePoint and the Board. The first lawsuit,
captioned Wang v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00026, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 3,
2022. The second lawsuit, captioned Whitfield v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00147, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York on January 6, 2022. The third lawsuit, captioned Gorrell v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00146, was filed in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of New York on January 10, 2022. The complaints filed in these lawsuits allege, among other things, that the defendants caused a
materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement to be filed with the SEC in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
CorePoint and the Board believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

Your receipt of the merger consideration for your shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
taxable sale of your common stock (except in the case of certain non-U.S. stockholders noted below). Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you
will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the merger consideration you receive and your adjusted
tax basis in your shares. However, under certain circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger consideration under applicable
tax laws, and we intend to withhold a portion of the merger consideration paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders (who could be treated as having
effectively connected income subject to U.S. federal income tax) to the extent required under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act
(“FIRPTA”). Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. We encourage
you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you. For further discussion, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax

We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Under Section 3-202 of the MGCL, because our common stock was listed on the NYSE on the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, our common stockholders who object to the merger do not have any
appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. In addition, holders of our common stock may
not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in
connection with the merger because, as permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless
our Board determines that the rights apply. Our Board has made no such determination. However, our common stockholders can vote against the merger

The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement.
Factual disclosures about CorePoint contained in this proxy statement or in CorePoint’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or
modify the factual disclosures about CorePoint contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary. The representations, warranties and
covenants made in the merger agreement by CorePoint, Cavalier and Merger Sub were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by
CorePoint, Cavalier and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations
and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties
were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close
the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the merger agreement, and were not intended by the parties to the merger agreement to be a characterization of the actual state of
facts or condition of CorePoint, Cavalier or Merger Sub, except as expressly stated in the merger agreement. The representations and warranties may also
be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC,
and in some cases were qualified by disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this

Upon the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, CorePoint will merge with and into Merger Sub and the separate corporate
existence of CorePoint will cease, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity. At the effective time, the limited partnership agreement of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will, by virtue of the merger, be the limited partnership agreement of the surviving entity until
thereafter amended. At the effective time, the certificate of limited partnership of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will, by
virtue of the merger, be the certificate of limited partnership of the surviving entity until thereafter amended. Except as otherwise determined by Cavalier in
its sole discretion, from and after the effective time, the officers of CorePoint immediately before the effective time will be the initial officers of the

removal, in accordance with the surviving entity’s certificate of limited partnership and limited partnership agreement and applicable law.
Effect of the Merger on CorePoint Common Stock and Preferred Stock
At the effective time, each share of CorePoint common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of common
stock owned by CorePoint, Cavalier or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time and not held on behalf of third parties (“cancelled shares”) and
converted shares (as defined below) or Restricted Stock (as defined below)) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. From and
after the effective time, such CorePoint common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, and will cease to exist, and each
holder of certificates or book-entry shares, which immediately prior to the effective time represented such CorePoint common stock, will cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of such certificates or book-entry shares, the merger consideration.
At the effective time, any shares of CorePoint common stock that are cancelled shares will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist,
and no consideration or payment will be delivered in exchange for such shares. At the effective time, any shares of CorePoint common stock owned by
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CorePoint or Cavalier (other than Merger Sub) (“converted shares”) will automatically be converted into
such number of limited partnership units of the surviving entity such that the ownership percentage of each owner of converted shares in the surviving
entity immediately after the effective time is the same as such subsidiary’s ownership percentage in CorePoint immediately prior to the effective time.
At the effective time, each share of CorePoint preferred stock will automatically be converted into a unit of a newly created series of preferred limited
partnership interests of Merger Sub with substantially identical powers, preferences, privileges, and rights as the CorePoint preferred stock and, upon
such conversion, the CorePoint preferred stock will automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist.
The merger consideration or the new Merger Sub preferred limited partnership interests, as applicable, will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split), combination, stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction occurring on or after November 6, 2021 and prior to the effective time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the merger agreement, nothing in the merger agreement shall prohibit CorePoint or any of its
subsidiaries, in consultation with Cavalier, from taking any action, at any time or from time to time, that in the reasonable judgment of the Board, upon
advice of counsel, is reasonably necessary for any of CorePoint or any of its subsidiaries to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the effective time, including making dividend or
other distribution payments to stockholders of CorePoint (in accordance with the section of the merger agreement permitting dividends related to
maintaining CorePoint’s qualification as a REIT) or otherwise.
The merger agreement also provides that, except as may be expressly required by the merger agreement and certain other ancillary agreements or required
by applicable law, during the period from November 6, 2021 to effective time (or the date, if any, on which the merger agreement is terminated by its terms),
each of Cavalier and Merger Sub agrees, that from November 6, 2021 until the earlier of the effective time and the valid termination of the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms, it shall not and Cavalier shall cause each member of the Cavalier Group (as defined below) not to, directly or
indirectly, take any action (including any action with respect to a third party) that would, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
or their respective ability to satisfy their obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing contained in the merger agreement gives Cavalier or Merger Sub the right to control or direct CorePoint’s or its
subsidiaries’ operations prior to the effective time and nothing contained in the merger agreement gives CorePoint the right to control or direct Cavalier’s,
Merger Sub’s or their respective subsidiaries’ operations prior to the effective time.",86,90

Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if an
Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a material breach of the merger agreement is received by CorePoint, and the Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal would constitute a Superior
Proposal, the Board may, if the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable law, (x) effect a Change of Recommendation
and/or (y) terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that CorePoint pays to Cavalier any termination payment required to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement at
or prior to the time of such termination (it being understood that such termination will not be effective until such termination fee is paid);
provided further, that:
 
 
•
 CorePoint will not be entitled to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with its terms
unless (i) CorePoint delivers to Cavalier a written notice advising Cavalier that the Board intends to take such action and containing
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Board (including the identity
of the party making such Superior Proposal and a written summary of any additional material terms and conditions communicated
orally), and shall include with such notice unredacted copies of the proposed transaction agreement (if any) and copies of any other
documents evidencing or specifying the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the fourth business day immediately following the day on which CorePoint delivered the such notice;
 
 
•
 after giving such notice and prior to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, CorePoint shall negotiate in good faith
with Cavalier (to the extent requested by Cavalier), to make such revisions to the terms of the merger agreement as would cause such
Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal; and
 
 
•
 at the end of the notice period, prior to and as a condition to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Board shall
take into account in good faith any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Cavalier in response to the
notice by CorePoint and any other information offered by Cavalier in response to the notice by CorePoint, and shall have determined
in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, if such changes offered in writing by Cavalier (if any) were to be given effect. Any revision,
amendment, update or supplement to the consideration or any other material terms of any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a
new Acquisition Proposal and require a new notice by CorePoint and notice period of two business days.
Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board may
effect a Change of Recommendation if (x) an Intervening Event has occurred, and (y) prior to taking such action, the Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), that failure to take such action in response to such Intervening Event would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable law; provided, however, that prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation, (A) CorePoint shall give notice to Cavalier four business days in advance, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description
of such Intervening Event, (B) after giving such notice and prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation, CorePoint shall negotiate in good faith with
Cavalier (to the extent requested by Cavalier), to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (C) at the end of the notice period, prior to and
as a condition to effecting a Change of Recommendation, the Board shall take into account in good faith any changes to the terms of the merger
agreement proposed in writing by Cavalier in response to the notice by CorePoint and any other information offered by Cavalier in response to the notice
by CorePoint, and shall have determined in good faith after
 
84
Table of Contents
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that (I) such Intervening Event remains in effect and (II) the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under
applicable law if such changes proposed in writing by Cavalier (if any) were to be given effect.
CorePoint agrees that immediately following November 6, 2021, it shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) give notice to Cavalier of the receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, such
proposal, including proposed agreements received by CorePoint relating to such Acquisition Proposal, and thereafter shall keep Cavalier informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments or proposed amendments to the
material terms thereof) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and promptly provide (and in any event within 24 hours) to Cavalier any
material nonpublic information concerning CorePoint provided to any other person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously
provided to Cavalier. CorePoint shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after such determination) inform Cavalier in writing if CorePoint
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement. Unless the merger agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to its terms, CorePoint shall not take any action to exempt any
person other than Cavalier from the restrictions on “business combinations” contained in any applicable takeover law or in the organizational documents
of the CorePoint, or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. CorePoint agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement with
any person which directly or indirectly prohibits CorePoint from providing any information to Cavalier in accordance with, or otherwise complying with,
the merger agreement.
CorePoint agrees that immediately following November 6, 2021, it shall (i) cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than
Cavalier and Merger Sub and their respective representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, in each case that exist as of November 6, 2021,
(ii) promptly request each person (other than the Cavalier and Merger Sub and their respective representatives) that has prior to November 6, 2021
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring CorePoint to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished to such person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries prior to November 6, 2021 and (iii) promptly terminate all physical and electronic
data access previously granted to such persons. CorePoint shall enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without Cavalier’s prior written consent, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement; provided that, if the Board determines in good faith after
consultation with the CorePoint’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular standstill provision would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable law, CorePoint may, waive such standstill solely to the extent necessary to permit the applicable
person (if it has not been solicited in material violation of the merger agreement) to make, on a confidential basis to the Board, an Acquisition Proposal,
conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Cavalier, in each case as contemplated by the merger agreement so
long as CorePoint promptly notifies Cavalier thereof after granting any such waiver.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means:
 
 
•
 any proposal or offer from any person or group of persons (other than Cavalier or its respective affiliates) relating to (A) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by any person or group of a business that
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of the
consolidated total assets (it being understood that total assets include equity securities of subsidiaries of CorePoint) of CorePoint
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, resulting in any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of
CorePoint, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 20% or
more of the total voting power of the equity
 
85
Table of Contents
 
securities of CorePoint, or (D) any merger (including a reverse merger in which CorePoint is the surviving entity), reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
CorePoint (or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of CorePoint whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or
fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of the consolidated total assets of CorePoint and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole); in each case, except the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided that any proposal or offer to the
extent related to any purchase of assets, properties or businesses to be divested or held separate in accordance with the merger
agreement shall not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “Intervening Event” means:
 
 
•
 any material event, development, change, effect or occurrence (but specifically excluding any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal) that was not known and was not reasonably foreseeable by the Board on November 6, 2021 (or, if known or reasonably
foreseeable, the consequences of which were not known and were not reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of November 6, 2021),
which becomes known to CorePoint or the Board after November 6, 2021; provided that in no event shall the following events,
changes or developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof or (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of any securities of CorePoint or
its subsidiaries or any change in credit rating or the fact that CorePoint meets or exceeds internal or published estimates, projections,
forecasts or predictions for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes shall not be excluded by this clause (B)).
For purposes of the merger agreement, “Superior Proposal” means:
 
 
•
 a bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal (except that the references in the definition thereof to “20% or more” shall be deemed to
be references to “80% or more”), that the Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), in good
faith determines (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and (y) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable (including from a financial point of view) to the stockholders of CorePoint than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case after taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in good
faith by the Board, including legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and stockholder
approval requirements, the sources, availability and terms of any financing, financing market conditions and the existence of any

From and after November 6, 2021 and prior to the effective time, CorePoint shall be permitted to declare and pay a dividend to its stockholders distributing

discussion of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, see “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 72. A copy of the merger agreement is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. See also “The Merger” beginning on page 34.
The Board unanimously has determined that it is in the best interest of CorePoint stockholders to enter into the merger agreement and has approved the
merger agreement and declared the merger advisable.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock. If you
abstain, or if you fail to vote (or submit voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, in the case of “street name” shares), it will have the
same effect as if you vote “AGAINST” the approval of the merger agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

(PROPOSAL 2)
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, CorePoint is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote
on the compensation that will be paid or may become payable to the named executive officers of CorePoint in connection with the merger, the value of
which is set forth in the table in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden
Parachute Compensation” on page 64. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachute,” is referred to in this proxy statement as the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, CorePoint is asking its stockholders to vote on
the adoption of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to CorePoint’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, as
disclosed under “The Merger—Interests of CorePoint’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation”, the
associated footnotes and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal,
and vice versa. Because the vote to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is only advisory in nature, it will not be
binding on CorePoint, Cavalier, Merger Sub, or the surviving entity. Because CorePoint is contractually obligated to make the potential merger-related
payments to the executive officers, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is
approved and the closing occurs and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast on the matter.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal because such shares are not deemed “votes cast” under Maryland law. Assuming a quorum is present, if you hold your shares
in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock will have no effect
on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. 
The Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.

proposals. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the
adjournment proposal. CorePoint does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal has been approved at the special meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the merger agreement, CorePoint may adjourn or postpone the special meeting without Cavalier’s consent only in
certain specified circumstances as described further under “The Merger Agreement—Company Stockholder Meeting and Related Actions” beginning on
page 87.
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter. Assuming a quorum is present at the
special meeting, abstentions will no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal because such shares are not deemed “votes cast” under
Maryland law. Assuming a quorum is present, if you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on
how to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",114,117
CorePoint Lodging Inc._20220114_DEFM14A_19776758_4365965.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of our common stock whose shares are
surrendered in the merger in exchange for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement.
This discussion is based upon the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations promulgated under the Code, referred to as the “Treasury Regulations,” judicial decisions and published administrative rulings, all as
currently in effect and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements
and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service of the
United States (the “IRS”) concerning our tax treatment or the tax treatment of the merger, and the statements in this proxy statement are not binding on
the IRS or any court. We can provide no assurance that the tax consequences contained in this discussion will not be challenged by the IRS, or if
challenged, will be sustained by a court.
This discussion does not address (i) U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes, (ii) state, local or non-U.S. taxes or (iii) tax reporting requirements, in each
case, as applicable to the merger. This summary assumes that shares of our common stock are held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of
their personal investment or tax circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders
that are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, including, for example:
 
 
•
 financial institutions;
 
 
•
 tax-exempt organizations;
 
 
•
 pass-through entities (such as entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes); persons acting as nominees or
otherwise not as beneficial owners;
 
 
•
 insurance companies;
 
 
•
 broker-dealers;
 
 
•
 dealers in securities or currencies;
 
 
•
 traders in securities that elect to use a mark to market method of accounting;
 
 
•
 persons that hold shares of our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale, conversion transaction, or other integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 
 
•
 regulated investment companies;
 
 
•
 real estate investment trusts (“REITs”);
 
 
•
 certain U.S. expatriates;
 
 
•
 non-U.S. governments;
 
 
•
 non-U.S. holders (as defined below) who own or who have owned (actually or constructively) more than 10% of shares of any class of our
stock (except to the extent specifically set forth below);
 
 
•
 U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 
 
•
 holders that are subject to “applicable financial statement rules” under Section 451(b) of the Code;
 
 
•
 persons who acquired shares of our common stock through the exercise of stock options or otherwise in connection with compensation;
 
 
•
 “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax; and
 
109Table of Contents
 
•
 persons who do not hold shares of our common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is:
 
 
•
 an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
 
•
 a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
 
•
 an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 
 
•
 a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons (as defined in
the Code) have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in place under the applicable Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a United States person.
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not a U.S. holder.
If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our stock, the tax treatment
of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any partnership or other entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the partners in such partnership (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), should consult their tax advisors.
This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax considerations is not binding on the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or
that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any described herein.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RULES APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER, HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF SHARES OF OUR STOCK, AND TO
REITS GENERALLY ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX. HOLDERS OF OUR STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S.
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS, IN
LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
Tax Treatment of the Merger
The merger of CorePoint with and into Merger Sub will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable sale by CorePoint of all of its assets to
Merger Sub in return for the aggregate merger consideration and the new Merger Sub preferred limited partnership interests and the assumption of
CorePoint’s liabilities, followed by the distribution of such aggregate merger consideration and the new Merger Sub preferred limited partnership interests
under Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. We will be deemed to have distributed the merger consideration to our stockholders in connection with
the deemed liquidation. The liquidating distribution will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the dividend paid deduction to the extent of our earnings
and profits and thus will be sufficient to satisfy our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income for the taxable year of the merger.
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of our Common Stock
General. The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for their shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal
to the difference between:
 
 
•
 the amount of cash received in exchange for their shares of our common stock; and
 
 
•
 the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares of our common stock.
 
110
Table of Contents
Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares of stock, with a block consisting of shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction. Assuming that the shares constitute capital assets in the hands of the U.S. holder, this gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the merger the stock has been held for more than one year. An individual U.S. holder will be subject
to tax on net capital gain at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20% (under current law, which as noted below may change and which change may
have a retroactive effective date). In addition, a 3.8% Medicare unearned contribution tax will apply to all or a portion of the gain recognized by
individuals, trusts and estates whose income exceeds certain threshold levels. Capital gains of corporate U.S. holders generally are taxable at the regular
tax rates applicable to corporations. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in the exchange is subject to limitations under the Code. In addition, the
IRS has the authority to prescribe, but has not yet prescribed, regulations that would apply a tax rate of 25% to a portion of capital gain realized by a non-
corporate stockholder on the sale of REIT stock that would correspond to the REIT’s “unrecaptured Section 1250 gain.”
Special Rule for U.S. Holders Who Have Held Shares of Our Common Stock Less than Six Months. A U.S. holder who has held shares of our common
stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of Section 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who
recognizes a loss on the exchange of our common stock in the merger, will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital
gain dividends received from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital gains, with respect to such common stock.
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of our Common Stock
General. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock will depend on various factors, including
whether the receipt of the merger consideration is treated as a distribution from us to our stockholders that is attributable to gain from the sale of “United
States real property interests.” The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to take the position that under current law, unless an exception
applies, a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT (including the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of
our common stock in the merger, which as noted, will be treated as a deemed liquidation of CorePoint for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally
subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to the extent attributable to gain from the sale of United States real property interests.
Accordingly, we intend at present to take the position that the merger consideration received in exchange for shares of our common stock in the merger
will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject to the 10% Exception (as discussed in more detail below). In general, the provisions
governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of REIT stock by non-
U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these provisions.
Distribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests. As noted above, we intend at present to take the position that the merger
consideration received in exchange for shares of our common stock in the merger will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55. 
To the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the 10% Exception described in the next paragraph below does not apply, the cash
received by a non-U.S. holder in the merger is treated as a distribution attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our United States real
property interests (which we expect to be a substantial portion of such cash). Such amount will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S.
trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be
subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or 20% to the extent
provided in the Treasury Regulations) of any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS.

Table of Contents
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if our common shares are considered “regularly traded” (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations) on
an established securities market located in the United States (and the non-U.S. holder did not hold more than 10% of such class of stock at any time
during the one year period ending on the date of the merger, which we refer to as the “10% Exception”), the tax treatment and consequences described
above would not apply, and non-U.S. holders would instead be subject to the rules described below under “— Taxable Sale of Shares of our Common
Stock.” We believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the effective time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established
securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding tax consequences of the merger to them.
Taxable Sale of Shares of our Common Stock. If both (A) the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 were not to apply to a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of
merger consideration in the merger (and the receipt of merger consideration were instead considered a sale of our common stock), and (B) either (1) the
“publicly traded exception” (as described below) applies or (2) we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” (as described below), then
non-U.S. holders should not be subject to tax on the disposition of common stock unless: (a) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if an applicable income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment
maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States; or (b) the non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met.
The “publicly traded exception” applies to a non-U.S. holder if our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by the applicable Treasury
Regulations, and the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of our common stock at all times during the 5-year period ending on the merger date. We
believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the effective time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities
market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.
Assuming we qualify as a REIT, we will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger if non-U.S. holders held
directly or indirectly less than 50% in value of shares of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger. While we believe that we
have been and currently are domestically controlled as of the date of this proxy statement, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of our
stock has been or will be sufficient for us to qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger.
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or, if an applicable income tax treaty
applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to the 30%
branch profits tax on such effectively connected gain described above.
A non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale and who meets certain other
requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain recognized on the sale, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. In addition, the non-
U.S. holder may be subject to applicable alternative minimum taxes.
If a non-U.S. holder’s common stock constitutes a United States real property interest under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder on a sale of
such stock will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder.
Income Tax Treaties. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able
to mitigate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisor regarding possible relief under an applicable income tax treaty.

U.S. Withholding Tax. As described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of the merger consideration by a non-U.S. holder will be treated as a
sale or exchange of shares of our common stock (if Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from us that is attributable to gain from the deemed
sale of our United States real property interests in the merger (if Notice 2007-55 does apply and the holder does not qualify for the 10% Exception
described above). Accordingly, we intend to withhold U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 21%, or the then-applicable rate if different (or 20%, or the then-
applicable rate if different, to the extent provided in the applicable Treasury Regulations) from the portion of the merger consideration that is, or is treated
as, attributable to gain from the sale of United States real property interests and paid to a non-U.S. holder unless such holder qualifies for the 10%
Exception described above.
A non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount withheld
pursuant to FIRPTA, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisor
regarding tax and withholding considerations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, and information reporting, may apply to the merger consideration received in the merger. Backup
withholding will not apply, however, to a holder who:
 
 
•
 in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on an
IRS Form W-9 or successor form;
 
 
•
 in the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8 or successor form; or
 
 
•
 is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld under these rules may be credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability and may entitle the holder to a refund if required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Possible Legislative Changes — Possible Change in Tax Rates
This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the
date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences (including applicable tax
rates) different from those summarized above. We cannot assure you that a change in law, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with
retroactive application, will not alter significantly the tax considerations (including applicable tax rates) that we describe herein. We have not sought and
do not plan to seek any ruling from the IRS, with respect to statements made and the conclusions reached in the above discussion, and there can be no
assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions.
THE FOREGOING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE
MERGER AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. THEREFORE, HOLDERS OF SHARES OF OUR STOCK ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S.
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

CorePoint has not determined whether it will hold its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders due to the merger proposal. If the merger is consummated, we
will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our stockholders. If the merger is not completed,
CorePoint stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in CorePoint’s annual meeting of stockholders. If CorePoint holds its 2022
annual meeting of stockholders, any stockholder proposal intended for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2022 annual meeting must be received by
our Secretary at our headquarters no later than December 15, 2021. In addition, our bylaws permit stockholders to nominate candidates for director and
present other business for consideration at our annual meeting of stockholders. To make a director nomination or present other business for
consideration at the 2022 annual meeting, you must submit a timely notice in accordance with the procedures described in our bylaws. To be timely, a
stockholder’s notice must be delivered to the Secretary at our headquarters of not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary
of the date the preceding year’s proxy statement is released to stockholders. Therefore, to be presented at our 2022 annual meeting, such a proposal must
be received on or after November 15, 2021, but not later than December 15, 2021. In the event that the date of the 2022 annual meeting is advanced or
delayed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
delivered not earlier than the 150th day prior to the 2022 annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to the
2022 annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2022 annual meeting is first made. Any such
proposal will be considered timely only if it is otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in our bylaws.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering a single proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those
stockholders, unless contrary instructions have been received. This procedure, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” reduces the amount of
duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs for companies.
Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of our common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding our common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. You may decide at any time to
revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies of proxy materials. If you wish to opt out of this procedure and receive a separate
set of proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one, you should contact your broker, trustee or
other nominee or CorePoint at the address and telephone number below. A separate copy of these proxy materials will be promptly delivered to any
stockholder upon written request to Secretary, CorePoint Lodging Inc., 125 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 1650, Irving, Texas 44124 or by telephone at

ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS
SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any of the following securities:
(a) Merger Consideration. Each share of Common Stock (as defined below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such
share, a “Share”) (other than (i) the Cancelled Shares and the Converted Shares and (ii) Shares of Restricted Stock (as defined below)) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $15.65 per share in cash, without interest (as adjusted pursuant to Section 6.17 or
Section 6.19, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares that have been converted into a right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall no longer be outstanding, shall be cancelled and extinguished automatically and shall cease
to exist, and each former holder of such Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares, except for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance
with this Article II.
(b) Cancellation of Cancelled Shares; Certain Subsidiary Owned Shares. Each Share owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time and not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”) shall cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be
cancelled without any conversion thereof or payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. Each Share that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) (the “Converted Shares”) shall be converted into such number of
limited partnership units of the Surviving Entity such that each such subsidiary’s ownership percentage in the Surviving Entity immediately after the
Effective Time is the same as such subsidiary’s ownership percentage in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking into account
the conversion of Merger Sub common stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d)).
(c) Company Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of
Cumulative Redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Preferred Stock”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into a unit of a newly created series of preferred limited partnership interests of
Merger Sub with substantially identical powers, preferences, privileges and rights as the Company Preferred Stock (all interests of each such newly
created series, collectively, the “New Merger Sub Preferred Equity”) and, upon such conversion, the Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.
(d) Merger Sub Limited Partnership Interests. Each limited partnership interest of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall remain an issued and outstanding limited partnership interest of the Surviving Entity and shall not be affected by the Merger. The general
partnership interest of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain an issued and outstanding general
partnership interest of the Surviving Entity and shall not be affected by the Merger.
SECTION 2.2 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.
(a) Treatment of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Common Stock subject to
vesting restrictions granted under the Company Stock Plan (the “Restricted Stock”), restricted stock unit (other than a PSU) or deferred stock unit
granted under the Company Stock Plan (any such arrangement, other than a PSU, a “Stock Unit”) shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Stock Unit to receive (without
interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Stock Unit immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the
terms of any applicable Stock Unit award agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
 
A-3
Table of Contents
(b) Treatment of Performance-Based Stock Units. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit
granted under the Company Stock Plan (any such arrangement, a “PSU”) , shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, become immediately vested and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such PSU to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, calculated based on the
greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of such PSU, and (B) target level performance,
multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the terms of any
applicable PSU award agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
(c) Corporate Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary or required to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 2.2.
(d) Required Payments. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Entity shall cooperate to cause the payment due pursuant to this Section 2.2 to be made
promptly following the Effective Time, including that the Surviving Entity shall cause payments due to current and former employees to be paid through
its payroll system or payroll provider in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 2.2, to the extent any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 relate to a Company Equity Award that is nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company and/or the Surviving Entity shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under
the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company Equity Award that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code.
SECTION 2.3 Surrender of Shares.
(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
“Paying Agent Agreement”) with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company’s prior written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”)
to receive payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(a). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, (i) a cash amount in immediately available
funds sufficient in the aggregate, to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (ii) book entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the units of New Merger Sub Preferred Equity issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for outstanding shares of the Company Preferred Stock (clause (A) and (B) collectively, the “Exchange Fund”).
The Paying Agent shall not invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund unless otherwise directed by Parent; provided that any such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the
 
A-4
Table of Contents
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Entity, as
requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall not be used for any purpose other than as
contemplated by this Section 2.3(a).
(b) Exchange Procedures.
(i) Transmittal Materials. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding (i) Shares, if any (“Common Certificates”) or (ii) Company Preferred Stock, if any (“Preferred Certificates” and together with the
Common Certificates, the “Certificates”), and each former holder of record of (i) Shares held in book-entry form (“Common Book-Entry Shares”) (other
than holders of Cancelled Shares) or (ii) shares of Company Preferred Stock held in book-entry form (“Preferred Book-Entry Shares” and together with the
Common Book-Entry Shares, the “Book-Entry Shares”) (in each case, other than holders of Cancelled Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter
of transmittal in customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon proper delivery of an “agent’s
message” regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal materials to be in such form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration or the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled.
(ii) Certificates. Upon surrender of one or more Certificates to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and
instructions as contemplated in Section 2.3(b)(i), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, each holder of record of one or more Certificates, if any, shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, (i) in respect of Common Certificates, a cash amount in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of
Shares represented by such Certificates by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration or (ii) in respect of Preferred Certificates, the New Merger Sub
Preferred Equity, as applicable, payable in respect of the Shares or the Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
(iii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to
deliver a Certificate to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable, that such holder is entitled to
pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) shall upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
surrendered such Shares or the Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such “agent’s message” or such other
evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, (i) in respect of Common Book-Entry Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Shares
represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration or (ii) in respect of Preferred Book-Entry Shares, the New Merger Sub
Preferred Equity, as applicable, payable in respect of the Shares or the Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, and the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

(iv) Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares or Company Preferred Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration or issuance of the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable,
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, are registered, then (i) in
respect of the Common Certificates or the Common Book-Entry Shares, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Common
Certificates or Common Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, or (ii) in respect of the Preferred Certificates or the Preferred Book-Entry Shares, the shares of
any New Merger Sub Preferred Equity to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Preferred Certificates or the Preferred Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, formerly representing such Shares or Company
Preferred Stock, as applicable, are properly presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (together, if applicable, with a letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions
(as applicable)) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration or New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable, as contemplated by this Article II. The
Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of Shares or Company Preferred Stock, as
applicable, for the Per Share Merger Consideration or the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable, in each case as set forth in the Paying Agent
Agreement.
(c) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
former holders of Shares or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity upon
demand. Any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter be entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) or issuance of the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable, upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares acceptable to the Surviving Entity, without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(b), and the
Surviving Entity shall remain responsible for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such holder’s claim for
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable, or the issuance of the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity, as applicable, upon due surrender of its Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Entity, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares or Company Preferred Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the Shares or Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and acceptable, to the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for (i) the cash amount in immediately
available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 2.3(f)) or (ii) the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), as applicable.
The Per Share Merger Consideration paid, or the New Merger Sub Preferred Equity issued, as applicable, upon surrender of Certificates or receipt by the
Paying Agent of an “agent’s message”, if applicable, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, in each case in accordance with the
 
A-6
Table of Contents
terms of this Article II, shall be deemed to have been paid, or issued, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares or Company Preferred Stock,
as applicable, formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.
(e) Lost Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such customary terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Entity with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will (i) issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to the amount the holder of such Common Certificate is entitled to as set forth in this Article II or (ii) issue the New
Merger Sub Preferred Equity to which the holder of such Preferred Certificate is entitled to as set forth in this Article II.
(f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Entity (and any agent or designee thereof) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent, the Company or the
Surviving Entity (or any agent or designee thereof), as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the applicable Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Surviving Entity (or any agent or designee thereof), as the case may be.
SECTION 2.4 Appraisal Rights. No dissenters’ or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions, including any
remedy under Sections 3-201 et seq. of the MGCL and the Board of Directors of the Company has not determined and will not determine prior to the
Effective Time that any such rights shall be available.
SECTION 2.5 Tax Treatment of the Transactions. The Parties intend that, for United States federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes, the
Transactions shall be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of the Company’s assets to Merger Sub in exchange for the aggregate Per Share Merger

date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties party thereto and neither is Parent aware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date
hereof or that would or would reasonably be expected to cause the Financing Commitments to be ineffective. Assuming that the conditions to the
obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied, as of the date hereof, there are no conditions

other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, to the
knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or any other party thereto under the Financing Commitments or (iii) result in any portion of the amount
to be provided or funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments being unavailable on the Closing Date. Assuming that the conditions to the
obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied, and assuming the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Financing Commitments, Parent will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration and the other payments under Article II, (including, to the extent required pursuant to Section 6.19, the aggregate IRS Matter Incremental
Per Share Merger Consideration), (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and the Surviving Entity in connection with the
Merger and the Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries contemplated by this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments, and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity contemplated

applicable Guarantor and of each of the other parties thereto and (ii) enforceable in accordance with its respective terms against the applicable Guarantor
and each of the other parties subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There is no default under the Limited Guarantees by the Guarantors, and no
event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Guarantors.

Merger and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Entity taken together with its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will not: (i) be
insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the fair market
value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts, or be expected to incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond its ability to pay

with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’
duties under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) in order to enter
into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company pays to Parent any Company Termination
Payment required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i) at or prior to the time of such termination (it being agreed that such termination shall not be
effective unless such fee is so paid); provided further, that, (A) the Company will not be entitled to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(d)(ii) unless (i) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (such notice, a “Company Notice”) advising
Parent that the Company’s Board of Directors intends to take such action and containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that
is the basis of the proposed action of the Board of Directors of the Company (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and a
written summary of any additional material terms and conditions communicated orally), and shall include with such notice unredacted copies of the
proposed transaction agreement (if any) and copies of any other documents evidencing or specifying the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Company Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fourth (4th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the “Notice Period”), (B) after giving such Company Notice and
prior to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent requested by Parent),
to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of
the Notice Period, prior to and as a condition to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take
into account in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Company Notice and any other
information offered by Parent in response to the Company Notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, if such changes offered in writing by
Parent (if any) were to be given effect. Any revision, amendment, update or supplement to the consideration or any other material terms of any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 6.1(d) and this Section 6.1(c)(i) and require a new
Company Notice, except that references in this Section 6.1(c)(i) to “four (4) Business Days” shall be deemed to be references to “two (2) Business Days”
and such two (2) Business Day period shall expire at 5:00 p.m. on the second (2nd) Business Day immediately following the day on which such new
Company Notice is delivered (it being understood and agreed that in no event shall any such additional two (2) Business Day Notice Period be deemed to
shorten the initial four (4) Business Day Notice Period).
(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board of
Directors of the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation if (x) an Intervening Event has occurred, and (y) prior to taking such action, the Board
of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), that failure to take
such action in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation, (A) the Company shall give Parent a Company Notice four (4) Business Days
in advance, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening
 
A-31
Table of Contents
Event, (B) after giving such Company Notice and prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
(to the extent requested by Parent), to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement and (C) at the end of the Notice Period, prior to and as a condition to
effecting a Change of Recommendation, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account in good faith any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Company Notice and any other information offered by Parent in response to the Company
Notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that (I) such Intervening
Event remains in effect and (II) the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law if such changes proposed in writing by Parent (if any) were to be given effect.
(d) Notice of Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that immediately following the date hereof it shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
give notice to Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the Person making, such proposal, including proposed agreements received by the Company relating to such Acquisition Proposal, and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments or proposed amendments to the material terms thereof) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and promptly provide (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the Company provided to any other person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) inform Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin providing information or
to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.1(b). Unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any person other than Parent from the restrictions on “business
combinations” contained in any applicable Takeover Law or in the organizational documents of the Company, or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply. The Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement with any person which directly or indirectly prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 6.1.
(e) Existing Discussions. The Company agrees that immediately following the date hereof it shall (i) cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations
with any Person (other than the Parties and their respective Representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, in each case that exist as of the
date hereof, (ii) promptly request each Person (other than the Parties and their respective Representatives) that has prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company to return or destroy all confidential information furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries prior to the date hereof and (iii) promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access
previously granted to such Persons. The Company shall enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without Parent’s prior written consent, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement; provided that, if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular standstill provision would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law, the Company may, waive such standstill solely to the extent
necessary to permit the applicable Person (if it has not been solicited in material violation of this Section 6.1) to make, on a confidential basis to the Board
of Directors of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in
each case as contemplated by this Section 6.1 so long as the Company promptly notifies Parent thereof after granting any such waiver.

Directors of the Company) of the consolidated total assets (it being understood that total assets include equity securities of subsidiaries of the
Company) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole); in each case of clauses (A) through (D), other than the Transactions; provided that

Company as of the date of this Agreement), which becomes known to the Company or to the Board of Directors of the Company after the date of this

deemed to be references to “80% or more”), that the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor(s), in good faith determines (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and (y) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable (including from a financial point of view) to the stockholders of the Company than the Transactions, in each case after
taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, including legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and stockholder approval requirements, the sources, availability and terms of any
financing, financing market conditions and the existence of any financing contingency, the likelihood of termination, the likely timing of closing, the
identity of and any prior dealings with the Person or Persons making the proposal, timing or other aspects of such proposal and the Transactions and any
other aspects considered relevant in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company and after taking into account any changes to the terms of this

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by a Party, which information would require any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and the
Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent required
by applicable Law. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information

SECTION 6.3 Stockholders Meeting. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the Company is made aware that the SEC will not review the Proxy Statement or has no further comments on the

necessary to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of (a) approving the Merger and (b) if and only if required or otherwise mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before
a meeting of stockholders in connection with the approval of a merger or the transactions contemplated by a merger agreement (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Stockholders Meeting”); provided that the Company may (and, at the written request of Parent, shall)
postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting (i) to the extent required by Law or duty, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to
the extent the Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, (iii) if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel is necessary under applicable Law or duty and
 
A-34

for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting;
provided that such adjournment or postponement shall not delay the Stockholders Meeting to a date on or after the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding
the End Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall (a) include
in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation (subject to Section 6.1(b)(iv)), and, subject to the consent of J.P. Morgan, the written opinion of J.P. Morgan,
and (b) subject to Section 6.1(b)(iv), use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote (it being understood that the foregoing shall
not require the Board of Directors of the Company to recommend in favor of the approval of the Merger if a Change of Recommendation has been
effected in accordance with Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section 6.1(c)(ii)); provided that the Board of Directors of the Company may (A) fail to include the
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) withdraw, modify, qualify, amend or change the Recommendation, (C) fail to recommend in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to
Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act for outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent), in each
case, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement thereof, it being understood and agreed that, for all purposes of this Agreement, a
communication by the Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or
any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer, shall not, in and
of itself, be deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation (so long as any such disclosure (x) includes an express reaffirmation of the
Recommendation, without any amendment, withdrawal, alteration, modification or qualification thereof and (y) does not include any statement that
constitutes, and does not otherwise constitute, a Change of Recommendation), or (D) formally resolve to effect or publicly announce an intention or
resolution to effect any of the foregoing (any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (D), a “Change of Recommendation”), in each
case solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section 6.1(c)(ii) and, following such Change of Recommendation, may fail
to use such reasonable best efforts; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (I) the determination by the Board of Directors of the
Company that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (II) the taking of any action by the Company, its Board of Directors or any of its
Representatives permitted by Section 6.1(b) or (III) the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section
6.1(c)(ii), in each case so long as the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company does not intentionally issue any public statement to such effect
and does not otherwise effect a Change of Recommendation thereby, will in and of itself constitute a Change of Recommendation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Stockholders Meeting shall be convened
and the Merger shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of such obligation, including as a result of a Change of Recommendation.
SECTION 6.4 Further Action; Efforts.
(a) Each Party shall (and, in the case of Parent, cause each of its subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates (collectively, the “Parent Group”) to) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations or pursuant to any contract or agreement to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable (and in any event no later than the End Date) and consummate the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings, and to obtain as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) all actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, registrations, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Transactions expeditiously. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto agrees in the event
that a filing is required pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions, to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, and to use its reasonable
best efforts to supply as
 
A-35

promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any applicable Antitrust Law
and to use its reasonable best efforts to take any and all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Parent will be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees payable to Governmental
Entities under any Antitrust Law.
(b) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts and obligations referenced in Section 6.4(a), use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) consult and cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) subject to applicable Law, furnish to the other Party as promptly
as reasonably practicable all information required for any application or other filing to be made by the other Party pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the Transactions; (iii) promptly notify the other Party of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions and, subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party promptly with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between
them and any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions; (iv) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from,
and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or documentation that may be requested by any Governmental Entity in
respect of the Transactions; and (v) permit the other Party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance, and
consider in good faith the other Party’s reasonable comments in connection with, any filing, notice, application, submission, communication, meeting or
conference with, any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person. No Party shall independently
participate in any meeting or communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other Parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted, the opportunity to attend and/or participate therein. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but without limiting each Party’s obligations under this Section 6.4, Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties,
control and lead all communications and strategy for dealing with the applicable Governmental Entities with respect to any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, and Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead the defense strategy for
dealing with all Proceedings challenging the Transactions that are brought by any applicable Governmental Entity with respect to any Antitrust Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, neither Parent nor any member of the Parent Group shall extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR
Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the
Company.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall
cause each member of the Parent Group to, take any and all steps necessary, proper or advisable to (x) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or (y) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of, and
have vacated, modified, suspended, eliminated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, decision, determination, order or judgment entered or issued, or
that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, that would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, restrain, enjoin, prohibit, make
unlawful, restrict or delay the consummation of the contemplated transactions, so as to enable the Parties to close the contemplated transactions
expeditiously (but in no event later than the End Date), including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to, agreeing to and effecting, the sale, lease,
divesture, disposition, or license (or holding separate pending such disposition) of any assets, operations, rights, product lines, licenses, properties,
products, rights, services or businesses, or any interests therein, of the Company or its subsidiaries, (B) taking or agreeing to restrictions or actions that
after the Effective Time would limit any Party’s or its controlled Affiliates’ freedom of action or operations with respect to, or its or their ability to retain,
any assets, operations, rights, product lines, licenses, properties, products, rights, services or businesses, in each case, of the Company or its
subsidiaries, or interests therein, or (C) agreeing to enter into, modify or terminate existing contractual relationships, and promptly effecting the sale,
lease, license, divestiture and holding separate of, assets, operations, rights, product lines, licenses, properties, products, rights, services or businesses
of the Company or its subsidiaries and the entry

into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving effect thereto or to such restrictions or actions; provided,
however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require (I) the Company or Parent to effectuate or agree to effectuate any such action unless it is
conditioned upon the Closing and only effective following the Closing, or (II) Parent to effect or agree, commit or consent to any divestiture, hold
separate order, limitation on conduct or any other remedial action with respect to impacting any assets, operations, rights, product lines, licenses,
properties, products, rights, services or businesses, or any interests therein, of Parent or any Person other than the Company or its subsidiaries, or
interests therein.
(d) Subject to the obligations under Section 6.4(c), in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other Transaction, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, (i)
each of Parent and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group to, cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, modified, suspended, eliminated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents, restrains,
enjoins, prohibits, makes unlawful, restricts or delays consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group, at
Parent’s cost and expense, defend through litigation on the merits of any claim or action asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person
or entity (including any Governmental Entity), whether judicial or administrative, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of, or otherwise in connection with, the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, and in
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, none of the Company, any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives, shall be
obligated to pay or commit to pay to any Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, agree to any term or make
any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation in connection with its obligations under this Section 6.4 that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Article VII, obtaining any approval or consent from
any Person pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not be a condition to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transactions.
(e) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any member of the Parent Group shall, and Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group not to, take any
action, including acquiring or agreeing to acquire, including by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any Person, corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, properties or equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation or such other action could reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity or private party necessary to consummate the
Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity or private party
seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions; or (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such
order on appeal or otherwise.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, the Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, provide sensitive information and
materials to the other Party on an outside counsel-only basis or directly to the applicable Governmental Entity, while, to the extent feasible, making a
version in which the sensitive information has been redacted available to the other Party.
SECTION 6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Entity or Parent and (b) any Actions commenced or, to such Party’s knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
Party or any of
 
A-37
Table of Contents
its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other Transactions; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not (i) cure
any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or (ii) limit the remedies available to the Party
receiving such notice. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Company’s, on the one hand, and Parent’s, on the other hand, compliance or failure of
compliance with this Section 6.5 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in Section 7.2(b) or Section
7.3(b), respectively, shall have been satisfied with respect to performance in all material respects with this Section 6.5.
SECTION 6.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.
(a) Subject to applicable Law and any applicable COVID-19 Measures, from the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier valid termination of this
Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice from Parent, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries,
officers, directors, employees and representatives to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, during
normal business hours to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, employees, books and records, and to the Company Real Property, as reasonably
necessary to facilitate consummation of the Transactions; provided, that such access may be limited to the extent the Company or any of its subsidiaries
reasonably determines, in light of applicable COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, that such access would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health
and safety of any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, it being understood that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide, or cause its subsidiaries to provide, such access in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health and safety of the
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of their normal duties and shall not
include any sampling or testing of environmental media or building materials or any other environmental sampling or testing.
(b) The foregoing provisions of Section 6.6(a) shall not require and shall not be construed to require the Company to permit any access to any of its
officers, employees, agents, Contracts, books or records, or its properties, offices or other facilities, or to permit any inspection, review, sampling or audit,
or to disclose or otherwise make available any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would (i) unreasonably interfere with the
Company’s or its subsidiaries’ business operations, (ii) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third parties, competitively sensitive
information, information reflecting the Company’s or its advisor’s analysis of the valuation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or violate the terms
of any confidentiality provisions in any agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, (iii) result in a violation of applicable
Law, (iv) waive the protection of any attorney-client privilege or (v) result in the disclosure of any personal information that would reasonably be
expected to expose the Company to the risk of liability under applicable Laws. In the event that the Company objects to any request submitted pursuant
to and in accordance with Section 6.6(a) and withholds information on the basis of the foregoing clauses (ii) through (v), the Company shall inform Parent
as to the general nature of what is being withheld and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments (including, if reasonably requested by Parent, entering into a joint
defense agreement with Parent on customary and mutually acceptable terms if requested with respect to any such information). The Company may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to Parent as “Outside Counsel Only Material” or with similar restrictions, which materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of Parent or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to
any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the Parties. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be
directed to the Person designated by the Company and all information exchanged or made available shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Effective Time and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act at the Effective Time.
SECTION 6.8 Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Transactions shall be a joint press release and, except in connection with the receipt or
existence of an Acquisition Proposal and matters related thereto or a Change of Recommendation (in each case subject to the applicable terms of this
Agreement), thereafter the Company, Parent shall consult with each other prior to issuing, and give each other the reasonable opportunity to review, any
press releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and prior to making any filings with any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as
may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of the Company, by the duties of the Board of Directors of the Company
as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of the Company), in each case, as determined in the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to
make such release or other public announcement (in which case, such Party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other Party); provided, that (a) any such press release or public statement as may be required by
applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange may be issued prior to such consultation if the Party making the release or
statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Party on a timely basis and (b) each Party may issue public announcements or
make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions that consist solely of information previously disclosed in press releases or
public statements previously approved by either Party or made by either Party in compliance with this Section 6.8 to the extent such disclosure is

first sentence of this Section 6.8 shall not apply to (x) any disclosure of information concerning this Agreement or any Transaction Document in
connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions and (y) internal announcements to employees which are
not made public. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates may provide ordinary course communications regarding this Agreement and the
Transactions to existing or prospective general and limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of any Affiliates of such Person, in
each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions.
SECTION 6.9 Employee Benefits.
(a) For a period of at least 12 months following the Effective Time (the “Benefit Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide to each employee of the
Company or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving Entity or any subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (the “Continuing Employees”),
(i) a salary, wage and target bonus opportunity that, in each case, is no less favorable than the salary, wage and target bonus opportunity that was
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee welfare and other benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate to the employee welfare and other benefits (excluding equity-based compensation, defined benefit pensions or post-employment health or
 
A-39
Table of Contents
welfare benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the duration of the Benefit Continuation Period,
Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee a severance or termination arrangement no less favorable than
the severance or termination arrangement provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of which is listed in
Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(b) If the Closing has not occurred by January 1, 2022, then on or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, a pro-rated portion of the bonuses or
short term incentives that relate to performance during the Company’s 2022 fiscal year shall (each, a “Prorated Bonus”) be paid to employees eligible to
receive such bonuses or incentives pursuant to terms of the Company’s annual bonus plans or short term incentive plans that relate to the 2022 fiscal
year (the “2022 Bonus Plans”), with the amount of each Prorated Bonus based on the number of days that occurs during the 2022 fiscal year prior to the
Closing (with performance goals or metrics deemed achieved at target). If the Closing has not occurred by January 31, 2022, then Parent shall honor and
assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed, the 2022 Bonus Plans in accordance with their terms, provided that such plans have been adopted
and implemented without violation of this Agreement.
(c) To the extent that any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective subsidiaries is made available to any Continuing
Employee on or following the Effective Time (a “Parent Benefit Plan”), Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and any subsidiaries
thereof) shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work
requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which participation commences
towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the commencement of participation for which
payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that it would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such service was recognized under
a similar Company Plan, give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee’s employment with the Company for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding eligibility or benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under each applicable
Parent Benefit Plan as if such service had been performed with Parent.
(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Entity
or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Company or any Affiliate of
Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.9 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or
other modification of any Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating any Company
Plans in accordance with their terms or (iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).
SECTION 6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (the “Indemnified Parties”), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal (each, a “Proceeding”), arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or serving in such
 
A-40
Table of Contents
capacity at the request thereof or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time in such person’s capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or serving in such capacity at the request thereof, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Maryland Law and its Company Charter and Company Bylaws in
effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Entity shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any subsidiary; provided that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10); provided further that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officer’s or
director’s conduct complies with the standards set forth under Maryland Law and the Company’s Charter and the Company’s Bylaws shall be made by
independent counsel selected by the Surviving Entity. In the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (y) the Surviving Entity shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In
the event any Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this
Section 6.10, (i) the Surviving Entity shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Entity shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Entity
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any one such counsel retained by an Indemnified Party promptly after statements therefor are received,
whether or not the Surviving Entity shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iv) no Indemnified Party shall be liable for any
settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Entity of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the
extent such failure actually prejudices the indemnifying Party.
(c) The provisions in the Surviving Entity’s limited partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such
provisions contained in the Company’s Charter and the Company’s Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
such individuals.
(d) The Company shall purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no later than the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid “tail policy”
providing at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured than the current policies
of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time, including the Transactions, and from insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by
A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided that in no event will the premium of such insurance coverage exceed 300%
of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such purpose. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a “tail policy”, Parent shall
maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. If the Company elects not to purchase
such a “tail policy”, then Parent shall maintain at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six years from the Effective Time the current policies
of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to
matters existing
 
A-41
Table of Contents
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’
liability insurance; provided that in no event will the premium of such insurance coverage exceed 300% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company for such purpose. Parent agrees to honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party.
(e) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Entity shall assume or succeed to all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.
(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws or the comparable governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.
(g) The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall survive the Merger for a period of six years following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and representatives.
SECTION 6.11 Parent Financing.
(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange,
obtain and consummate the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (A) comply with and maintain in full force and effect the Financing
Commitments, (B) negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms contained in the Debt Financing
Commitments (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto in accordance with the terms set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment) or on
terms that are substantially comparable or more favorable to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any “market
flex” provisions applicable thereto), in each case, which terms do not effectuate Restricted Financing Changes (such definitive agreements, the
“Definitive Financing Agreements”), (C) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions applicable to Parent in the Financing
Commitments and such Definitive Financing Agreements that are to be satisfied by Parent and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing,

Financing. Parent shall obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Closing in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Closing). To the extent reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed
in reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing, and Parent shall promptly
respond to any such request from the Company concerning such status.
(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions
applicable thereto) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments or to the extent that Parent reasonably believes in good faith that it will not have
funds available that are sufficient to enable it to fund the Financing Uses in full, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts and as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such event, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient,

Financing”) and to obtain and provide the Company with a copy of, the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the
“Alternative Financing Commitment Letter”), which Alternative Financing Commitment Letter will not, and Parent shall not be required to agree to, (i)
include terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto) that are less beneficial to Parent than those contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitments (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto), taken as a whole, or (ii) involve (or expand upon) any
conditions to funding of the Debt Financing that are more onerous than the conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments; provided, that
nothing herein or in any other provision of this Agreement shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or
construed to require, (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates to waive any material term or condition of this Agreement, (ii) Parent or any of its Affiliates to seek
alternative financing to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent or (iii) Parent or any of its Affiliates to seek any additional
equity financing commitments. As applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this Agreement made by Parent

Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement or any provision of any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement (including
any proposal by any Debt Financing Source to withdraw, terminate, repudiate, rescind or make a material change in the terms of (including the amount of
Financing contemplated) any Financing Commitment) or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement. Parent shall promptly provide to the Company and its Representatives any and all information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this Section 6.11(c).

thereunder), (ii) any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination or other modification or waiver of any condition, provision or remedy
under, the Debt Financing Commitments or Definitive Financing Agreements if such amendment, restatement, supplement, termination, reduction,
modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to (A) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing or

from those set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments on the date of this Agreement, (B) change the timing of the funding of the Financing thereunder,

doubt, Parent may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof; or (iii) the early termination of
the Financing Commitments or any Definitive Financing Agreement prior to the receipt of the applicable Financing to an amount less than the amount

subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the

without the prior written consent of the Company, to assign all or any portion of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement, from and after

Debt Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning collateral in respect of the Debt Financing.
SECTION 9.8 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a) at and after the Effective Time, with respect to the provisions of

third-party beneficiary of this Section 9.8(e), Section 8.2(f) [Effect of Termination] and Section 9.2, Section 9.9, Section 9.14 and Section 9.17 [Debt
Financing Sources].
SECTION 9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in
accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the matters
contained in Article I and Article II shall be governed by the MGCL, including matters relating to the filing of the Articles of Merger and the effects of the
Merger, including any appraisal or dissenters’ rights, and all matters relating to the duties of the Company Board of Directors shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard of the conflict of law principles thereof to the extent that such principles
would direct a matter to another jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.10 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
SECTION 9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission, “.pdf,” or other electronic transmission,
or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000 (including DocuSign)) in one or more counterparts, and by the different
Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same agreement.
SECTION 9.12 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required
of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof,
 
A-65
Table of Contents
without proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the posting of security, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach. The Parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including Section 6.4 [Further Action; Efforts] and Section
6.11 [Parent Financing]) by Parent and, subject to the next sentence, to cause Parent to consummate the Transactions (for the avoidance of doubt,
including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 [Closing]) on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein or in any Transaction Document to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing if, and only if, (i) Parent is required to
consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2 and Parent fails to consummate the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to with Section 1.2 [Closing], (ii) the financing provided for by the Debt Financing Commitments (or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing)
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in
writing to Parent that all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied or validly waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by the taking of actions or delivery of documents on the Closing Date but each of which is capable of being satisfied at
the Closing), if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing that has been obtained
in accordance with Section 6.11[Parent Financing]) are funded, then the Company will take such actions within the Company’s control to cause the
Closing to occur in accordance with Section 1.2 (and the Company has not revoked, withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation). Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x)
either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may concurrently seek (i) specific performance or other equitable relief,
subject in all respects to this Section 9.12 and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee or monetary damages if, as and when required pursuant to this
Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Financing Commitment), on the one hand, and payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, on the other hand.
SECTION 9.13 Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or arising
out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions or the actions of any Party in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and
thereof, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees
that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the courts of the State of Delaware, as

service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.4 shall be effective service
of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section
9.13, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
 
A-66

attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action
or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended
to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America.

interpretation against the Party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

Debt Financing Sources.
SECTION 9.18 Protected REITs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that counsel or independent accountants for
the Company determine in writing that there exists a material risk that the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this Agreement would be treated
as Nonqualifying Income (or such payment would otherwise affect the Company’s status as a REIT) upon the payment of such amounts to the Company,
the amount paid to the Company pursuant to this Agreement in any tax year shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company in
such year without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount were
Nonqualifying Income (or such payment would otherwise affect the Company’s status as a REIT) as determined by such counsel or independent
accountants to the Company. If the amount payable for any tax year pursuant to the preceding sentence is less than the amount which Parent would
otherwise be obligated to pay to the Company pursuant to this Agreement (the “Expense Amount”), then: (1) Parent shall place the Expense Amount into
an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall include that (y)
the amount in the Escrow Account shall be treated as the property of Parent, unless it is released from such Escrow Account to the Company, and (z) (A)

Parent whether or not said income has been distributed during such taxable year, and (B) Parent will be entitled to customary quarterly tax distributions
with respect to any income earned on the Escrow Account, and the escrow agent shall not release any portion thereof to the Company, and the Company
shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until the Company, at its own cost and

expense, delivers to Parent, at the sole option of the Company, (i) an opinion of the Company’s tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the
extent paid, would not constitute Nonqualifying Income (or such amount would not otherwise affect the Company’s status as a REIT), (ii) a letter from the
Company’s independent accountants indicating the maximum portion of the Expense Amount that can be paid at that time to the Company without
causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, or (iii) a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to the Company
indicating that the receipt of any Expense Amount hereunder will not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the REIT Requirements); and (2) the Company
shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the escrow as contemplated by clause (1) in this Section 9.18. Except as otherwise provided for in this
