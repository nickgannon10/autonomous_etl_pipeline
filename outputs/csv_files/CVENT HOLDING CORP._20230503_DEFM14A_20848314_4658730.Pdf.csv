We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $4,589,000,000, which will be funded via the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing and the Preferred
Equity Financing described below.
The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent
and Merger Sub have represented to Cvent that, assuming the consummation of the Preferred Equity Financing, the
amounts funded pursuant to the Financing Letters will be sufficient to pay the fees and expenses of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub (including in connection with the Merger and the Financing).
In connection with the financing of the Merger, each of Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (“MSSF”), UBS AG,
Stamford Branch (“UBS”), UBS Securities LLC (“UBSS”) and Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens” and, together with
MSSF, UBS, UBSS and any other party that agrees to become an additional commitment party pursuant to the terms
of the Debt Commitment Letter (as defined below), the “Financing Sources”) executed that certain Debt Commitment
Letter, dated as of March 14, 2023 (the “Debt Commitment Letter” and, together with the Equity Commitment Letters,
the “Financing Letters”), whereby MSSF, UBS and Citizens committed to provide a senior secured term loan facility in
an aggregate principal amount of up to $900,000,000 and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate
amount of up to $100,000,000, which will be used for the purpose of, among other things, allowing Parent and/or
Merger Sub to fund a portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration, the repayment of certain of the Company’s
outstanding indebtedness and to pay the related fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the
closing of the Merger.
In connection with the financing of the Merger, the Guarantors have entered into equity commitment letters in favor
of Parent, dated as of March 14, 2023 for the commitment to purchase in the aggregate up to $2,531,000,000 of the
equity securities of Parent (the “Equity Commitment Letters”), solely for the purpose of allowing Parent and/or
Merger Sub to fund a portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration and to pay related fees and expenses of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub (including in connection with the Merger). Cvent is an express third-party
beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the commitment
under the Equity Commitment Letters by the Guarantors to be funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letters, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against the Guarantors to perform their funding
obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters, in each case subject to (a) the limitations and conditions set forth
in the Equity Commitment Letters and (b) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the limited guarantees delivered by the Guarantors in favor of Cvent, dated as of March 14, 2023 (the
“Limited Guarantees”), the Guarantors have agreed to guarantee the performance and payment of certain liabilities
and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap equal to
$282,216,878.
The Vista Stockholders have committed, pursuant to a commitment letter (the “Preferred Commitment Letter”), dated
as of March 14, 2023, to provide the Preferred Equity Financing (as defined below in the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Financing Efforts”), pursuant to which the Vista Stockholders will invest a
portion of their proceeds from the merger consideration to acquire non-convertible preferred shares with an initial
liquidation preference of $1,250,000,000, to be issued by Capstone TopCo, Inc., the indirect parent company of Parent.
The closing of the Preferred Equity Financing is expected to occur substantially concurrently with the consummation
of the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Preferred Commitment Letter.

The obligations of Cvent, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of various conditions on or prior to the Effective Time, including the following:
•
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders;
•
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), and receipt of the approvals, clearances or

7TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the absence of any law, injunction or order from any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any
party to the Merger Agreement (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) prohibiting, enjoining or
otherwise making illegal the consummation of the Merger.
Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain additional
conditions, including:
•
subject to certain materiality and other qualifiers, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
other party;
•
the other party has complied in all material respects with the covenants and obligations of the Merger
Agreement required to be performed and complied by such party at or prior to the closing;
•
the delivery of a customary closing certificate signed on behalf of the respective party by an officer of such
party certifying certain conditions have been satisfied; and

in the case of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations, the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect
(which term is described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement -
Representations and Warranties”).
The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon Parent’s receipt of financing.
Before the closing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may waive any of the conditions to its obligation to
consummate the Merger even though one or more of the conditions described above has not been met, except where
waiver is not permissible under applicable law.

The consummation of the Merger is subject to review under the HSR Act. As described above in the section of this
proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions of the Merger,” the obligations of Parent and the
Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act.
Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until
notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the Federal Trade Commission (the
“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the specified waiting period has
expired or been terminated. The Company and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms
under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on March 28, 2023. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at
11:59 PM EDT on April 27, 2023. Both before and after the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the
DOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds.
The consummation of the Merger is also conditioned upon the receipt of the consents and approvals required by the
antitrust authorities in certain other jurisdictions and other relevant authorities under foreign antitrust laws and
foreign investment laws. The Merger cannot be completed until Cvent and Parent obtain clearance to consummate
the Merger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions.

The Merger Agreement generally restricts the Company’s ability to:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or offer with respect to, that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger Agreement - No-Shop; Cvent Board Recommendation Change”);
•
furnish to any person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries with the intent to knowingly induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, any proposal or offer with respect to,
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;
•
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (or inquiries, proposals or offers that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal);
•
approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend to enter into, any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - No-Shop; Cvent Board Recommendation Change”).
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cvent stockholders, if the Cvent Board receives an Acquisition
Proposal that the Cvent Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger Agreement - No-Shop; Cvent Board Recommendation Change”), the Company is entitled to participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with and furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal.
The Cvent Board generally is not permitted under the Merger Agreement to change its recommendation to the
Company’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement. However, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement
by Cvent stockholders, the Cvent Board is permitted to make a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined
below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - No-Shop; Cvent Board Recommendation
Change”) in response to certain unforeseen, intervening events or to accept a Superior Proposal if, in either case, the
Cvent Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law. Any such Company Board Recommendation Change is subject to the procedures set
forth in the Merger Agreement, including that the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and its
representatives, if requested by Parent, for four business days (or three business days following an amended
Acquisition Proposal) to make amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related
documents so that, as applicable, the Cvent Board’s fiduciary duties no longer require it to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to the intervening event or the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal.",17,18

CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Appraisal Rights (page 109),"Appraisal Rights (page 109)
Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, Cvent stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cvent common stock
through the Effective Time and who do not vote such shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and
beneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such
person who beneficially own shares of Cvent common stock through the Effective Time that are not voted in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and in either case who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not
withdraw their demands and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Cvent common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL. The “fair value” of shares of Cvent common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could
be greater than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration that stockholders or beneficial owners would
otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Cvent common stock.
The right to seek appraisal will be lost with respect to shares that a Cvent stockholder votes “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement. However, abstaining or voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in
itself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to perfect such rights. To
exercise appraisal rights, Cvent stockholders (or beneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock held either in
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their
shares must so advise the Company by submitting a written demand for appraisal to the Company prior to the taking
of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and must otherwise strictly follow the applicable
procedures and requirements prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. Any demand for appraisal made by a beneficial
holder of shares of Cvent common stock with respect to shares held of record in the name of a voting trust or
nominee, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, on behalf of such person must (a) reasonably identify the holder
of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (b) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s
beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports
to be and (c) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company
and the office of the Register in Chancery and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the
DGCL. In addition, under Section 262 of the DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal
proceedings as to all stockholders and beneficial owners who have perfected their appraisal rights unless (i) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock or (ii) the value
of the per share Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Cvent common stock entitled to
appraisal exceeds $1 million.
In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners that may wish to
pursue appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors.

The receipt of cash by a holder of Cvent common stock who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this
proxy statement titled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) in exchange for shares of
Cvent common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign income or other tax laws.
Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a U.S. holder, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive (or are deemed to receive) in the Merger and your adjusted
tax basis in the shares of Cvent common stock converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. If you are a
holder of Cvent common stock who is a non-U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”), the Merger will generally not be a taxable
transaction to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States, or
the Company is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. Further, the Merger may
be a taxable transaction to you under non-U.S. tax laws, and you are encouraged to seek tax advice regarding such
matters. Because individual circumstances may differ, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the
particular tax effects to you.

Considerations” for a more complete discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.",20,20

CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the
Special Meeting and the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important
to you as a holder of Cvent common stock. You should read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in
this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On March 14, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cvent, with Cvent surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Cvent Board in favor of
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting as
described in this proxy statement.
As a holder of Cvent common stock, what will I receive in the Merger?
Each share of Cvent common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares of Cvent common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders or beneficial owners thereof have properly exercised
their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be automatically canceled,
extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The exchange of shares of Cvent common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For a more detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations.” You are urged to consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of how the
Merger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of Cvent common stock?
The Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share represents a premium of approximately 52% to the volume weighted
average share price over the 90 days prior to January 30, 2023 - the day before media reports of a potential transaction
were published. On May 2, 2023, the most recent practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, the closing
price of Cvent common stock was $8.42 per share.
What will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger?
Each Option granted in 2022 (other than Options granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will be governed by their original
terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such Option that would have otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest
(a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case, subject to the holder’s continued service through
the applicable vesting dates.
Each Vested Option, in each case, with an exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will, at the
Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest
and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Cvent common stock
subject to such Vested Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the excess of the Merger
Consideration minus the per share exercise price of such Vested Option.
Each Unvested Option that has an exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will, at the Effective
Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Cash Replacement Option Amounts,
which Cash Replacement Option Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable
vesting dates, generally vest and be payable (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) at the
same time as the Unvested Options for which the Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have
vested pursuant to their terms.
Each Option (whether a Vested Option or an Unvested Option) with an exercise price per share that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no consideration.
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each RSU award granted in 2022 (other than RSU awards granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will be governed by their
original terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such RSU award that would have otherwise vested in 2026 will
instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case, subject to the holder’s continued
service through the applicable vesting dates.
Each Vested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the
Merger Consideration and (b) the total number of shares of Cvent common stock subject to such Vested RSU award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Each Unvested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into and will become
the right to receive the Cash Replacement RSU Amounts, which Cash Replacement RSU Amounts will, subject to the
holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates, generally vest and be payable (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes) at the same time as the Unvested RSU awards for which the Cash
Replacement RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms.
When and where is the Special Meeting of our stockholders?
The special meeting will be held virtually on Thursday, June 1, 2023, at 9 a.m., Eastern time. Cvent is conducting the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What proposals will be considered at the Special Meeting?
At the Special Meeting, holders of Cvent common stock will be asked to consider and vote on the following
proposals:
•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”);
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the specified compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Cvent’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger (the “Compensation
Proposal”); and
•
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Pursuant to Cvent’s Bylaws, the only business that will be transacted at the Special Meeting are the Merger
Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, as stated in the accompanying notice of the
Special Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The
inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of
election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not
present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the
meeting to another date or time.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders
holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on
the record date. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting
(whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions
to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal.
Certain stockholders of the Company have executed the Voting Agreements concurrently with the execution of the
Merger Agreement, pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of
Cvent common stock owned by them, collectively constituting approximately 87.5% of the Company’s outstanding
common stock, in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement. For more information, see the section
of this proxy statement titled “Voting Agreements.”
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis,
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or
represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is
present, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a
“street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will
have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory and non-binding
and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or represented
by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares
deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name”
holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect
on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Adjournment Proposal.
What is a “broker non-vote”?
If a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee does
not provide the organization that holds the owner’s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner’s shares may generally vote on “discretionary” matters but
cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other
nominees return a valid proxy voting upon one or more other matters for which the applicable rules provide
discretionary authority or for which voting instructions have been provided but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter and have not received specific voting
instructions on that matter from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Cvent does not expect any broker non-votes
at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with
discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be
presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be
permitted to vote your shares of Cvent common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure
to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of Cvent common stock will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
How do the Special Committee and the Cvent Board recommend that I vote?
The Cvent Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger
Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Cvent Board considered in determining to recommend that Cvent
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Reasons for
the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Cvent Board.” In addition, in considering the
recommendation of the Cvent Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that certain of the
Company’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
the Company’s stockholders generally. See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Why am I being asked to cast an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or may
become payable to Cvent’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
The SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted rules
that require the Company to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that may be made
to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
What will happen if the Company’s stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Cvent, the Cvent Board,
Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because Cvent is contractually obligated to pay the compensation,
if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the holders of Cvent common stock and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this
advisory, non-binding vote.
What happens if I sell my shares of Cvent common stock before the Special Meeting?
The record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer your
shares of Cvent common stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote
such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person to
whom you transferred your shares. In order to receive the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, you
must hold your shares of Cvent common stock through the Effective Time. In addition, if you demand appraisal for
any of your shares of Cvent common stock, you will lose your right to appraisal with respect to any such shares that
you thereafter sell or transfer prior to the Effective Time.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Cvent common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.”
The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Cvent common stock is called a “proxy card.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will
vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card,
you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of
the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the
Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In that case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.
If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the Internet, by
telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply envelope. You
may also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the
Special Meeting, you are encouraged to submit your vote by proxy as early as possible to ensure that your shares
will be represented. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, see the section of this
proxy statement titled “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures.”
If you are a holder of record of shares of Cvent common stock and you submit a proxy card or voting instructions
but do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of each of the
Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if my shares of Cvent common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other
nominee?
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares
of Cvent common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your
bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in “street name,” you must follow the
instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or other
nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing the voting
instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement. Without providing
those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or fail to give
voting instructions to your broker, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, the
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?
Yes. If you are a stockholder with shares of Cvent common stock registered in your name as of the record date, you
may revoke your proxy at any time prior to the time it is voted by:
•
filing with our Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;
•
properly providing a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the
Internet or telephone voting facilities described under the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Special Meeting - Voting Procedures;”
•
duly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Secretary; or
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
attending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the meeting (although attendance at
the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices at Cvent
Holding Corp., 1765 Greensboro Station Place, 7th Floor, Tysons, Virginia 22102, Attention: General Counsel and
Corporate Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting. If you want to revoke your proxy by
sending a new proxy card or an instrument revoking the proxy to the Company, you should ensure that you send
your new proxy card or instrument revoking the proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to
the Special Meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in “street name,” you must contact your bank,
broker or other nominee to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares electronically at the Special
Meeting.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or multiple
proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of Cvent common stock in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold
shares of Cvent common stock. If you are a holder of Cvent common stock of record and your shares of Cvent
common stock are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit your
proxy and/or voting instructions for each set of materials that you receive to ensure that all your shares of Cvent
common stock are voted.
If I hold my shares of Cvent common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
No. Promptly after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing shares of Cvent common stock that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be sent a letter of transmittal describing
the procedure for surrendering his, her, its or their shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. If you hold your
shares in certificated form, you will receive your cash payment after the Payment Agent receives your stock
certificates and any other documents requested in the instructions. You should not return your stock certificates with
the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the Payment Agent without a letter of
transmittal. If you hold shares of Cvent common stock in uncertificated, book-entry form, you will not be required to
deliver a stock certificate, and you will receive your cash payment after the Payment Agent receives an “agent’s
message” and any other documents requested in the instructions.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
If available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. We intend to
publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting.
All reports that Cvent files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, see the section of
this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
If the Merger is completed, holders of Cvent common stock who continuously hold shares of Cvent common stock
through the Effective Time and who do not vote such shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and
beneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such
person who beneficially own shares of Cvent common stock through the Effective Time that are not voted in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and in either case who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not
withdraw their demands, and who otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will
be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Cvent common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262
of the DGCL. This means that holders and such beneficial owners of shares of Cvent common stock are entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
their shares of Cvent common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by
the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the
fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal
proceeding). Holders and beneficial owners of Cvent common stock who wish to seek appraisal of their
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising
appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding
appraisal rights is accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section of this proxy
statement titled “Appraisal Rights.”
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
We are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect the transaction to close
mid-year 2023, pending the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and a stockholder vote in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be accurately predicted,
because the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the
conditions to Parent’s, Merger Sub’s and the Company’s respective obligations to consummate the Merger, some of
which are not within the parties’ control. According to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the
Merger will not occur prior to June 15, 2023, without the prior written consent of Parent.
What effect will the Merger have on Cvent?
If the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cvent, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will thereupon cease, and Cvent will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent. Following completion of the Merger, shares of Cvent common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, and the
registration of shares of Cvent common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
the holders of Cvent common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Cvent common stock in
connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company and stockholders will
continue to own their shares of Cvent common stock. Cvent common stock will continue to be registered under the
Exchange Act and listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Cvent
may be obligated to pay to Parent a termination fee or Parent may be obligated to pay to Cvent a termination fee, as
applicable. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Termination
Fees and Expenses.”
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance
notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the
meeting and proxy card. If your shares are held in “street name,” you will receive your proxy card or other voting
information from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will return your proxy card(s) to your bank, broker or
other nominee. You should vote on and sign each proxy card you receive as discussed above. To request that only
one copy of any of these materials be mailed to your household, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee.

affect the Company’s business and the price of Cvent common stock;

the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, (including the
receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the approval of the Company’s stockholders) in the anticipated
timeframe or at all;
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the
termination of the Merger Agreement, including in circumstances requiring the Company to pay a
termination fee;

the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transaction on the Company’s business
relationships, operating results and business generally;
•
risks that the proposed transaction disrupts the Company’s current plans and operations;

Agreement or their respective directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related

(whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions

Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis,
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or
represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is
present, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a
“street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will
have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Cvent, the Cvent Board,
Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because Cvent is contractually obligated to pay the compensation,
if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the holders of Cvent common stock and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
advisory, non-binding vote.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting
24TABLE OF CONTENTS
and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares deemed not in attendance at the
Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any
voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the
Adjournment Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the Special
Meeting.
Tabulation of Votes; Results
The Company will retain an independent party to receive and tabulate the proxies and ballots, and to serve as the
inspector of election to certify the results of the Special Meeting.

CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Voting Procedures,"Voting Procedures
Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually and regardless of the number of shares of Cvent
common stock you own, your careful consideration of, and vote on, the Merger Agreement is important and we
encourage you to vote promptly.
To ensure that your shares of Cvent common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you
promptly submit your proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, using one of the following three
methods:
•
Via the Internet. Follow the instructions for Internet voting shown on the proxy card mailed to you.
•
By Telephone. Follow the instructions for telephone voting shown on the proxy card mailed to you.
•
By Proxy Card. Complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply
envelope.
The Internet and telephone procedures for submitting proxies are designed to authenticate your identity and to allow
you to cause your shares of Cvent common stock to be voted for the matters brought before the Special Meeting as
described in this proxy statement and confirm that your proxy has been properly recorded.
Proxies submitted by telephone or via the Internet for the matters brought before the Special Meeting as described in
this proxy statement must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, May 31, 2023.
If you submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy
card by mail, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares according to your instructions. If you are a
stockholder with shares of Cvent common stock registered in your name and submit your proxy but do not direct
the persons named as proxies how to vote your shares on a proposal to be brought before the Special Meeting, the
persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal.
If a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee does
not provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the
organization that holds its shares may generally vote on “discretionary” matters but cannot vote on “non-
discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid
proxy voting upon one or more matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority or for which
voting instructions have been provided but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have
discretionary authority to vote on that matter and have not received specific voting instructions on that matter from
the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Cvent does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because
the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote
on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is
considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Cvent common stock at the
Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to
vote your shares of Cvent common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other
nominee, you must follow the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote your shares. If
you follow the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee for voting your shares, then your bank, broker or
other nominee will vote your shares according to your instructions. Under applicable rules, your bank, broker or
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
other nominee has authority to vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly
completing the voting instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement.
If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on a proposal to be brought before
the Special Meeting, your shares will not be voted on that proposal, and if you do not provide voting instructions on
any of the proposals to be brought before the Special Meeting, your shares will not be deemed to be in attendance at
the meeting.

As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, at the Special Meeting holders of Cvent common stock will consider
and vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (referred to as the “Merger Proposal”). The Merger cannot
be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of Cvent stockholders. You are
urged to carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the Merger
Agreement and the Merger, including the information set forth under the sections of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety.
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock as of the close of business on the record date.
Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to
a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such
holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Cvent is required to submit a proposal to our stockholders to approve,
on an advisory, non-binding basis, the “golden parachute” compensation payments that will or may be made by
Cvent to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This proposal, commonly known as a “say on
golden parachute” proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory, non-binding basis on the
“golden parachute” compensation payments that will or may be paid by Cvent to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger (referred to as the “Compensation Proposal”).
The “golden parachute” compensation that Cvent’s named executive officers will or may be entitled to receive from
Cvent in connection with the Merger is summarized in the table that appears in the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of
Payments and Benefits.” Such summary, in table form, includes the compensation and benefits that will or may be
paid by Cvent to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
The Cvent Board encourages you to review carefully the “golden parachute” compensation information disclosed in
this proxy statement.
The Cvent Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Cvent approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Cvent to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Quantification of Payments and Benefits table and the related narrative
disclosures.”
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Cvent common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, shares deemed not in attendance
at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide
any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Since the
vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Parent or Cvent. Accordingly, if
the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is consummated, the compensation payments that are contractually
required to be paid by Cvent to its named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of the holders of Cvent common
stock on the Compensation Proposal.
The Cvent Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of 
the advisory, non-binding Compensation Proposal.

appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, the Transaction
Committee, the Special Committee or the representatives of the Company and other parties.
The Board and the Company’s senior management periodically review the Company’s long-term strategy and
objectives in light of market and industry conditions. These reviews have included, among other things,
consideration of organic growth initiatives, acquisitions, divestitures, and potential business combination
transactions, as well as other strategic opportunities, in each case, with a view towards enhancing stockholder value.
In connection with the Company’s deSPAC transaction in late 2021, an affiliate of Blackstone made an investment in
the Company’s common stock. As a result of such investment, from time to time, Rajeev K. Aggarwal, the chief
executive officer of the Company, engaged in periodic discussions following such investment through April 2022,
with representatives of Blackstone, with whom Mr. Aggarwal had a longstanding relationship. Such individuals did
not discuss a potential transaction or any specific terms during these discussions nor were there discussions
regarding a rollover or other investment from any of the Company’s stockholders with such individuals.

other investment from any of the Company’s stockholders. The representative of Vista indicated that Blackstone
should submit a letter of interest to the Board if Blackstone desired to proceed further.
On November 13, 2022, Blackstone submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the Chairman of the Board,
based upon a review of publicly available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
the Company for a range of $8.00-$8.50 per share (the “November Proposal”), in cash, representing a 38%-47%
premium to the Company’s closing share price of $5.79 as of November 11, 2022. The November Proposal specified
that, while Blackstone would be open to discussing a potential equity rollover from the Company’s stockholders,
Blackstone did not contemplate or require any such rollover or other investment from any such stockholders.
Blackstone requested in the November Proposal that the Company engage exclusively with Blackstone regarding a
potential transaction for a period of 30 days. The November Proposal was distributed to the Board on November 14,
2022.

the context of receipt of an unsolicited acquisition proposal, and discussed certain process considerations for the
Board when responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. At the meeting, the Board considered and discussed
whether the timing was appropriate to explore a potential sale transaction, including the relative risks and benefits
thereof, with the Board focusing on, among other things, the probability of consummating a successful sale at a
compelling value and the challenges facing the industry in which the Company operates. Mr. Saroya noted that Vista
would be supportive of a transaction if it was at a compelling value that was in the best interest of all stockholders,
and that Vista would expect to be a seller only in any transaction and would not seek to roll over any of its equity
ownership or be interested in acquiring the Company, either alone or as part of a consortium. At the meeting, the
Board also authorized the Company to use an acknowledgment letter to be signed by members of the Company’s
management who became aware of and involved in the process, agreeing to (a) cooperate fully with the Board, (b)
keep all information strictly confidential, and (c) not engage in discussions with any potential buyer (or
representatives thereof) unless authorized by the Board, including with respect to such person’s equity participation,
or ongoing employment or compensation with, such potential buyer. Following this discussion, the Board decided to
engage a financial advisor to assist the Company’s management and the Board in identifying other parties that might
have interest in a strategic transaction involving the Company and to assist the Board in exploring strategic
alternatives, including continuing as a standalone company. The Board considered the Company’s existing
investment banking relationships and the qualifications and experience of those financial advisors. The Board
authorized the Company’s management to contact Qatalyst Partners, as well as one other financial advisor, and to
select a financial advisor for assistance with the exploratory process for a strategic transaction. The Board’s decision
to contact these two financial advisors was based on Qatalyst Partners’ and the other financial advisor’s
qualifications and experience advising, and familiarity with, companies operating in the same industry as the
Company. In addition, the Board determined to form an ad-hoc transaction committee of the Board (the “Transaction
Committee”) for convenience and efficiency, and not to address any potential conflicts of interest. The Board
instructed management, with the assistance of the Transaction Committee and a financial advisor, once selected, to
identify a list of parties most likely to be interested in exploring a transaction with the Company, and to conduct
outreach to such parties to gauge their interest in a potential transaction involving the Company. The Board also
instructed Mr. Aggarwal, following consultation with a financial advisor, once selected, to inform Blackstone that the
Board was reviewing the November Proposal. Further, the Board instructed the Company’s management to begin
preparing long range projections to assist with the evaluation of a potential acquisition of the Company.
Later in the day on November 17, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and the other
financial advisor.
On November 21, 2022, members of management and the Board met with representatives of each of the financial
advisors. Following those meetings, the Transaction Committee, consisting of Mr. Aggarwal, Mr. Saroya, Mr. Stahl
and Marcela Martin, held a meeting, with Board member Jim Frankola and members of the Company’s management in
attendance, and, subject to review of a relationship disclosure letter from Qatalyst Partners, determined to engage
Qatalyst Partners as the Company’s financial advisor due to Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications and experience
advising, and familiarity with, companies in the same industry as the Company. The Transaction Committee also
discussed potential bidders for the Company, taking into account relationships with potential bidders who had
expressed an interest for the Company prior to or in connection with its deSPAC transaction in 2021, and determined
to instruct Qatalyst Partners to conduct outreach to the potential bidders viewed as most likely to be interested in a
transaction involving the Company.
On November 23, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal contacted a representative of Blackstone to inform Blackstone that the Board
was reviewing the November Proposal and that Qatalyst Partners had been retained as the Company’s financial
advisor, and that future communications should be directed to Qatalyst Partners.
Between November 23 and November 29, 2022, following consultation with members of the Transaction Committee
and Company management regarding the appropriate scope and participants in the strategic process, at the direction
of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conducted outreach to eight other potential
counterparties viewed as most likely to be interested in a transaction involving the Company, including four strategic
counterparties and four financial sponsors (including Party A and a financial sponsor, which we refer to herein as
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Party B”). All of these potential counterparties other than Party A and Party B either informed representatives of
Qatalyst Partners that they were not interested in a potential acquisition of the Company citing other strategic
priorities and/or a lack of familiarity with the Company or determined not to engage following such outreach. Party A
and Party B each informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were interested in a potential acquisition of
the Company. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners instructed each of Party A and Party B to submit a preliminary
indication of interest to the Board based on publicly available information.
On November 27, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners held an introductory call with representatives of
Blackstone.
On November 29, 2022, Qatalyst Partners delivered its relationship disclosure letter to the Board.
On November 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, the Board ratified the formation of the Transaction
Committee with Mr. Saroya, Mr. Stahl, Ms. Martin and Mr. Aggarwal as the members. The Board authorized the
Transaction Committee to assist management with respect to negotiating a possible transaction and to provide timely
Board input on issues as they arose; provided that any potential transaction involving the Company would need to
be approved by the full Board. Also at the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on the
process undertaken by the Company to date, including discussions with Blackstone regarding the November
Proposal, and Qatalyst Partners’ targeted outreach to other parties selected by the Transaction Committee based on
their potential interest in the Company and their ability to complete a transaction of this kind. At the meeting, given
that certain parties contacted had passed on the opportunity or were viewed by the Board as unlikely to be able to
proceed with a potential transaction, the Board instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to conduct outreach
to two additional financial sponsors, which we refer to herein as “Party C” and “Party D,” who were viewed as the
next most likely parties to be interested in a transaction involving the Company. Representatives of Kirkland also
reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in the context of evaluating the November
Proposal and other strategic alternatives, including continuing as a standalone company. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners also reviewed with the Board certain preliminary financial analyses with respect to the November Proposal.
The Board members concluded that, based on the then-existing facts and circumstances, the Board would seek to
transact at a higher value than as proposed in the November Proposal, and also discussed the response to the
November Proposal (including that the Company would not agree to Blackstone’s request for exclusivity). The Board
agreed, and directed Qatalyst Partners, to convey the Board’s view with respect to the November Proposal to
Blackstone and to continue engaging with Blackstone and with other potential parties to gauge interest. The Board
also determined to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Blackstone in order to provide Blackstone with non-
public information to facilitate preliminary diligence to support an increased offer. After representatives of Qatalyst
Partners left the meeting, the Board also reviewed Qatalyst Partners’ relationship disclosure letter and determined
that, based on the letter, it believed that Qatalyst Partners did not have any conflicts that would affect the ability of
Qatalyst Partners to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to the Board.
Also on November 30, 2022, Party B called representatives of Qatalyst Partners to communicate that, based upon a
review of publicly available information, if it were to submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of the Company, such proposal would be in a range of $7.00-$7.25 per share (the “Party B Indication”),
in cash, representing a 32%-37% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $5.29 as of November 29, 2022. The
Party B Indication did not contemplate terms regarding a rollover or other investment from any of the Company’s
stockholders.
On December 1 and 2, 2022, following consultation with and at the direction of the Transaction Committee,
representatives of Qatalyst Partners and the Company’s management informed representatives of Party B that the
proposed value in the Party B Indication was below a value at which the Company sought to transact and that Party
B would need to improve its view on valuation in order to receive access to non-public information and continue with
discussions. Party B agreed to discuss internally and would revert if it was able to improve its view on valuation.
Party B did not respond with an improved proposal following such discussion.
On December 2, 2022, as directed by the Board, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to representatives of
Blackstone to communicate that the Board was seeking to transact at a higher value than as proposed in the
November Proposal and to outline the process for Blackstone to gain access to non-public information, complete
their preliminary diligence and submit an improved proposal.
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Between December 2 and December 4, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conducted outreach to Party C and
Party D, as directed by the Board. Party D informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was not interested in a
potential acquisition of the Company due to lack of historical focus on the event management space. Party C
informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was interested in a potential acquisition of the Company.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners instructed Party C to submit a preliminary indication of interest to the Board
based on publicly available information.
On December 3, 2022, representatives of Blackstone submitted a request to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to
commence discussions with a limited group of lenders in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company,
which request was promptly passed along to the Company’s management and the Board.
On December 5, 2022, Party A submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the Board, based upon a review of
publicly available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $7.60 per
share (the “Party A Proposal”), in cash, representing a 38% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $5.51 as
of December 2, 2022. The Party A Proposal did not contemplate terms regarding a rollover or other investment from
any of the Company’s stockholders. The Party A Proposal also indicated that, based upon certain assumptions
regarding the availability of debt financing, Party A would need to find a partner to underwrite approximately $700
million of additional equity capital prior to the signing of definitive transaction documents. The Party A Proposal was
promptly distributed to the Board for review.
On December 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board
on the process undertaken by the Company to date, including discussions with each of Blackstone and Party A
regarding the November Proposal and the Party A Proposal, respectively. The Board instructed the Company’s
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners to continue engaging with Blackstone. Further, the Board
determined to allow Blackstone to commence discussions with a limited group of lenders (but only those affiliated
with Blackstone) in response to Blackstone’s request on December 3, 2022, so long as such lenders were bound by
confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as the confidentiality agreement to be entered into by Blackstone and
the Company, which determination the Board instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to convey to
Blackstone. The Board also determined that the Party A Proposal was sufficiently below a value at which the
Company sought to transact such that Party A should not be granted access to non-public information without
improving its price per share based on publicly available information. The Board instructed representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to communicate this message to representatives of Party A.
Also at the meeting, the Company’s management presented the December Projections (as defined below in the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”), a new set of three-year long-
range projections prepared by management at the request of the Board in connection with the evaluation of a
potential acquisition of the Company, as well as a comparison of the December Projections with the Company’s long
range projection model from the time of the Company’s deSPAC transaction in 2021. The Board then approved the
December Projections (i) for sharing with Blackstone and any other interested parties who had submitted sufficient
indications of interest and entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company, which, in each case, were
promptly shared at such time as each of the interested parties was given access to the virtual data room, and (ii) for
use by Qatalyst Partners for purposes of preparing financial analyses in connection with the Board’s evaluation of
any potential strategic transaction, which were promptly shared with Qatalyst Partners.
After the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed the Board-directed messages to each of Blackstone
and Party A.
On December 7, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Blackstone. The confidentiality
agreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited
Blackstone (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and
from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate
the standstill provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement
permitted Blackstone to make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement
with a third party providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also
prohibited Blackstone from entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source and no
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
approval for Blackstone to enter into any such arrangement was ever provided by the Company. This agreement also
prohibited Blackstone from having discussions with the Company’s management team regarding an equity rollover or
any post-transaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board.
Also on December 7, 2022, Blackstone submitted a request to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to commence
discussions with a limited group of potential equity co-investors.
Also on December 7, 2022, representatives of Blackstone, a representative of Qatalyst Partners and the Company’s
management met in person to discuss Blackstone’s continued interest in acquiring the Company. No terms of a
potential transaction (including terms regarding rollover or other investment from any of the Company’s
stockholders, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with, or compensation to be paid by,
Blackstone or any of its affiliates) were discussed.
On December 8, 2022, the Company’s management gave an in-person Company overview presentation to
representatives of Blackstone, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.
Between December 8, 2022 and January 19, 2023, Blackstone completed its preliminary diligence, which included
meetings with the Company’s management and access to a virtual data room.
On December 9, 2022, representatives of Blackstone were granted access to a virtual data room.
On December 11, 2022, at the direction of Company management in consultation with members of the Transaction
Committee, Blackstone was granted permission to engage with two potential equity co-investors.
On December 12, 2022, the Company and Qatalyst Partners executed an engagement letter for Qatalyst Partners to
serve as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction.
On December 15, 2022, Party A submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest to the Board, based upon
publicly available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $8.00-
$8.25 per share (the “Revised Party A Proposal”), in cash, representing a 40%-44% premium to the Company’s closing
share price of $5.71 as of December 14, 2022. The Revised Party A Proposal did not contemplate terms regarding a
rollover or other investment from any of the Company’s stockholders. The Revised Party A Proposal indicated that
based upon certain assumptions regarding the availability of debt financing, Party A would need to find a partner to
underwrite approximately $1.1 billion of additional equity capital prior to the signing of definitive transaction
documents. The Revised Party A Proposal was promptly distributed to the Board for review.
Later on December 15, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with Mr. Frankola, members of the Company’s
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of
Qatalyst Partners updated the Transaction Committee on the process undertaken by the Company to date, including
developments with each of Blackstone and Party A regarding the November Proposal and the Revised Party A
Proposal, respectively. The Transaction Committee instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to continue
permitting Blackstone to conduct due diligence to allow it to propose an improved price per share, and to inform
Party A that while the Revised Party A Proposal was below the value range at which the Company would transact, it
would be allowed to access non-public information in order to complete its preliminary diligence and provide an
improved price per share.
On December 16, 2022, Mr. Aggarwal received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor (which we refer to herein
as “Party E”) concerning potential interest in an acquisition of the Company. Party E indicated that it had heard
rumors regarding a potential transaction. Party E’s interest was discussed with the Company’s management, the
Transaction Committee, and representatives of Qatalyst Partners. The Transaction Committee determined that the
engagement with Party E was not warranted based on the lack of specifics included in its stated interest in a potential
transaction involving the Company and the fact that its fund size would likely not support an acquisition of the
Company at an attractive valuation. Party E did not submit a proposal to acquire the Company or otherwise follow up
or further pursue any engagement with the Company regarding a potential transaction.
On December 18, 2022, the Company and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality
agreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited Party
A (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and from
taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate the
standstill provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted
Party A to make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a third
party
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also prohibited Party A
from entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source. The Company did not approve
any such exclusivity or lock-up arrangements for financing sources for Party A. This agreement also prohibited Party
A from having discussions with the Company’s management team regarding an equity rollover or any post-
transaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board. Following execution
of the confidentiality agreement, Party A was provided access to due diligence information in the virtual data room.
On December 19, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor
(which we refer to herein as “Party F”) indicating that Party F had heard rumors regarding a potential transaction.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners relayed news of the inbound inquiry to Mr. Saroya. Following consultation with
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, the Transaction Committee determined that engagement with Party F was not
warranted based on its fund size not being able to support an acquisition of the Company at an attractive valuation,
its indication that it would not be able to lead any potential transaction of the Company, and the lack of specifics
concerning its interest in a potential transaction involving the Company.
On December 21, 2022, Party C contacted Mr. Saroya and indicated that, on a preliminary basis and based upon
publicly available information, it was valuing the common stock of the Company at a price of approximately $6.50 per
share. As previously determined by the Board, Mr. Saroya communicated to Party C that the indicated price was
insufficient and that if it wanted to continue in discussions with the Company regarding a potential acquisition it
would need to meaningfully improve its price. Party C did not follow up on this conversation.
On December 21 and 23, 2022, the Company’s management gave a presentation to representatives of Party A
regarding the Company, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.
On December 29, 2022, representatives of Blackstone and Mr. Aggarwal had an in-person meeting to discuss
Blackstone’s continued interest in acquiring the Company, the Company’s business and the December Projections.
No terms of a potential transaction (including terms regarding rollover or other investment from any of the
Company’s stockholders or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with, or compensation to
be paid by, Blackstone or any of its affiliates) were discussed.
On December 30, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor
(which we refer to herein as “Party G”) who had indicated that it had heard rumors regarding a potential transaction
and wished to relay its potential interest in a possible acquisition of the Company.
On December 31, 2022, representatives of Party G informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Party G intended
to submit a formal indication of interest with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company.
On January 4, 2023, Party G submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the Board, based upon publicly
available information, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $10.00 per share
(the “Party G Proposal”), in cash, representing an 87% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $5.34 as of
January 3, 2023. The Party G Proposal did not contemplate terms regarding a rollover or other investment from any of
the Company’s stockholders. Party G also indicated that it would not need a partner to complete a potential
transaction. The Party G Proposal was promptly distributed to the Board for review.
On January 6, 2023, the Company’s management circulated to the Board the January Projections (as defined below in
the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”), which expanded the
December Projections to include financial forecasts, including an estimate of free cash flows, through calendar year
2028, and the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”), which included a free cash flow projection for each quarter of fiscal
year 2023. The January Projections were approved by the Board for use by Qatalyst Partners for purposes of
providing financial analyses in connection with the Board’s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction and the
Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections were approved by the Board and subsequently shared with Blackstone
(but no other potential bidders) in response to a diligence request from Blackstone for such information. For
additional information with respect to the January Projections and the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections, see
the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Certain Financial Projections.”
Also on January 6, 2023, the Company and Party G entered into a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality
agreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited Party
G (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and from
taking
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate the standstill
provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Party G to
make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a third party
providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also prohibited Party G
from entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source. This agreement also prohibited
Party G from having discussions with the Company’s management team regarding an equity rollover or any post-
transaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board. The Company did
not approve any such exclusivity or lock-up arrangements for financing sources for Party G. Following execution of
the confidentiality agreement, Party G was provided access to due diligence information in the virtual data room on
January 9, 2023.
On January 7, 2023, representatives of Blackstone and Mr. Aggarwal, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in
attendance, had a meeting to discuss Blackstone’s continued interest in acquiring the Company and certain of
Blackstone’s diligence findings to date regarding opportunities for operational improvements at the Company. No
terms of a potential transaction (including terms regarding rollover or other investment from any of the Company’s
stockholders, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with, or compensation to be paid by,
Blackstone or any of its affiliates) were discussed.
On January 18 and 20, 2023, the Company’s management gave presentations to representatives of Party G regarding
the Company, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.
On January 18, 2023, representatives of a financial sponsor (which we refer to herein as “Party H”) contacted the
Company’s management concerning Party H’s potential interest in the event management space generally, as well as
a potential transaction with the Company.
On January 19, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Party H and indicated that if it
had interest in a potential transaction involving the Company, it should submit a proposal based on public
information. Representatives of Party H informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Party H would consider
whether this was an opportunity it wanted to pursue. No further communication was received from Party H following
such discussion.
Also on January 19, 2023, representatives of Blackstone contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to indicate
that its business diligence was substantially complete and that it remained interested in a potential acquisition of the
Company. The Blackstone representatives noted that both of the potential equity co-investors with whom Blackstone
had been permitted to engage had determined not to proceed, and it had not been permitted to contact debt financing
sources (except for the limited group affiliated with Blackstone as previously approved by the Board). Blackstone
requested permission to move forward with confirmatory due diligence, and for permission to contact additional debt
and equity financing sources and indicated that Blackstone could complete confirmatory diligence in three to four
weeks. Blackstone indicated that this would allow it to put forward its best view on value and that it understood the
Company’s expectation that any proposal would be above the high end of its previously indicated range.
On January 20, 2023, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with Mr. Frankola, members of the Company’s
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, the Transaction
Committee discussed the indications of interest received by the Company to date, that Blackstone had shown the
most engagement in a potential acquisition of the Company and that other bidders generally appeared to lack similar
conviction and interest in the underlying business of the Company. The Transaction Committee discussed
Blackstone’s request to engage with additional potential equity and debt financing sources, including that providing
Blackstone with an ability to engage with additional financing sources could facilitate Blackstone’s ability to submit a
bid that was at a compelling value and approved Blackstone’s engagement of a limited list of additional potential debt
and equity financing sources. The Transaction Committee also discussed the Party G Proposal, including the fact that
the Party G Proposal would represent a large portion of Party G’s available funds, and, as a result, concerns that the
Party G Proposal was not a viable offer, but given Party G’s initial value indication, the Company had entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Party G and provided representatives of Party G with diligence information and a
management presentation. Representatives of Kirkland discussed the status and key terms of an initial auction draft
of the Merger Agreement, and the Transaction Committee instructed representatives of Kirkland to deliver a draft of
the Merger Agreement to Blackstone’s and any other remaining participant’s outside legal advisor at the appropriate
time.
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 24, 2023, representatives of Party G communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners Party G’s
inability to further proceed in a potential acquisition of the Company, noting that Party G had determined that it had
overestimated the opportunity for operational improvements to the Company.
On January 29, 2023, at the request of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Kirkland delivered to
representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), Blackstone’s outside legal advisor, a draft
of the Merger Agreement.
On January 30, 2023, the Company’s management gave a presentation to representatives of Party A regarding the
Company’s sales organization and go-to-market strategy, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance.
On January 31, 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Company was exploring a potential sale, identifying
Blackstone as a potential bidder (the “WSJ Article”).
Following the publication of the WSJ Article, on January 31, 2023 and February 1, 2023, Mr. Aggarwal received
inbound communications from representatives of two different venture capital and equity investment firms (which we
refer to herein as “Party I” and “Party J”). The email from Party I requested a brief introductory call with Mr. Aggarwal
to establish a relationship but did not indicate that Party I was interested in pursuing, or capable of completing, a
potential acquisition of the Company. Mr. Aggarwal and the representative of Party I did not have an introductory
call and the representative of Party I did not contact Mr. Aggarwal or the Company again following such initial
outreach. The representative of Party J referenced the WSJ Article to Mr. Aggarwal and noted that, while Party J did
not have the financial capacity to acquire the Company, Party J would potentially be interested in participating as an
additional equity financing source in an acquisition of the Company by a third party. Mr. Aggarwal noted the
inbound communications from Party I and Party J to the Chairman of the Board.
On February 1, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from representatives of a
financial sponsor (which we refer to herein as “Party K”), who expressed an interest in acquiring the Company and a
desire to move quickly. After discussions with and obtaining approval from members of the Transaction Committee,
and in light of the view that Party K was a highly credible bidder based on its ability to move quickly, its fund size
and its strong track record of consummating transactions in the industry, Qatalyst Partners offered to provide Party K
with preliminary due diligence information, subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement.
Also on February 1, 2023, at the direction of the members of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Qatalyst
Partners requested that Blackstone provide a final proposal on value on February 17, 2023, including a Merger
Agreement in a form that it would be prepared to execute as well as executable equity and debt commitment letters.
Qatalyst noted that Kirkland would be available to engage with Simpson Thacher in advance of this date.
Also on February 1, 2023, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided Party A an
initial draft of the Merger Agreement via the virtual data room.
On February 3, 2023, the Company and Party K entered into a confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality
agreement includes customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that prohibited Party
K (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the Company, and from
taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies and making any request to amend, waive or terminate the
standstill provision, in each case, without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted
Party K to make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company entered into a definitive agreement with a third
party providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. The confidentiality agreement also prohibited
Party K from entering into any exclusivity or lock-up arrangement with any financing source. The Company did not
approve any such exclusivity or lock-up arrangements for financing sources for Party K. This agreement also
prohibited Party K from having discussions with the Company’s management team regarding an equity rollover or
any post-transaction employment or compensation matters without the prior written consent of the Board. Following
execution of the confidentiality agreement, Party K was provided access to select due diligence information in the
virtual data room on February 3, 2023.
Also on February 3, 2023, representatives of Blackstone and Mr. Aggarwal, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners
in attendance, discussed Blackstone’s continued interest in acquiring the Company, the diligence process undertaken
by Blackstone to date, as well as its outreach to potential financing sources. No terms regarding a rollover or other
investment from any of the Company’s stockholders, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other
person with, or compensation to be paid by, Blackstone or any of its affiliates were discussed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on February 3, 2023, a representative of Party A reached out to a representative of Qatalyst Partners and
indicated that Party A remained interested in a potential transaction but, based on its business due diligence to date,
that it would be unable to improve the purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal, and that, in any case,
it would require a partner to be able to complete an acquisition of the Company. Party A did not make a request to
contact any potential partners or financing sources.
On February 4, 2023, representatives of Simpson Thacher delivered to representatives of Kirkland a revised draft of
the Merger Agreement, which draft included a request that certain members of Company management enter into
Voting Agreements in addition to the Vista Stockholders.
On February 7, 2023, the Company’s management and representatives of Party K, with representatives of Qatalyst
Partners in attendance, held an initial diligence meeting.
On February 8, 2023, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners to request
permission to contact Blackstone regarding a potential acquisition of the Company referencing published speculation
that Blackstone was contemplating a potential transaction with the Company. This request was discussed with
management of the Company and the Transaction Committee and denied the following day, taking into account,
among other things, the fact that (1) Party A had indicated that, based on its business due diligence to date, it would
not be able to improve upon the purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal (which was below the high
end of the valuation range in Blackstone’s November Proposal), (2) Blackstone had already substantially completed
confirmatory diligence and acknowledged the Company’s expectation that any potential revised proposal it submitted
would need to be above the high end of the valuation range in its November Proposal, and (3) Blackstone had not
requested to partner with a co-bidder in the transaction.
On February 11, 2023, representatives of Party K indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Party K was no
longer interested in pursuing an acquisition of the Company.
On February 12, 2023, the Company’s management circulated to the Board the Updated Free Cash Flow Projections
(as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”), which
reflected updates to the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections and the February Projections (as defined below in
the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”), which reflected updates to
the January Projections, in each case, to reflect refined assumptions with respect to projected cash taxes and the
impact of such refined assumptions on the Company and its free cash flow (for additional information with respect to
the Updated Free Cash Flow Projections and the February Projections, see the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”). The Updated Free Cash Flow Projections were approved by the
Board and, on the following day, were shared with Blackstone (and no other potential bidders). The February
Projections were approved by the Board for use and reliance by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its financial
analyses and in connection with its opinion to the Board.
On February 14, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher a revised draft of
the Merger Agreement.
Also on February 14, 2023, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners to express
Party A’s continued interest in a potential transaction involving the Company but noted that its previously
communicated constraints regarding price and ability to consummate a transaction on its own remained the same.
On February 15, 2023, Blackstone communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that its proposal likely would
not be sent to the Company until February 21, 2023. Blackstone confirmed that it understood the expectation to
deliver a fully-financed offer with a revised Merger Agreement as previously had been communicated by
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, and Blackstone did not request any rollover from any existing Company
stockholders.
On February 17, 2023, representatives of Blackstone informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Mr. Aggarwal
that Blackstone’s Investment Committee was reviewing the terms of a potential acquisition of the Company.
Also on February 17, 2023, representatives of Blackstone had a call with Mr. Aggarwal and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to discuss certain diligence questions of Blackstone to prepare for the call scheduled for February
19, 2023.
On February 19, 2023, representatives of Blackstone, including certain members of Blackstone’s Investment
Committee, and Mr. Aggarwal, with a representative of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, discussed the Company’s
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
financial projections and its ability to deliver operational improvement. No terms regarding a rollover or other
investment from any Company stockholder, or the employment or service of Mr. Aggarwal or any other person with,
or compensation to be paid by, Blackstone or any of its affiliates, were discussed.
On February 21, 2023, Blackstone submitted a “best and final” non-binding indication of interest to the Board to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $8.00 per share (the “February 21
Proposal”), representing a 22% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $6.57 as of January 30, 2023, the last
trading day before the WSJ Article regarding a potential sale of the Company (the “January 30 Price”), together with
revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Company disclosure letter, as well as initial drafts of the Equity
Commitment Letter, Limited Guarantee and a Debt Commitment Letter that contemplated debt financing of $900
million. The February 21 Proposal stated that the $8.00 per share price was a 54% premium to the closing share price
of $5.21 as of January 6, 2023, the last trading day prior to a decoupling of the Company’s trading patterns in advance
of the WSJ Article observed by Blackstone. The February 21 Proposal was contingent on the Vista Stockholders
“rolling” a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them, valued at $1.0 billion (based on the $8.00
per share price in the February 21 Proposal) into common equity of the post-closing company in connection with a
potential sale of the Company, in order to address a gap in the requisite financing (due to equity financing sources
deciding they were not interested in proceeding with the transaction) for Blackstone to make an offer for the
Company at a value that Blackstone believed would be of interest to the Board. The February 21 Proposal further
contemplated that Blackstone and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (“ADIA”)
would provide a common equity and convertible preferred equity investment, which would be senior to Vista’s
“rolled” equity, to help finance the acquisition of the Company. The February 21 Proposal also included a request to
initiate discussions regarding potential rollovers and other post-closing arrangements with certain members of the
Company’s management, subject to approval by an independent special committee of the Board of non-management
directors that are independent of Vista. The February 21 Proposal was promptly distributed to the Board for review.
Also on February 21, 2023, Qatalyst Partners delivered an updated relationship disclosure letter to the Board.
On February 22, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Blackstone discussed the terms of the February 21
Proposal, and representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed that the price was lower than had been expected and
that the request for a rollover from the Vista Stockholders to bridge a financing gap was a new and unexpected
request based on Blackstone’s previously conveyed expectations that sufficient financing would be available.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed that the February 21 Proposal would be discussed with the Board
but, based on prior Board direction, was unlikely to result in any further engagement or a counterproposal.
On February 23, 2023, representatives of Blackstone orally submitted a revised proposal to representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $8.10 per share (the
“February 23 Proposal”), representing a 23% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders
“rolling” a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them into common equity of the post-closing
company, valued at $1.0 billion (based on the $8.10 per share price in the February 23 Proposal). The February 23
Proposal no longer contemplated a convertible preferred equity investment from Blackstone and a wholly owned
subsidiary of ADIA that would be senior to Vista’s “rolled” equity. The February 23 Proposal was promptly
distributed to the Board for review.
On February 24, 2023, Reuters reported that the Company had rejected a $3.9 billion acquisition offer from Blackstone.
On February 27, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, the Board reviewed discussions with Blackstone to
date, including with respect to the February 21 Proposal and the February 23 Proposal. At such meeting,
representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the February 23 Proposal from a financial point of view.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the current state of the financial markets, including current market
valuation for similar companies, market volatility, high interest rates, constraints around availability of financing, and
inflationary pressures. The Board also discussed market conditions generally, including a potential recession and
possible macroeconomic challenges facing the Company.
At the meeting, the Board also discussed the fact that the February 23 Proposal was contingent on the Vista
Stockholders “rolling” a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them into common equity of the
post-closing company. Mr. Saroya reiterated that Vista’s preference was to sell all of its shares of Company
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
common stock for cash. However, he noted that if a rollover by Vista of a portion of its shares of Company common
stock could be leveraged to obtain a higher price for the benefit of all of the Company’s stockholders, Vista was
willing to entertain a discussion of a partial rollover. Mr. Saroya noted that, at this point in time, Vista’s interest was
aligned with the Company’s other stockholders, which was to maximize value for all stockholders. Representatives of
Kirkland discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties and the potential benefits of creating a special committee if the
Board determined to proceed with a proposal that involved a potential rollover by Vista. After discussion, the Board
determined, with Vista’s support, to submit a counteroffer at $9.00 per share, with Vista agreeing to reinvest $1.0
billion of its shares into a non-convertible preferred equity instrument with market terms to be separately negotiated
between Vista and Blackstone. The Board determined that if Blackstone accepted the Company’s offer, it would
establish a special committee of independent directors to evaluate the terms of any potential transaction in light of a
reinvestment by Vista or the Vista Stockholders. After the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed the
Board-directed message to representatives of Blackstone. The Board also reviewed Qatalyst Partners’ updated
relationship disclosure letter and determined that, based on the letter, it continued to believe that Qatalyst Partners
did not have any conflicts that would affect the ability of Qatalyst Partners to fulfill its responsibilities as financial
advisor to the Board.
Immediately following the completion of the Board meeting, representatives of Kirkland met with Mr. Frankola and
Ms. Martin, the members of the Board who were independent and disinterested relative to Vista, Blackstone and the
Company’s management, to discuss process generally and certain potential procedural safeguards, including
potentially creating a special committee of independent and disinterested members of the Board, that could be taken
by the independent and disinterested members of the Board in the context of a potential rollover by Vista, and
provided an overview of the Board’s (including the independent directors’) fiduciary duties in the context of a
potential transaction.
On March 1, 2023, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners with ongoing interest
but reaffirmed that its previously communicated constraints regarding price and ability to consummate a transaction
on its own remained unchanged. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners relayed this interaction to the Transaction
Committee and noted that (1) Party A stated that, based on its business due diligence, it was unable to improve the
$8.00-$8.25 per share purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal, and (2) Party A had not engaged in
other steps necessary to consummate a transaction, including, among other things, requesting access to begin
confirmatory diligence and providing any comments to the draft Merger Agreement. Based on these considerations,
the Transaction Committee determined that engagement with Party A was not warranted.
On March 4, 2023, representatives of Blackstone orally submitted a proposal to representatives of Qatalyst Partners
(the “March 4 Proposal”), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for either (a)
$8.20 per share, representing a 25% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders “rolling” a
portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by them into common equity of the post-closing company,
valued at at least $1.0 billion, with Blackstone noting that it would be open to a larger rollover that would result in
Vista and Blackstone each owning an equal stake of the combined company, or (b) $8.50 per share, representing a
29% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders investing $1.25 billion of the proceeds
received from shares of Company common stock owned by them as non-convertible preferred equity of the post-
closing company at an approximately 10.0% payment-in-kind interest rate (as described in clause (b), the “Vista
Preferred Financing”), which was viewed by Blackstone as a below-market rate for such a security. Representatives of
Blackstone also orally indicated that if the Company was willing to agree to a delayed close until the end of
November to facilitate a 45-day marketing period commencing after the third quarter of 2023, based on the third
quarter results of the Company, Blackstone would be potentially willing to increase its price per share offered in either
clause (a) or (b) above by $0.15 to $0.20 or if no other proposal was acceptable, Blackstone would consider
alternative transaction structures, including investing in the Company through a PIPE and having the Company
conduct a self-tender offer with the proceeds.
Also on March 4, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the terms of the March 4
Proposal. Mr. Stahl informed the Board that, although Vista’s preference was to sell all of its shares for cash, it was
willing to consider providing the non-convertible preferred financing in order to obtain a higher per share price for
the benefit of all common stockholders, even though it viewed the interest rate proposed by Blackstone as
significantly below market. At the meeting, the Board discussed the March 4 Proposal, including the terms of the
Vista Preferred Financing, and determined to submit a counterproposal to Blackstone of $8.75 per share,
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contemplating that the Vista Stockholders would “roll” a portion of the shares of Company common stock owned by
them into non-convertible preferred equity of the post-closing company, valued at $1.25 billion (based on such $8.75
per share price), consistent with the Vista Preferred Financing construct. Vista informed the Board that it would be
willing to consider providing the Vista Preferred Financing, subject to the negotiation of acceptable terms to Vista,
and the eventual approval of an independent special committee of the Board, including a higher payment-in-kind
interest rate, and indicated that 13.5% payment-in-kind interest rate would be acceptable. Following such indication
from Vista, the Board determined to include in the counterproposal to Blackstone discussed above the Vista Preferred
Financing with a payment-in-kind interest rate of 13.5%. The Board also discussed Blackstone’s proposed alternative
transaction structures and delayed closing timing and determined that the Board’s counterproposal to the March 4
Proposal would provide the most deal certainty for the Company’s stockholders. After the meeting, representatives
of Qatalyst Partners conveyed the Board-directed message to representatives of Blackstone.
Between March 4 and 6, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, at the direction of the Board, discussed with
representatives of Blackstone the terms of the March 4 Proposal as well as the Board’s counterproposal. Blackstone
noted that, with respect to the Vista Preferred Financing, it would not be able to provide a payment-in-kind interest
rate higher than 10.5% per annum and that, other than the increase in the payment-in-kind interest rate from 10.0% to
10.5% per annum, the terms set forth in the March 4 Proposal represented Blackstone’s “best and final” proposal.
On March 6, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on the
discussions with Blackstone after the previous meeting, including Blackstone’s position that the March 4 Proposal
was its “best and final” and that it would not be willing to provide a payment-in-kind interest rate on the Vista
Preferred Financing higher than 10.5% per annum. The Board discussed the March 4 Proposal, including the terms of
the Vista Preferred Financing. During the Board’s discussion, Mr. Stahl indicated that Vista would be willing to
consider proceeding with a transaction structure that included the Vista Preferred Financing, even though Vista
believed that the interest rate of up to 10.5% offered by Blackstone was below market. At the meeting, Vista indicated
it was supportive of a transaction at $8.50 per share and stated that if the Board determined to move forward on these
terms, it would be prepared to engage with Blackstone to negotiate terms of a preferred instrument in order to
facilitate a transaction (at the interest rate proposed). After discussion, the Board determined to proceed with
discussions relating to Blackstone’s offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company
for $8.50 per share, representing a 29% premium to the January 30 Price, contingent on the Vista Stockholders
investing $1.25 billion of the proceeds received from shares of Company common stock owned by them as non-
convertible preferred equity of the post-closing company at a 10.5% per annum payment-in-kind interest rate. The
Board did not assess whether the Vista Preferred Financing was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Vista
Stockholders.
At the same meeting, the Board determined to form the Special Committee to (a) review and evaluate a potential sale
of the Company, including the Vista Preferred Financing, (b) make such investigation of a potential sale of the
Company and any alternatives thereto (including remaining an independent company) as it, in its sole discretion,
deems advisable or appropriate, (c) if the Special Committee considers it advisable or appropriate, review and provide
input with respect to the price, structure, form, terms and conditions of a potential sale of the Company or any
alternative thereto and the form, terms and conditions of any definitive agreements in connection therewith, (d)
determine whether a potential sale of the Company or any alternative thereto is advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (e) obtain any necessary or desirable advice, assistance and opinions
from financial advisors, legal counsel or other advisors, consultants and agents, (f) recommend to the full Board what
action, if any, should be taken by the Company with respect to a potential sale of the Company that includes or
contemplates the Vista Preferred Financing, and (g) provide reports or recommendations to the Board in regard to a
potential sale of the Company at such times as the Special Committee deems appropriate and consistent with its
activities. The Board also determined that (i) the Special Committee would not have the power to cause the Company
to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, definitive agreement to effect, or other agreement
binding or committing the Company to the terms of a potential sale of the Company or any alternative thereto, which
powers and authority remained vested exclusively in the Board, and (ii) the Board would not approve or recommend a
potential transaction that involved the Vista Preferred Financing without a prior favorable recommendation of the
Special Committee. After discussion at the meeting, the Board determined that each of Mr. Frankola and Ms. Martin
were independent and disinterested for purposes of a possible sale of the Company, including in the case of a
transaction including the Vista Preferred Financing, and appointed them to the Special Committee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Immediately following the completion of the Board meeting, the Special Committee held a meeting with
representatives of Kirkland in attendance to discuss the retention of independent legal and financial advisors to
advise the Special Committee. The Special Committee determined to contact Goodwin Procter LLP (“Goodwin”) to
determine whether Goodwin was available to serve as the Special Committee’s independent legal advisor, on the basis
of Goodwin’s extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates and experience advising
software and technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions.
Beginning on March 6, 2023 until the signing of the Merger Agreement, and with the approval of the Special
Committee at the meeting on March 7, 2023, representatives of Blackstone and representatives of Vista negotiated the
terms of the Vista Preferred Financing.
Also on March 6, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher initial drafts of
the Preferred Term Sheet in connection with the Vista Preferred Financing and the Voting Agreement for the Vista
Stockholders as requested by Blackstone. The draft Preferred Term Sheet delivered by representatives of Kirkland
contemplated, among other terms, an initial 10.5% payment-in-kind interest, which rate would be increased by 1.0
percentage point per annum beginning on the fifth anniversary of the closing date and 2.0 percentage points per
annum beginning on the tenth anniversary of the closing date or upon the occurrence of certain noncompliance
events. The draft Preferred Term Sheet also contemplated that the issuer would be required to repurchase the
preferred shares for cash in the case of certain mandatory redemption events and that the holders of the preferred
shares would be entitled to designate one member to the issuer’s board of directors.
Between March 6, 2023 and March 14, 2023, representatives of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher exchanged drafts and
negotiated the terms of the Preferred Term Sheet and the Voting Agreement for the Vista Stockholders, and conducted
a number of conference calls regarding the drafts of such agreements. Among other items in the draft Preferred Term
Sheet, the parties negotiated circumstances in which the interest rate would be increased, optional and mandatory
redemption rights (including, at the request of Blackstone, the right of the issuer to elect to repurchase the preferred
shares for equity in the case of certain mandatory redemption events), transferability of the preferred shares, consent,
board, exit-demand and registration rights. The final Preferred Term Sheet negotiated by the parties reflected the
following terms: (a) an initial 10.5% payment-in-kind interest rate, which rate will increase by 0.75% per annum
beginning on the eighth anniversary of the closing date, subject to a maximum rate of 15.0% per annum (the
“Maximum Rate”); (b) the right of the issuer to redeem the preferred shares prior to the second anniversary of the
closing date, for cash at a make-whole redemption price, or on and after the second anniversary of the closing date,
based on the redemption prices set forth in the Preferred Commitment Letter, decreasing ratably to par for any
redemption occurring after the fourth anniversary of the closing date; (c) the right of the holders of the preferred
shares, upon the occurrence of certain change of control events or upon an initial public offering (“IPO”) (each, a
“Mandatory Redemption Event”), to require the issuer to repurchase the preferred shares at the applicable
redemption price for cash, or in certain circumstances and at the election of the issuer, an equivalent number of
shares of the acquiring company or shares of the publicly traded entity listed in such IPO; (d) in the case of a
Mandatory Redemption Event in which the holders of common stock of the issuer would achieve a gross internal rate
of return (“IRR”) of 20% or greater, the obligation of the issuer to make a “catch up” payment to each holder of
preferred shares in an amount equal to (x) the amount of dividends that would have accrued on the preferred shares
assuming an initial interest rate of 12.5% minus (y) any make-whole amount or redemption premium to be paid to a
holder of a preferred share in connection with such Mandatory Redemption Event (which “catch up” payment is
subject to reduction to the extent necessary to cause the IRR to not be less than 20% after giving effect to such
payment); (e) beginning on the tenth anniversary of the closing date, the right of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding preferred shares to demand the issuer to engage in a process to effect either an IPO or a sale of the
issuer (if the issuer fails to consummate such an IPO or sale within twelve months of a demand, then the dividend rate
will increase by 1.0 percentage point per annum, subject to the Maximum Rate); (f) certain consent rights of the
holders of the preferred shares over, among other things, the incurrence of indebtedness, the making of restricted
payments and transactions with affiliates; and (g) the right of the Vista Stockholders to designate one non-voting
observer to the issuer’s board of directors so long as they own at least 30% of the preferred shares outstanding at
such time.
On March 7, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting. Members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Kirkland also attended portions of the meeting, and representatives of Goodwin attended the
meeting. Representatives of Goodwin noted that, prior to this meeting, Goodwin received confirmations from both of
the members of the Special Committee that neither had any disabling conflicts of interest with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with Vista or Blackstone or any of their respective affiliates (including their
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
respective portfolio companies). Representatives of Kirkland then summarized the material aspects of the Preferred
Term Sheet in connection with the Vista Preferred Financing, noting that the parties largely modelled the economic
and covenant terms of the Vista Preferred Financing from prevailing market terms for third-party debt financing in a
leveraged buyout. Representatives of Goodwin then discussed the Special Committee’s fiduciary duties under
Delaware law in connection with the review of the potential transaction involving Blackstone and involving the Vista
Preferred Financing. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland then discussed Blackstone’s request to initiate
discussions regarding potential rollovers and other post-closing arrangements with certain members of the
Company’s management. Following such discussion, and in light of the key terms of the potential transaction,
including the maximum price that Blackstone would be willing to pay, having been finalized, the members of the
Special Committee authorized high-level, non-binding discussions to occur, with more detailed discussions, including
as to negotiation of binding rollover agreements, to be deferred until the Special Committee provided further
approvals at a later time. In executive session, with representatives of Kirkland having left the meeting and
representatives of Goodwin still in attendance, the Special Committee also discussed the potential engagement of J.P.
Morgan to advise the Special Committee with respect to a potential transaction. The Special Committee noted J.P.
Morgan’s extensive expertise, qualifications, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates, and
experience representing special committees. Following such discussion, the Special Committee authorized Goodwin
to negotiate terms of an engagement letter with representatives of J.P. Morgan and procure J.P. Morgan’s
relationships disclosure with respect to the potential transaction. Representatives of Goodwin then provided a
summary of the current legal terms of the Vista Preferred Financing and also noted that they expected Blackstone to
further negotiate the terms contained in Vista’s initial draft Preferred Term Sheet in favor of Blackstone.
Also on March 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher a revised draft of
the Merger Agreement and ancillary transaction documents. Between March 7, 2023 and March 14, 2023,
representatives of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of the Company and Blackstone, respectively, exchanged
drafts of the Merger Agreement and ancillary transaction documents, and conducted a number of conference calls
regarding the draft Merger Agreement and ancillary transaction documents. Among other items in the draft Merger
Agreement, the parties negotiated the termination fees to be payable by the Company and Blackstone, regulatory
efforts, the treatment of equity awards, the inclusion of a go-shop covenant, the terms of the no-shop covenant, caps
on the parties’ liability, closing timing and the conditions to the Merger. Representatives of Kirkland delivered such
drafts of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents to representatives of Goodwin for its review and
comment, which, in turn shared such documents with the Special Committee promptly as received.
On March 8, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland also
attended portions of the meeting and representatives of Goodwin attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners reviewed with the Special Committee the outreach process undertaken by the Company to date and the
status of discussions with the parties that had indicated an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company,
including (x) the discussions with Blackstone and the terms of the Vista Preferred Financing and (y) that (1) Party A
stated that it would be unable to improve the purchase price set forth in the Revised Party A Proposal, (2) Party A
stated that it required partnership with other equity financing sources, and (3) Party A had not engaged in other
steps necessary to consummate a transaction, including, among other things, requesting access to begin
confirmatory diligence and providing any comments to the draft Merger Agreement. By comparison, Blackstone had
completed confirmatory diligence and substantially completed the negotiation of the draft Merger Agreement. The
Special Committee discussed the terms of the Vista Preferred Financing. The Special Committee also discussed the
outreach process undertaken by the Company to date and whether based on such process and in light of the Vista
Preferred Financing, any further outreach to additional potential bidders or to prior bidders, including to offer
financing terms similar to the Vista Preferred Financing, would present a reasonable likelihood of producing a
proposal that is superior to the March 4 Proposal. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined that it
would further assess such matters, including the Vista Preferred Financing, before deciding on any further outreach.
On March 9, 2023, Qatalyst Partners delivered an updated relationship disclosure letter to the Board.
Also on March 9, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor
(which we refer to herein as “Party L”) concerning its potential interest in an acquisition of the Company and relayed
this inquiry to the Board.
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on March 9, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also attended portions
of the meeting and representatives of Goodwin attended the meeting. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed its
preliminary analysis of the Vista Preferred Financing terms and hypothetical third party financings in the current
market.
Also on March 9, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. Members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners updated the Board with respect to the revised terms proposed by Blackstone and the negotiations
that had occurred over the past week. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed its financial analyses of the
March 4 Proposal based on the February Projections (as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Merger - Certain Financial Projections”). The Board also considered the inbound inquiry from Party L
and given the amount of time that had elapsed following the WSJ Article and the presence of a fully negotiated and
diligenced proposal from Blackstone that was not subject to the completion of additional confirmatory diligence, the
Board chose not to respond to such inbound inquiry. Representatives of Kirkland discussed with the Board its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the potential transaction, as well as approaches for mitigating
or neutralizing any conflicts of interest, including the formation of the Special Committee. Representatives of Kirkland
summarized the terms of the draft Merger Agreement, as well as the terms of the Preferred Term Sheet, including with
respect to redemption rights, transferability of equity, consent rights, registration rights and indemnification
obligations, and other transaction documents, but the Board did not assess whether the Vista Preferred Financing
was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Vista Stockholders. The Board discussed the price and other
terms of the Merger Agreement and indicated its support for a transaction on those terms, subject to the prior
favorable recommendation of the Special Committee. The Board also reviewed Qatalyst Partners’ updated relationship
disclosure letter and determined that based on the letter it continued to believe that Qatalyst Partners did not have
any conflicts that would affect the ability of Qatalyst Partners to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to the
Board.
Also on March 9, 2023, J.P. Morgan provided the Special Committee with customary relationship disclosures
regarding J.P. Morgan’s relationships with Blackstone and Vista.
Also on March 9, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher revised drafts of
the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee. Between March 9, 2023 and March 14, 2023, representatives
of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of the Company and Blackstone, respectively, exchanged drafts of the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the
drafts of such agreements. Representatives of Kirkland delivered such drafts to representatives of Goodwin for its
review and comment.
Later on March 9, 2023, the Special Committee held another meeting with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin
present. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed the February Projections and the December Projections. Following
discussion, the Special Committee approved the February Projections and directed J.P. Morgan to use them for
purposes of its financial analysis of the proposed transaction.
On March 10, 2023, the Company (on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Special Committee) and J.P. Morgan
executed an engagement letter.
Also on March 10, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin in
attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed its preliminary analysis of the Vista Preferred Financing terms
and hypothetical third party financing terms in the current market. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also reviewed its
preliminary financial analysis of the proposed Merger Consideration, and the Special Committee discussed this
preliminary analysis. The Special Committee then discussed the likelihood that other bidders in the Company’s sale
process would have materially altered the terms of a potential transaction with the Company if such other bidders
were able to obtain financing on similar terms to the Vista Preferred Financing. After the Special Committee’s
discussion, the Special Committee determined that the March 4 Proposal was the best price reasonably available and
that contacting the prior bidders or additional potential bidders would be unlikely to result in a proposal that is
superior to the current Blackstone proposal.
Also on March 10, 2023, representatives of Kirkland delivered to representatives of Simpson Thacher drafts of the
Preferred Commitment Letter and the Voting Agreements for certain management members. Between March 10, 2023
and March 14, 2023, representatives of Kirkland and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of the Company and
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Blackstone, respectively, exchanged drafts of the Preferred Commitment Letter and the Voting Agreements for certain
management members, and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the drafts of such agreements.
Representatives of Kirkland delivered such drafts to representatives of Goodwin for its review and comment.
Also on March 10, 2023, representatives of Blackstone met telephonically with Mr. Aggarwal, with representatives of
Simpson Thacher and Kirkland in attendance, to discuss members of senior management’s receptiveness to a rollover
of their investment in the Company as part of a potential transaction. Mr. Aggarwal confirmed that, subject to the
negotiation of definitive terms at a later date (if and as approved by the Special Committee), members of senior
management would be receptive to rolling over a material portion of their investment in the Company but no specific
terms or amounts were discussed or agreed regarding such potential rollover.
On March 13, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting, with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin present.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goodwin discussed the Vista Preferred Financing terms and hypothetical third
party financings in the current market. Following discussion and consideration of the transaction documents,
including the Preferred Commitment Letter, the Special Committee, having considered the course of dealing among
the Company, Vista and Blackstone with respect to the Vista Preferred Financing, determined that the economic and
legal terms of the Vista Preferred Financing were not more favorable in the aggregate to Vista than as could be
achieved in arm’s-length similar transactions in the prevailing market. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed
its financial analysis of the proposed Merger Consideration and then formally delivered J.P. Morgan’s oral opinion to
the Special Committee, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14,
2023, that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its
opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Cvent common stock (other than (i) the holders of
Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) the holders of Dissenting Company Shares (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), and (iii) the Vista Stockholders) in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Merger - Opinion of J.P. Morgan.” The Special Committee then adopted resolutions favorably
recommending the potential transaction with Blackstone and the Vista Preferred Financing to the Company Board
after consideration of the factors described in the section titled “The Merger - Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Cvent Board.”
On the evening of March 13, 2023, following the Special Committee meeting, the Board held a meeting with members
of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives
of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board its financial analyses of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of
Company common stock in cash, without interest. At the conclusion of its presentation, Qatalyst Partners delivered
to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of March 13, 2023, and based
upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters considered in the
preparation thereof as set forth therein, the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of Company common stock in
cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is more fully described in the section of this
proxy statement titled “The Merger - Opinion of Qatalyst Partners.” Representatives of Kirkland summarized the
terms of the draft Merger Agreement and the Preferred Term Sheet. Following discussion and consideration of the
Merger, the draft Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the
other transaction documents (including the factors described in the section titled “The Merger - Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Cvent Board”), the members of the Board, by
unanimous resolution, and acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee: (a) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement
providing for the Merger, in accordance with DGCL, and the other Transaction Documents, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein; (b) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other
obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein; (c) resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL; and (d) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the
Company’s stockholders at a meeting thereof. Further, the members of the Board reviewed and approved the Voting
Agreements, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Company disclosure letter and other
transaction documents, as well as the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Commitment Letter.

The Special Committee, comprised solely of disinterested and independent members of the Company Board,
unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, and the other
Transaction Documents, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (b) approved the execution
and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein; and (c) resolved to recommend that the Company Board approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The Company Board, acting on the
recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger, in
accordance with the DGCL, and the other Transaction Documents, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder,
and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (iii) resolved to
recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (iv)
directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Company’s stockholders
at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting.
In reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Cvent stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement, the Special Committee and the Cvent Board considered the following positive reasons to support
the Merger and recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement:
The Special Committee
The Special Committee, in reviewing and evaluating the Merger, including the Vista Preferred Financing, consulted
with the Special Committee’s independent legal and financial advisors. In the course of reaching its determination and
making its recommendations, the Special Committee considered the following list of material factors, which are not
presented in any relative order of importance and each of which the Special Committee viewed as being generally
supportive of its determination and recommendations to the Board:
•
the fact that the price per share of $8.50 in cash provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to the
Company’s stockholders other than the Vista Stockholders;
•
the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Company common
stock, including the fact that $8.50 per share to be received by Cvent stockholders in the Merger represents
a premium of approximately (a) 52% to the volume weighted average share price over the 90 days prior to
January 30, 2023, the day before media reports of a potential transaction were published and (b) 15% to the
closing share price on March 13, 2023, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger;
•
the belief that the per share price of $8.50 in cash is more favorable to Company stockholders on a risk-
adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the
Company, based upon the Special Committee members’ extensive knowledge of the Company’s business,
assets, financial condition and results of operations, the execution challenges that the Company potentially
faces, the Company’s historical and projected financial performance, and market dynamics;
•
the sale process conducted by the Company, with the assistance of Qatalyst Partners and Kirkland, to
review other potential strategic alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with a range of
counterparties (including Parent) regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company;
49TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the belief that, after multiple rounds of negotiations with Parent, $8.50 per share is the highest price that
Parent is willing to pay and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to the
Company, in the aggregate, to which Parent is willing to agree and that further soliciting other potential
buyers would not yield proposals of greater value;
•
the determination that the terms of the preferred equity (which is the security being offered to the Vista
Stockholders in return for Vista’s reinvestment of its cash proceeds from the transaction into the post-
closing Company) are not more favorable in the aggregate to the Vista Stockholders than as could be
achieved in arm’s-length similar transactions in the prevailing market;
•
the Special Committee’s view on the potential effect of the Vista Preferred Financing if similar financings
were offered to other bidders in the sale process;
•
the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of March 14, 2023, as to the fairness, from
a financial point of view as of the date of such opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of Cvent Common Stock (other than shares of Cvent common stock held by the Company as
treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), in each case, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their
statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in the
proposed Merger, which opinion was based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in
its opinion (see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Opinion of J.P. Morgan”);
•
the high degree of confidence that the Merger would close in a timely manner in light of the conditions and
other terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, which terms include the limited and qualified
representations and warranties given by the Company and customary closing conditions;
•
the terms of the Merger Agreement, including:
•
the ability of the Company to entertain an unsolicited proposal that would reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, and to terminate the Merger Agreement with Parent to exercise its
“fiduciary out” to enter into such a Superior Proposal (subject to the payment by the Company of a
termination fee) (see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Termination
Fees and Expenses”); and
•
the requirement that, in certain events of a failure of the Merger to be consummated relating to
Parent’s refusal to close or material breach arising in the failure of a closing condition, Parent will pay
the Company a “reverse” termination fee in the amount of $277,216,878, which is guaranteed by funds
affiliated with Parent and ADIA (see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement
- Termination Fees and Expenses”); and
•
the likelihood of completing the Merger, based on, among other matters:
•
the agreement by the parties to the Voting Agreements to vote their securities of the Company in favor
of, and take certain other actions in furtherance of, the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger (see the section of this proxy statement titled “Voting Agreements”);
and
•
the experience, reputation and financial capabilities of Blackstone and its equity financing sources,
including Blackstone's proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions.
The Special Committee also considered a number of factors discussed below relating to the procedural safeguards
that it believes were and are present to ensure the fairness of the Merger and to permit the Special Committee to
effectively represent the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Special Committee believes these
factors support its determinations and recommendations and provide assurance of the procedural fairness of the
Merger to the Company stockholders:
•
that the Special Committee consists solely of independent, for purposes of serving on the Special
Committee, and disinterested directors without any member of the Special Committee (a) being an employee
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) being affiliated with Parent or the Vista Stockholders or their
affiliates, or (c) having any financial interest in the Merger that is different from that of the unaffiliated
stockholders, other than as discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of
the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the authority granted to the Special Committee by the Board to review and evaluate the Merger, including
the Vista Preferred Financing, to determine not to pursue any agreement with Parent, and to analyze,
investigate, pursue and negotiate any alternative transaction to the Merger;
•
the fact that prior to receiving the approval of the stockholders with respect to the Merger and the Merger
Agreement, the Board, upon recommendation of the Special Committee and subject to compliance with
certain procedural requirements, may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal;
•
that the Special Committee retained and received the advice of its own independent legal and financial
advisors;
•
the various terms of the Merger Agreement, including that the Merger Agreement contains the ability of
the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances to accept a Superior
Proposal, that are intended to help ensure that the Company’s stockholders receive the highest price per
share reasonably available;
•
that the Special Committee made its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger based upon the
factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of the Vista
Stockholders in the Merger; and
•
the recognition by the Special Committee that it had no obligation to recommend to the Board the approval
of the Merger or any other transaction.
In the course of reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the Special Committee also considered
a variety of uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors, which are not presented in any relative order of
importance, including:
•
that, following the completion of the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public
company and that the consummation of the Merger and receipt of the Merger Consideration, while
providing relative certainty of value, will not allow the Company stockholders to participate in potential
further growth in the Company’s assets, future earnings growth, future appreciation in value of the
Company’s common stock or benefit from any synergies that may result from the combination of the
Company and Parent and its portfolio companies;
•
the risk that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may not be
consummated in a timely manner or at all, and the consequences thereof, including (a) the potential loss of
value to the Company’s stockholders, (b) the potential negative impact on the business, operations,
financial results, stock price and prospects of the Company, and (c) the market’s perception of the
Company’s prospects could be adversely affected if such transactions were delayed or were not
consummated;
•
the possible negative effects of the public announcement of the Merger on the Company’s sales, operating
results and stock price, its ability to retain key management, sales, engineering and other personnel and its
relationships with customers and partners;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating a Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger (including certain costs and expenses if the Merger is not consummated), the substantial
management time and effort required to effectuate the Merger and the related disruption to the Company’s
day-to-day operations during the pendency of the Merger;
•
the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the Company’s solicitation of acquisition proposals
from third parties and that potential bidders may perceive Parent’s right under the Merger Agreement to
negotiate with the Company to match the terms of any Superior Proposal prior to the Company being able
to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal to be a deterrent to making alternative
proposals;
•
the possibility that the Company may be obligated to pay Parent a $138,608,439 termination fee upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;
•
that the terms of the Merger Agreement place restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior
to completion of the Merger, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business
opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger, and the resultant risk if the Merger is not
consummated;
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of willful and material breach, or and is unable to complete
the Merger due to the unavailability of its debt financing and therefore the Company is unable to
specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to complete the Merger, then the Company would need to sue for
monetary damages which are capped at $277,216,878 (plus certain reimbursement and enforcement
expenses), or, only if payable, elect to receive a termination fee equal to $277,216,878 (plus certain
reimbursement and enforcement expenses), each of which may be inadequate to compensate the Company
for the damage caused, and if available, such rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce,
and the success of any such action may be uncertain;
•
the fact that completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents;
•
the possible effects of the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the potential for suits, actions or proceedings in respect of the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that the consideration consists of cash and will therefore be taxable to Company stockholders who
are subject to taxation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
•
the risk that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no guarantee that all conditions to
the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the
Merger may not be completed even if approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting.
This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee includes the material positive
and negative factors considered by the Special Committee, but it is not intended to be exhaustive and may not
include all the factors considered by the Special Committee. The Special Committee did not quantify or assign any
specific weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Rather, the Special Committee viewed its position and
recommendation as being based on the totality of the information presented to, and factors considered by, it. In
addition, individual members of the Special Committee may have given differing weights to different factors.
The explanation of the reasoning of the Special Committee and certain information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement
titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The Board
The Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with Cvent’s senior management
and legal and financial advisors and, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board
unanimously: (a) determined that it was in the best interests of Cvent and its stockholders, and declared it advisable,
to enter into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, and the other
Transaction Documents; (b) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents by Cvent, the performance by Cvent of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (c) recommended that
the stockholders of Cvent adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (d) directed that the
adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Cvent at a meeting thereof.
Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Cvent stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement, the Board considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger and recommend
adoption of the Merger Agreement:
•
the fact that the price per share of $8.50 in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate value
and liquidity to Cvent stockholders;
•
the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Cvent common
stock, including the fact that the $8.50 per share to be received by Cvent stockholders in the Merger
represents a premium of approximately (a) 52% over the volume weighted average price per share for the 90
days ending January 30, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the publishing of media reports of a potential
transaction involving Cvent and (b) 15% to the closing share price on March 13, 2023, the last trading day
prior to the announcement of the Merger;
•
the limited liquidity of the shares of Cvent common stock due to Cvent’s high concentration of ownership;
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the current and prospective business environment in which Cvent operates;
•
the belief that the per share price of $8.50 in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Cvent
stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives
reasonably available to Cvent, based upon the Board’s extensive knowledge of Cvent’s business, assets,
financial condition and results of operations, the current macro-economic environment, Cvent’s historical
and projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an
attractive and comparatively certain value for Cvent stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects for
Cvent as a standalone public company;
•
the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Cvent’s stockholders associated with possible
strategic alternatives to the Merger (including possible alternative business combinations and scenarios
involving the possibility of remaining a standalone public company), and the timing, risks and likelihood of
accomplishing such alternatives, taking into account the Board’s belief that there were likely no other
potential strategic or financial purchasers or other parties that would be reasonably likely to engage in a
transaction in the near term at a price greater than the price being offered by Blackstone;
•
the process conducted by Cvent, with the assistance of its advisors, to review other potential strategic
alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with numerous counterparties regarding their
interest in a potential acquisition of Cvent;
•
the fact that (a) following outreach from Blackstone, Qatalyst contacted 11 other prospective buyers
(including seven financial sponsors and four strategic sponsors) to gauge their interest in a potential
acquisition of Cvent, and received inbound indications of interest from six other prospective buyers, (b)
over the course of several months, four prospective buyers (including Blackstone) entered into
confidentiality agreements with Cvent, to explore a potential transaction and (c) Blackstone was the only
remaining viable acquiror of Cvent in the sale process;
•
the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Blackstone that was fully negotiated and not
subject to the completion of additional confirmatory diligence in the event that, after running a fulsome
process, Cvent sought to pursue or continue discussions with other third parties who may be interested in
pursuing a strategic transaction with Cvent prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential
negative effect that such a process might have on Cvent’s business;
•
the business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of Blackstone, and its strong track record of
investing in the events, hospitality and real estate sectors, and Blackstone’s commitment to investing in
Cvent’s mission of delivering innovative and comprehensive solutions to power the entire meetings and
events ecosystem;
•
the Board’s belief that, after the Board and its representatives negotiated with Blackstone and its
representatives (as described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger -
Background of the Merger”), the per share price of $8.50 was the highest price that Blackstone was willing
to offer and pay (taking into account the terms of the Vista Preferred Financing) as of the date of execution
of the Merger Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to
Cvent, in the aggregate, to which Blackstone would be willing to agree;
•
the fact that no potential acquirors submitted a competitive acquisition proposal or indication of interest
following the publication of the WSJ Article on January 31, 2023 indicating that Cvent was exploring a
potential sale, despite public awareness of a proposal from Blackstone;
•
the fact that the Vista Stockholders were requested to, and agreed to, provide seller financing in the form of
the Vista Preferred Financing, in order to obtain the per share price of $8.50 to be paid by Blackstone, and
other stockholders were not asked or required to provide seller financing;
•
the belief that, if Cvent did not enter into the Merger Agreement with Blackstone, there could be a
considerable period of time, if ever, before the unaffected trading price per share of Cvent’s common stock
would reach and sustain the per share price of $8.50, as adjusted for present value (even assuming full
realization of the management projections);
•
the fact that Qatalyst Partners delivered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to
the effect that, as of March 13, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various qualifications,

assumptions, limitations and other matters considered in the preparation thereof as set forth therein, the
merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to
be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders, as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger - Opinion of Qatalyst Partners,” which full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its
entirety;

the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan to the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of March 14, 2023, that as of the date of such opinion,
and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of Cvent Common Stock (other than shares of Cvent common stock held by the
Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), in each
case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised
their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in
the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described under
the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Opinion of J.P. Morgan,” which full text of the
written opinion of J.P. Morgan is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
•
the fact that Cvent has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course prior to
the consummation of the Merger;
•
the high likelihood that the Merger would close in a timely manner in light of the conditions and other terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement, and the requirement that the parties use their respective reasonable best
efforts to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including to obtain all
necessary governmental approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable;
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and scope, and
which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Cvent’s representations and warranties, is
generally subject to a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Merger Agreement - Representations and Warranties”) qualification;
•
the fact that the definition of “Company Material Adverse Effect” has a number of customary exceptions
and is generally a very high standard applied by courts;
•
the ability of the Board to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in certain
circumstances, and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal upon payment of a
termination fee of $138,608,439 (which the Board believed was reasonable under the circumstances) (as
described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement -
Termination Fees and Expenses”);
•
the possibility that Parent may be obligated to pay Cvent a termination fee of $277,216,878 under certain
circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement (as described in more detail under the section of this
proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees and Expenses”);
•
the end date of December 14, 2023 (subject to extension until March 14, 2024 under certain circumstances),
which is expected to allow for sufficient time to complete the Merger;
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to Cvent stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement was approved by the Board at the recommendation of the Special
Committee, which received advice from outside financial and legal advisors in evaluating, negotiating and
recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement;

arm’s-length negotiations;

Cvent’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment
Letters, to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter, if the debt financing is
available;
•
Blackstone’s and ADIA’s guarantee with respect to the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses incurred by Cvent in connection with any litigation contemplated by (and solely to the extent
reimbursable under) the Merger Agreement, subject to a cap of $198,588,802.73 and $83,628,075.27,

the fact that the Vista Stockholders, Rajeev K. Aggarwal, Charles V. Ghoorah and David C. Quattrone
(collectively, holders of approximately 87.5% of the Company’s shares of common stock, as of the date of
entry into such Voting Agreements), each agreed to enter into a Voting Agreement to vote their or his
shares in favor of the Merger;

Consideration and other amounts required to consummate the Merger;
•
Cvent’s rights to specific performance under the terms of the Merger Agreement; and
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, in light of the experience, reputation and financial
capabilities of Blackstone and the equity financing source.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered, among other things, the following negative factors:
•
the fact that Cvent stockholders (other than the Vista Stockholders) will not participate in any future
growth potential or benefit from any future increase in the value of Cvent as a private company following
completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
•
the possibility that all conditions to the Merger will not be timely satisfied or waived and that the Merger
will not be consummated, and the potential negative effects on Cvent’s business, operations, financial
results and stock price;
•
the potential negative effects of the public announcement of the Merger on Cvent’s sales, operating results
and stock price, its ability to retain key management, sales, engineering and other personnel, and its
relationships with customers, suppliers and business partners;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Cvent’s business prior to the completion of the Merger, requiring Cvent
to conduct its business in the ordinary course and preventing Cvent from taking certain specified actions,
subject to specific limitations, all of which may delay or prevent Cvent from undertaking certain business
opportunities pending completion of the Merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time
and effort of Cvent’s management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business
operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
•
the conditions to the obligations of Parent to complete the Merger and the right of Parent to terminate the
Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement precludes Cvent from actively soliciting alternative acquisition
proposals, and the possibility that Cvent may be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee of $138,608,439
in the event that Cvent terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;
•
the fact that each of Parent’s and Cvent’s liabilities for expenses to enforce the terms of the Merger
Agreement are limited to $5,000,000;

applicable antitrust laws and certain foreign investment laws;

the fact that the consideration consists of cash and will therefore be taxable to Cvent stockholders who are
subject to taxation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
•
the interests that certain Cvent directors and executive officers may have with respect to the Merger, in
addition to their interests as Cvent stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger - Interests of Cvent’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not, and is not intended to be,
exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the
complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to rank
or assign relative weights to the various factors considered in reaching their respective determinations. In
considering the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of the Board may have viewed
factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration to different factors. In addition, the Board did not
undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular
factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board, but rather the Board conducted an
overall review of the factors described above, including discussions with the Company’s management and legal and
financial advisors. Further, the Board did not assess whether the Vista Preferred Financing was advisable, fair to and
in the best interests of the Vista Stockholders.
The foregoing discussion of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-
looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section of this
proxy statement titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Opinion of Qatalyst Partners,"Opinion of Qatalyst Partners
The Company retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Cvent Board in connection with a potential
transaction such as the Merger and to evaluate whether the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company
common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of
Parent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the
Company’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of the
Company’s business and the industry in which the Company operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written
consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Cvent Board on March 13,
2023, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Cvent Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of March 13, 2023 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and
other matters set forth therein, the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash,
without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by
the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. Following the meeting, Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated
March 13, 2023, to the Cvent Board.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated as of March 13, 2023, is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things,
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review
undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Cvent Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common
stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to
such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any
Company stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner
address the price at which the shares of the Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
For purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March 13, 2023 (the
“Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other
business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the February Projections,
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
which are described more fully in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Certain Financial
Projections.” Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and
the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the
historical market prices and trading activity for the Company common stock and compared the financial performance
of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company common stock with that of certain other selected
publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the
extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such
other information and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or
discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to the February Projections, Qatalyst Partners was
advised by the Company’s management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with the management
and the Cvent Board, that the February Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance
of the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that terms of the Draft Merger
Agreement would not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver
or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of
the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse
effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Qatalyst
Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition,
Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company
as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology
and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners’ opinion committee in accordance
with its customary practice. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with
respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of the
Company common stock will trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion
may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion did not address the underlying
business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash,
without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by
the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst
Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of (a) the compensation to any of
the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to
such consideration or (b) any consideration to be received by the Vista Stockholders or any of their affiliates other
than the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to
be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion
dated March 13, 2023. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any
portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners
utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts’ projections of the future financial performance of the
Company as of March 13, 2023 (the “Analyst Projections”) and the February Projections. Some of the summaries of
the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and
in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together
with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of
potential per-share present values for the Company common stock as of December 31, 2022 (which is the end of the
Company’s most recent completed fiscal year and most recent balance sheet date) by:
•
adding:
(a)
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of the Company, based
on the February Projections, for calendar year 2023 through calendar year 2027 (which implied present
value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 12.0% to 15.0%, based on an estimated
weighted average cost of capital for the Company calculated using the capital asset pricing model and
inputs based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment);
(b)
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by
multiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow of the Company in calendar year 2028 of
approximately $476 million based on the February Projections, by a range of multiples of fully diluted
enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 16.0x to 24.0x (which was
chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment), and discounted to present value using
the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above; and
(c)
the Company’s cash and cash equivalents of approximately $140 million as of December 31, 2022, as
provided by the Company’s management; and
•
subtracting:
(a)
the principal amount of the Company’s outstanding senior secured revolving credit facility of
approximately $208 million as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the Company’s management; and
(b)
fees payable to customers of approximately $38 million, as provided by the Company’s management;
and
•
dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares of the Company common stock
(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as of March 10, 2023, which takes into account the Options
and RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts were provided by the Company’s management,
with each of the above-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having
also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective
applicable period (approximately 4% annually through calendar year 2027) due to the estimated net effects
of equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future
dilution provided by the Company’s management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common
stock of approximately $7.09 to $11.25.
Selected Companies Analysis
Qatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company
with publicly available information and public market multiples for selected companies, which were selected by
Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in
similar lines of business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have
other relevant or similar characteristics.
Based upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the selected companies as of March 13, 2023, and
using the closing trading prices as of March 13, 2023 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners
calculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus
revenue for calendar year 2023 (the “CY2023E Revenue Multiples”) for each of the selected companies.

Based upon the Analyst Projections and the January 30 Price, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue
Multiple for the Company of 4.8x.
Based on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for the selected companies and the application of its
professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 4.0x to 6.5x and applied this
range to the Company’s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue based on each of the February Projections and the
Analyst Projections. Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding sentence and the number of fully-diluted
shares of the Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as of March 10, 2023, which
takes into account the Options and RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts were provided by the
Company’s management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common stock of
approximately $5.44 to $8.76 based on the February Projections and approximately $5.53 to $8.90 based on the
Analyst Projections.
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected
companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control
of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the Company’s business and the industry in general, industry
growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and prospects or the
industry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the
arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners reviewed and compared 55 selected public all-cash software transactions announced since 2011
that had an announced deal value of greater than $1 billion.
For each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the fully
diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of the actual revenue from the last completed twelve-
months of the target company (“LTM Revenue Multiple”), and (b) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the analysis of the LTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners selected
a representative multiple range of 6.3x to 9.9x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment)
and applied that range to the Company’s revenue for the twelve-month period ended on September 30, 2022, of $604
million, as provided in the Company’s public filings. Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding sentence
and the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as
of March 10, 2023, which takes into account the Options and RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts
were provided by the Company’s management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company
common stock of approximately $7.03 to $11.04.
Based on the analysis of the NTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners selected
a representative multiple range of 5.3x to 8.4x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners' professional judgment)
and applied that range to the Company’s projected revenue for the twelve-month period ending on September 30,
2023 of $706 million, based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding
sentence and the same fully-diluted share count calculation as used for the analysis utilizing LTM Revenue Multiples
above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common stock of approximately $6.95 to
$10.97.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the Merger. In
evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general
business, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, such
as the impact of competition on the Company’s business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence
of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial
markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the
transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining
the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautions
against placing undue reliance on this information.
Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Cvent Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,
Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to
any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its
analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less
weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not
be taken to be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst
Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Any estimates contained in
Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without
interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the
holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. This
analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which the Company common stock might
actually trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Cvent Board was one of many factors considered by the Cvent
Board in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Cvent Board with respect to the merger consideration of $8.50 per share
of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with,
the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any
affiliate of Parent), or of whether the Cvent Board would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The
merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, payable in
the Merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was
unanimously approved by the Special Committee and the Cvent Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to the
61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to
the Company or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between
Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC
(“Vista Equity Partners Management”), Parent or Blackstone, an affiliate of Parent, on the other hand, pursuant to
which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except for a fee of approximately $62 million
received by Qatalyst Partners in connection with acting as a financial advisor to Datto Holding Corp., a portfolio
company of Vista Equity Partners Management, in connection with its announced transaction involving Kaseya
Holdings Inc. and Kaseya Inc. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may have provided, and may in the future
provide, investment banking and other financial services to the Company, Vista Equity Partners Management, Parent
or Blackstone, or their respective affiliates, in each case, for which Qatalyst Partners may have received, or would
expect to receive, compensation. The information disclosed in this paragraph regarding relationships of Qatalyst
Partners and fees recognized by it is based upon information provided to the Company by Qatalyst Partners.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided the Company with financial advisory services
in connection with the proposed Merger for which it will be paid approximately $50 million, $5 million of which was
payable upon the delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining
portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to
reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company has also agreed to
indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and
employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’

The Special Committee retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to
deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Special
Committee, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14, 2023, that as of
the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Cvent Common Stock (other than shares of Cvent common stock
held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), in each
case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their
statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in the proposed
Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated March 14, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this Proxy
Statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this Proxy
Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s stockholders are
urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Special Committee (in its
capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed
only to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock (other than shares of
Cvent common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in
the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness
of any consideration paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company, as to the Preferred Equity Financing or the Preferred Commitment Letter, or as
to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any
other matter.
62TABLE OF CONTENTS
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated March 13, 2023 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of the Company common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other
companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company
relating to its business, as approved for J.P. Morgan’s use by the Special Committee; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with the Special Committee and certain members of the management of the
Company with respect to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the
Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P.
Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for
J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for
independently verifying) any such information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct nor was
it provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of
the Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying
on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they
were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by
management of the Company and the Special Committee as to the expected future results of operations and financial
condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger
Agreement, and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof
provided to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company
and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects
material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by
advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without
any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock (other than shares of Cvent
common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub), in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in
the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the
holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, as to the Preferred Equity
Financing or the Preferred Commitment Letter, or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to
any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to
the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock in the proposed Merger or with
respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
J.P. Morgan was not authorized by the Special Committee or otherwise to and did not solicit any expressions of
interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of the Company or any other alternative
transaction.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm’s length
negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that
of the Special Committee and the Cvent Board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the
many factors considered by the Special Committee in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be
viewed as determinative of the views of the Special Committee, the Cvent Board or the Company’s management with
respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14, 2023, and in the financial analyses presented to the
Special Committee on March 13, 2023 in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary
of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion to the Special
Committee and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some
of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not
intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables
must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data
for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the
Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were:
•
DocuSign, Inc.
•
New Relic, Inc.
•
Five9, Inc.
•
Paycor HCM, Inc.
•
Freshworks Inc.
•
Vertex, Inc.
•
Zeta Global Holdings Corp.
•
Sprinklr, Inc.
These companies were selected because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, were considered similar to the Company. However, certain of these companies
may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the
companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect the
Company.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the multiple of the firm value
(the “FV”) (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable, net debt or net cash) to the analyst consensus
estimates of calendar year 2023 and 2024 revenues for the applicable company (the “FV/2023E Revenue Multiple” and
“FV/2024E Revenue Multiple”).

Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2023E Revenue Multiple reference range for the
Company of 3.3x to 5.8x and a FV/2024E Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 2.9x to 4.9x. J.P.
Morgan then applied such reference ranges to the Company’s projected revenue for calendar years 2023 and 2024,
respectively, as set forth in the February Projections. These analyses indicated a range of firm values, which was then
adjusted to take into account the Company’s net debt of $106 million obtained from the Company’s management,
calculated as of December 31, 2022 to derive ranges of implied per share equity value for the Company common stock
(rounded to the nearest $0.10) of approximately $4.50 to $7.90 and $4.80 to $8.10 for 2023 and 2024, respectively. J.P.
Morgan compared this to the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock.
Selected Transaction Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses which J.P.
Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company’s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan’s
experience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target
company's FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company's estimated revenue for the twelve months
immediately following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the “FV/NTM Revenue Multiple”).
The following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger and
the FV/NTM Revenue Multiple for each such transaction are as indicated in the following table:

None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected transactions
were chosen by J.P. Morgan because J.P. Morgan judged certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P.
Morgan’s analysis, to be similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations
and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and
other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.
Based on the results of this analysis and J.P. Morgan’s professional judgment and experience, J.P. Morgan selected a
FV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 4.0x to 8.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied such
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for calendar year 2023 as set forth in the February Projections.
The analysis indicated a range of firm values, which was then adjusted to take into account the Company's net debt
of $106 million obtained from the Company’s management, calculated as of December 31, 2022, which further
indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the Company common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of
approximately $5.50 to $11.40, which J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the
Company common stock.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis, using the unlevered free cash flows (less stock-based
compensation) that the Company was forecasted to generate from December 31, 2022 through fiscal year 2028, as set
forth in the February Projections, for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for the
Company common stock. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of the 6-
year period ending in 2028 by applying terminal growth rates ranging from 4.5% to 5.5%, which were determined
based on J.P. Morgan's professional judgment and experience, to estimates of terminal revenue for the Company at
the terminal year, based on the February Projections. J.P. Morgan then discounted such unlevered free cash flow
estimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging
from 11.0% to 12.0%, which range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost
of capital of the Company. The present values of such unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal
values were then adjusted for the Company’s estimated net debt of $106 million obtained from the Company
management, calculated as of December 31, 2022 to derive implied equity values per share of the Company common
stock on a fully diluted basis. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the Company
common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of $6.30 to $8.60, which J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger
Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock.
Other Information
J.P. Morgan observed certain additional information for reference purposes only and not as a component of its
fairness analysis:
•
52-Week Historical Trading Range. J.P. Morgan reviewed the 52-week trading range of the Company
common stock for the period ending January 30, 2023, representing the last unaffected trading day prior to
news that the Company was exploring a sale, which was $4.09 to $8.91 per share of the Company common
stock. J.P. Morgan compared that range to (a) the closing share price of the Company common stock of
$4.09 on June 10, 2022, (b) the closing share price of the Company common stock of $8.91 on March 10,
2022 and (c) the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan noted
that historical trading range analyses were presented merely for reference purposes only and not as a
component of its fairness analysis.
•
Analyst Price Targets. J.P. Morgan reviewed the price targets of five publicly available equity research
analysts for the Company common stock available as of March 13, 2023, which provided a reference range
of $6.00 to $11.00 per share of the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan compared the analyst price targets
analysis to (a) the closing share price of the Company Common Stock of $6.57 on January 30, 2023, the last
unaffected trading day prior to news that the Company was exploring a sale, and (b) the Merger
Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan noted that the analyst price
target analyses were presented merely for reference purposes only and not as a component of its fairness
analysis.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary
and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these
analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes
and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the Company, the order of
analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In
arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in
isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and
analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected
transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be
considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their
participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger.
The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to
the Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Special Committee and deliver an
opinion to the Special Committee with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience
and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the
industries in which it operates.
J.P. Morgan received a fee from the Company of $4,000,000 for the rendering of its opinion to the Special Committee.
In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its
services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities
arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had
commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have
received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as co-placement agent on
an offering of equity securities of the Company’s predecessor in December 2021. During the two years preceding the
date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have also had commercial or investment banking
relationships with the Company’s approximately 81% stockholder, Vista Equity Partners (“Vista”), for which J.P.
Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included
providing debt syndication services, equity underwriting, and financial advisory services to Vista portfolio
companies. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates
have also had commercial or investment banking relationships with Parent’s parent entity, Blackstone, for which J.P.
Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included
acting as joint lead arranger on a syndicated credit facility for a Blackstone affiliate in February 2021, joint lead
bookrunner on an offering of debt securities of a Blackstone affiliate in September 2021, joint lead bookrunner on an
offering of equity securities of a Blackstone affiliate in September 2021 and financial advisor to a Blackstone affiliate
on its acquisition of an ownership stake in Elba Liquefaction Company in May 2022. During the two years preceding
the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have also had commercial or investment
banking relationships with Blackstone portfolio companies, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included providing debt syndication, equity
underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Blackstone portfolio companies. In addition, J.P.
Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Vista and its
portfolio companies and Blackstone and its portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or
other financial benefits. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its written opinion ending on March 14,
2023, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from the Company were approximately $37 million, from Vista were
approximately $30.4 million, and from Blackstone were approximately $239.6 million, as provided by J.P. Morgan. In
addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of
each of the Company and Blackstone. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan
67

and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank
loans or other obligations) of the Company or Blackstone for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.",71,77

The Company does not, in the ordinary course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the
public, given, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and
the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized or may change. In connection with
the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, senior management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial
information for the Company. Financial projections for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through
2025 were prepared by senior management and were reviewed and approved for use by the Board on December 6,
2022 (the “December Projections”). The December Projections were (a) shared on December 8, 2022 with Blackstone
and (b) uploaded on December 9, 2022 to the virtual data room set up for the transaction, where other potential
bidders that were admitted to the virtual data room were provided with access to the December Projections. At the
request of Blackstone, the Company’s management also prepared free cash flow projections for each quarter of fiscal
year 2023 (the “Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections”), which were calculated based on the Adjusted EBITDA
for fiscal year 2023 on a quarterly basis and were approved by the Board on January 6, 2023, and provided to
Blackstone on January 8, 2023. At the direction of the Board, the Company’s management also prepared free cash
flow projections for fiscal years 2024 through 2028 and extrapolated the December Projections to include projections
for fiscal years 2026 through 2028 (the “January Projections”), which were approved by the Board on January 6, 2023.
In February, the Company’s management updated each of the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections (as updated,
the “Updated Free Cash Flow Projections”) and the January Projections (as updated, the “February Projections”) to
reflect refined assumptions with respect to projected cash taxes for fiscal year 2023 and the impact of such refined
assumptions on the Company and its free cash flow. The Updated Free Cash Flow Projections were calculated based
on the Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2023 on a quarterly basis, were approved by the Board on February 12, 2023
and were provided to Blackstone on February 13, 2023, and the February Projections were approved by the Board on
February 12, 2023 for use and reliance by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its financial analyses and in
connection with its opinion to the Board as described above under the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger - Opinion of Qatalyst Partners.” The February Projections were also approved by the Special Committee on
March 9, 2023 for use and reliance by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses and in connection with its
opinion to the Special Committee described above under the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger -
Opinion of J.P. Morgan.” The February Projections, the January Projections, the December Projections, the Updated
Free Cash Flow Projections and the Supplemental Free Cash Flow Projections are collectively referred to herein as the
“Projections.”
The Projections were prepared by senior management at the direction of the Board. The Projections were not
prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines
of the SEC or established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation
of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Projections have
been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not
audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying
projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement relates to the Company’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Projections and
should not be read to do so.
The tables below present summaries of the Projections, as prepared by senior management and provided by senior
management to the Board and the Special Committee. The Projections summarized below are included solely to
provide the Company’s stockholders access to financial projections that were made available to the Board, the
Special Committee, Qatalyst Partners, J.P. Morgan and/or Blackstone in connection with the proposed Merger, and
are not included in this proxy statement to influence a Company’s stockholder’s decision whether to vote to adopt
the Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.
The Projections summarized below, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and
assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive,
regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are
beyond the Company’s control. The Projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change, including, but
not limited to, assumptions regarding: demand for events and meetings, the return to in-person events,
68TABLE OF CONTENTS
demand for advertising and software solutions, and demand for an integrated platform; growth rates; market share;
market size and conditions; products and product mix; contract duration expansion; renewal rates; operating
expenses; margins; ability to maintain and expand relationships with hotels and venues; and net working capital. The
Projections cover multiple years, and thus, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each
successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Projections include, but
are not limited to: general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit or securities
markets; industry and market dynamics; competition; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; changes in applicable
laws; and those risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022. See also the section of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements.”
In addition, the Projections reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple
interpretations based on actual results, revised prospects for the Company’s business, changes in general business
or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not
anticipated when the Projections were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from
those contained in the Projections. The Projections assume organic company growth without business expansions
from mergers and acquisitions or alternative business or licensing models. In addition, the Projections do not take
into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the Projections were
prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses incurred after the date on which they were made,
including as a result of the Merger or any effects of the Merger. The Company does not intend to update or
otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections were
prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions
are shown to be in error. There can be no assurance that the financial results in the Projections will be realized, or that
future actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the Projections.
Certain of the measures included in the Projections, including adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow, are
financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not
be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures
used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures, because they
exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, non-GAAP
financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC’s rules
concerning non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-
GAAP financial measures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is
included in a document such as this proxy statement, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP
financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared
or relied upon by the Board or the Special Committee in connection with their consideration of the Merger Agreement
or by either Qatalyst Partners of J.P. Morgan for purposes of its financial analyses. Accordingly, the Company has
not provided a reconciliation of any financial measures included in the Projections.

The inclusion of selected elements of the Projections in the tables and accompanying narrative above should not be
regarded as an indication that the Company and/or any of our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives consider the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information
should not be relied upon as such. The Projections were based upon certain financial, operating and commercial
assumptions developed solely using the information available to the Company’s senior management at the time the
Projections were created. None of the Company and/or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives gives any Company’s stockholder or any other person any assurance that actual results will not
differ materially from the Projections and, except as otherwise required by law, the Company and/or its affiliates,
officers, directors, advisors or other representatives undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or
reconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections were prepared or to
reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying
the Projections are shown to be in error. The Company has made no representation to Parent or Merger Sub
concerning the Projections in the Merger Agreement or otherwise.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, the Company’s stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on such Projections.
Certain Effects of the Merger",77,79
CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Certain Effects of the Merger,"Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Merger Proposal is approved and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cvent upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the
surviving corporation in the Merger, Cvent will continue to exist following the Merger and as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.
Following the Merger, all shares of Cvent common stock will be beneficially owned by Parent and, except as
otherwise expressly agreed to in writing, none of the Company’s current stockholders will have any direct ownership
interest in, or be a stockholder of, the Company, the surviving corporation or Parent after the consummation of the
Merger. Following the Merger, Parent will have the potential to benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and
also will bear the risk of any decrease in the Company’s value.
At the Effective Time, and without any action by any stockholder, except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing
prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a Cvent stockholder, each share of Cvent common stock that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Cvent common stock held by the
Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which
statutory rights of appraisal have been properly exercised in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be
70TABLE OF CONTENTS
automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. See the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Consideration to be Received in the Merger.”
Immediately prior to the Effective Time:
•
Cvent Stock Options. Each Option granted in 2022 (other than Options granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will
be governed by their original terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such Option that would have
otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case,
subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates. Each Vested Option with an
exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will, at the Effective Time, be automatically
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Cvent common stock
subject to such Vested Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the excess of the Merger
Consideration minus the per share exercise price of such Vested Option. Each Unvested Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share less than the
Merger Consideration will, at the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to
receive Cash Replacement Option Amounts which will, subject to the holder’s continued service through
the applicable vesting dates, generally vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Options for
which the Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms.
Each Option (whether a Vested Option or an Unvested Option) with an exercise price per share that is equal
to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no
consideration.
•
Cvent RSU Awards. Each RSU award granted in 2022 (other than RSU awards granted to Mr. Aggarwal
which will be governed by their original terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such RSU award that
would have otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025,
in each case, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates. Each Vested
RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the
Merger Consideration and (b) the total number of shares of Cvent common stock subject to such Vested
RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Unvested RSU award will automatically, at
the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into Cash Replacement RSU Amounts, which will, subject to
the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates, generally vest and be payable at the
same time as the Unvested RSU awards for which the Cash Replacement RSU Amounts were exchanged
would have vested pursuant to their terms.
Cvent common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol
“CVT.” Following the consummation of the Merger, shares of Cvent common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. In
addition, the registration of shares of Cvent common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated and the
Company will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to its common stock.
Termination of registration of Cvent common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required to be
furnished by the Company to the Company’s stockholders and the SEC, and will make provisions of the Exchange
Act, such as the requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy
statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer
applicable to the Company.",79,80

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Cvent common stock in
connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, Cvent common stock
will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, Cvent common stock will continue to be registered under the
Exchange Act, the Company will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to its common
stock and the Company’s stockholders will continue to own their shares of Cvent common stock and will continue to
be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of Cvent
common stock.
71TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of your shares of Cvent common stock, including the risk that the market price of Cvent common stock may
decline to the extent that the current market price of Cvent common stock reflects a market assumption that the
Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance that any other transaction acceptable
to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of the
Company will not be adversely affected. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, the
Company is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction and may be
obligated to pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. Further, under certain circumstances, Parent may be
obligated to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee. See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - Termination.”",80,81
CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $4,589,000,000, which will be funded via the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing and the Preferred
Equity Financing described below. Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Cvent in the Merger Agreement that,
assuming the consummation of the Preferred Equity Financing, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing are
sufficient to pay a portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration and related fees and expenses of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub (including in connection with the Merger and the Financing).
Parent has obtained a commitment from the Guarantors to provide equity financing pursuant to the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letters. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
delivered to Cvent copies of the Equity Commitment Letters. Other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
proceeds of the Equity Financing. In no event will the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the
financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other
financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Debt Commitment Letter
Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, each of MSSF, UBS and Citizens has committed to fund certain senior
secured revolving and term loan facilities at the closing of the Merger for the purpose of, among other things,
allowing Parent and/or Merger Sub to fund (a) a portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable by Parent
and/or Merger Sub, (b) the repayment in full of all outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s credit agreement
and (c) related fees and expenses of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (including in connection with the
Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing).
The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. The
obligations of the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to a
number of conditions, including, but not limited to: (a) the substantially simultaneous contribution of certain
specified equity amounts, (b) the simultaneous, or substantially simultaneous consummation of the Merger and (c)
the repayment in full of all outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s credits agreement.
The obligation of the Financing Sources to fund the debt commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter will
automatically and immediately terminate in the event that either (a) the initial borrowing under the term loan facility
does not occur on or before 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five business days after the
Termination Date or (b) the date on which Parent informs the Financing Sources that the Merger Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms by Parent prior to the consummation of the Merger.
Equity Commitment Letters
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters, each of the Guarantors have committed to contribute or cause to be
contributed to Parent at the closing of the Merger certain equity financing for the purpose of allowing Parent and/or
Merger Sub to fully fund (a) a portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable by Parent and/or Merger Sub,
and (b) related fees and expenses of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (including in connection with the Merger).
The obligations of the Guarantors to provide certain equity financing under the Equity Commitment Letters are
subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: (a) the satisfaction or waiver by Parent of all of the
conditions to Parent’s obligation to effect the closing set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the Merger Agreement
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
of such conditions), (b) the substantially simultaneous funding of (i) the Debt Financing and (ii) the equity
commitments pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters of each of the other Guarantors and (c) the substantially
simultaneous consummation of the closing. Such funding will occur substantially simultaneously with the issuance
of the securities to each of the Guarantors.
The obligation of each Guarantor to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon
the earliest to occur of: (a) the consummation of the closing (but only if such obligation shall have been discharged
in connection therewith), (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (c) the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding which terminates the Guarantors’ obligations or liabilities under the
Limited Guarantees in accordance with their terms, (d) the termination of any of the other Equity Commitment Letters
of each of the other Guarantors and (e) the payment of any amounts due pursuant to the Limited Guarantees.
Cvent is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s
right to cause the commitment under the Equity Commitment Letters to be funded by the Guarantors to Parent in
accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against the Guarantors to
perform their funding obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters, in each case, subject to (a) the limitations
and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters and (b) the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement.
Limited Guarantees
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantors have executed and delivered limited
guarantees in favor of Cvent. Pursuant to the Limited Guarantees, the Guarantors have agreed to guarantee the due
and punctual performance and payment of: (a) Parent’s reimbursement and indemnification obligations set forth in the
Merger Agreement and (b) the Parent Termination Fee when and only if such amounts become payable pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limitations. The obligations of the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantees
are subject to an aggregate cap equal to $282,216,878.
The Limited Guarantees will terminate and be of no further force and effect, and the Guarantors will have no further
obligation or liability under the Limited Guarantees, upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the consummation of the closing
of the Merger, (b) subject to the cap, receipt in full in cash by the Company or its affiliates of the obligations under
the Limited Guarantees, (c) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, other than (i)
by the Company if Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its respective representations,
warranties covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement or if Parent fails to consummate the
Merger following the satisfaction by the Company of the closing conditions or (ii) by the Company or Parent if the
closing does not occur by the Termination Date at a time when the Company had the right to terminate the Merger
Agreement pursuant provisions described in clause (c)(i) and (d) 120 days following the termination of the Merger
Agreement (i) by the Company pursuant to the provisions described in clause (c)(i) or (ii) by the Company or Parent
pursuant to the provision described in clause (c)(ii) (or, if the Company has made a claim under the Limited
Guarantees prior to such date, the date that such claim is finally satisfied or otherwise finally resolved).
Preferred Commitment Letter
Pursuant to the Preferred Commitment Letter, the Vista Stockholders have committed to invest a portion of their
proceeds from the merger consideration to acquire non-convertible preferred shares of Capstone TopCo, Inc., the
indirect parent company of Parent. Such preferred shares of Capstone TopCo, Inc. shall be issued to the Vista
Stockholders at the closing of the Merger in exchange for $1,250,000,000 (the “Preferred Purchase Price”) in cash,
and, solely for administrative convenience, the payment of the Preferred Purchase Price for the preferred shares shall
be satisfied in full from the merger consideration that the Vista Stockholders would otherwise receive in the Merger
with respect to the number of shares of Cvent common stock equal to the Preferred Purchase Price divided by the per
share price of the Merger Consideration. The preferred shares will be issued pursuant to certain preferred equity
documentation expected to be entered into at the closing of the Merger, the terms of which shall be negotiated in
accordance with the Preferred Commitment Letter. The closing of the Preferred Equity Financing is expected to occur
substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Preferred Commitment Letter.

In considering the recommendations of the Cvent Board with respect to the Merger, Cvent stockholders should be
aware that the directors and executive officers of Cvent have certain interests, including financial interests, in the
Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Cvent stockholders generally. The Special
73TABLE OF CONTENTS
Committee and the Cvent Board were aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving the Merger Agreement, and in making its recommendation that Cvent stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement. See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Background of the Merger” and the section
of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and
the Cvent Board.” These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the
narrative and the tables below.
Treatment of Cvent Equity Awards
Cvent Stock Options. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of
any Option, at the Effective Time, each Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an
exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will automatically, be treated as follows:
•
2022 Options. Each Option granted in 2022 (other than Options granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will be
governed by their original terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such Option that would have
otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case,
subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates.
•
Vested Options. Each Vested Option will, at the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes)
equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Cvent common stock subject to such Vested Option as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
per share exercise price of such Vested Option.
•
Unvested Options. Each Unvested Option will, at the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Cash Replacement Option Amounts, i.e., an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of
Cvent common stock subject to such Unvested Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Unvested Option.
The Cash Replacement Option Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service through the
applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Options for which the Cash
Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms, including with
respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting.
Each Option (whether a Vested Option or an Unvested Option) with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no consideration.
Cvent RSU Awards. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of any
RSU award, at the Effective Time, each RSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be treated as follows: 
•
2022 RSU Awards. Each RSU award granted in 2022 (other than RSU awards granted to Mr. Aggarwal
which will be governed by their original terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such RSU award that
would have otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025,
in each case, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates.
•
Vested RSUs. Each Vested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes)
equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration and (b) the total number of shares of Cvent common
stock subject to such Vested RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
•
Unvested RSUs. Each Unvested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Cash Replacement RSU Amounts, i.e., an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration
and (b) the total number of shares of Cvent common stock subject to such Unvested RSU award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Cash Replacement RSU Amounts will, subject to the holder’s
continued service through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the
Unvested RSU awards for which the Cash Replacement RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested
pursuant to their terms, including with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting.
74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Quantification of Payments. All Unvested RSU awards held by our non-employee directors will fully vest at the
Effective Time, subject to the non-employee director’s continued service through the Effective Time. The estimated
aggregate amount that would be payable to Cvent’s seven non-employee directors for their Unvested RSU awards if
the Effective Time occurred on May 1, 2023 is $567,290. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our named
executive officers are expected to receive any accelerated vesting or payment in respect of their Options or RSU
awards as a result of the consummation of the Merger or in connection with any termination of employment following
the consummation of the Merger. 
Employment Agreements with Executive Officers
Each of Rajeev K. Aggarwal, Cvent’s Chief Executive Officer, Charles V. Ghoorah, Cvent’s President of Worldwide
Sales, David C. Quattrone, Cvent’s Chief Technology Officer, William J. Newman, III, Cvent’s Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer and Jeannette Koonce, Cvent’s General Counsel and Corporate Secretary is party to an
employment agreement with Cvent (the “Employment Agreements”). Under the Employment Agreements, each
executive officer is eligible for certain severance payments and benefits if he or she incurs a termination of
employment by Cvent without cause or resigns for good reason (each, a “qualifying termination”).
The Employment Agreements provide that, upon a qualifying termination, Messrs. Aggarwal, Ghoorah, and
Quattrone would be entitled to:
•
12 months of base salary continuation;
•
to the extent approved by the Cvent Board and Cvent’s Chief Executive Officer, a prorated bonus based on
actual performance for the year in which such termination occurs; and
•
reimbursements of any health coverage premiums paid under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”) for a period of up to 12 months.
The Employment Agreements provide that, upon a qualifying termination, Mr. Newman and Ms. Koonce would be
entitled to:
•
12 months of base salary continuation, provided that any remuneration received between the date that is 6
months following termination and the date that is 12 months following termination will be offset against any
base salary continuation on a dollar-for-dollar basis;
•
to the extent approved by the Cvent Board and Cvent’s Chief Executive Officer, a prorated bonus based on
actual performance for the year in which such termination occurs; and
•
reimbursement of any health coverage premiums paid under COBRA for a period of up to 6 months.
Payments and benefits under each of the Employment Agreements are subject to the applicable executive officer’s
execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of Cvent and continued compliance with the
Company’s Confidentiality, Invention Assignment, Non-Solicit, Non-Compete, and Arbitration Agreement.
Arrangements with Parent
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has had any discussions or negotiations, or
entered into any agreement, with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding the potential terms of their individual
employment arrangements or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates
following the consummation of the Merger. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, certain executive
officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent, Cvent, or their respective affiliates
regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its
affiliates.
280G Mitigation Actions
Under the Merger Agreement, Cvent may take certain actions before the Effective Time to mitigate the amount of
potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals” (each as defined in Section 280G of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), including the executive officers. As of the date of this
proxy statement, Cvent has not approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of Section 280G of the Code on
Cvent or any disqualified individuals.
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Special Committee Fees
In connection with their service as members of the Special Committee, members of the Special Committee are eligible
to receive an additional cash fee in the amount of $1,500 for each meeting of the Special Committee (none of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or the Special Committee’s or the Cvent Board’s recommendation
of the Merger).
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cvent’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain
ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. See the section of
this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification of Directors and Officers and Insurance.”
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that may be paid or become payable to each of our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this
compensation.
The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for
purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on May 1, 2023, that the named executive officer’s
employment is terminated by Cvent without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, and, in each
case, on that date, the named executive officers’ salary and target bonus amounts are those in effect as of the date of
this proxy statement.
In addition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment,
these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table

The cash amounts reflected in this column represent potential severance payments to each named executive officer pursuant to
each named executive officer’s Employment Agreement if the named executive officer incurs a qualifying termination of
employment. Specifically, the cash amounts consist of (i) a severance payment in an amount equal to 12 months of base salary,
and (ii) to the extent approved by the Cvent Board and Cvent’s Chief Executive Officer, a prorated bonus based on actual
performance for the year in which such termination occurs. For purposes of this disclosure, the amount of each named executive
officer’s bonus at target performance levels assuming a termination date of May 1, 2023 has been included. The severance
amounts are “double trigger” payments and would be payable upon a named executive officer’s qualifying termination of
employment without regard to whether the Merger occurs. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement titled

The following discussion summarizes certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of
Cvent common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Cvent common stock pursuant to the Merger. This
discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the U.S. Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of
this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements set forth herein. The U.S.
federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to
seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (referred to herein as the “IRS”) regarding any of the tax issues
discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences of
the Merger described in this proxy statement.
This discussion assumes that holders of Cvent common stock hold their shares as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of Cvent common stock in light of
such holder’s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local, non-U.S., or estate or gift taxes, the
alternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the
Code, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any other aspect of any U.S. federal tax other than the income
tax. This discussion also does not address tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of Cvent common stock
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions, brokers
or dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds, partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, S
corporations, tax-exempt organizations, governmental organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts,
insurance companies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign
corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their
Cvent common stock through the exercise of Company stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who
hold their Cvent common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, U.S. holders
(as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real estate investment trusts, regulated
investment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Cvent common stock under the constructive sale
provisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) an equity interest in Parent or the
surviving corporation and holders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Cvent common stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of
the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership holding Cvent common stock or a partner of a partnership
holding Cvent common stock, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger relevant to you.
This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of Cvent common stock are urged
to consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in light
of their particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the Merger arising under the U.S. federal tax
laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, “golden parachute” rules, or under
any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Cvent common stock that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a trust if (a) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more U.S. persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (b) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of the Code); and
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Cvent common stock that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate that is not a U.S. holder.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Cvent common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger
(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share of Cvent common
stock will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. Such gain or loss generally will be
capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares
exceeds one year as of the date of the closing. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders,
including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of federal income taxation. Short-term capital gains are
taxed at ordinary income rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss must be
calculated separately for each block of Cvent common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and at the
same price in a single transaction). U.S. holders who own separate blocks of Cvent common stock should consult
their own tax advisors with respect to these rules.
A U.S. holder may, unless an exception applies, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding
(currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the Merger, unless such U.S. holder
provides its correct taxpayer identification number (referred to as the “TIN”) on IRS Form W-9 (or if appropriate, a
substitute or successor form) and certifies under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such U.S.
holder is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner and
other requirements are satisfied.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and,
if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the
case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case
the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder and, if
the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the
rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on earnings and
profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
business, subject to certain adjustments;
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S.
holder generally will be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at such lower rate as may be specified under an
applicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder’s net gain realized in the Merger, which may be offset
by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any (even though the individual is not
considered a resident of the United States), provided that such non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal
income tax returns with respect to such losses; or
•
the Company is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time during the shorter of (a) the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger and (b)
the non-U.S. holder’s holding period in Cvent common stock, and, at any time during such period, the non-
U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the outstanding Cvent common
stock. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its
U.S. real
78
TABLE OF CONTENTS
property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property
interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. The Company does not believe
that it was and does not expect that it will be a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding
(currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received by such non-U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger, unless
such non-U.S. holder provides the Payment Agent with an applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8 certifying
under penalties of perjury the holder’s non-U.S. status (and the payor or applicable withholding agent does not have
actual knowledge or reason to know that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person as defined under the Code) or
otherwise establishes an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available
under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the taxing authorities of the country in which the
non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, provided that the non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner and
other applicable requirements are satisfied. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.
IN ADDITION, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH,
OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, A HOLDER’S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH HOLDER
IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER TO SUCH HOLDER IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER’S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY STATE,
LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

U.S. Antitrust
The obligations of Parent and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the waiting period applicable to
the Merger under the HSR Act. Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
Merger may not be completed until notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the
FTC and the DOJ and the specified waiting period has expired or has been terminated. The Company and Parent each
filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on March 28,
2023. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 PM EDT on April 27, 2023. Both before and after the
expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on
antitrust grounds.
In addition, the Merger may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which Parent and the
Company operate. These authorities may claim that there is authority, under the applicable state and federal antitrust
laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to prohibit the Merger under the circumstances and based on the
standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that one or more state
attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the Merger. As of the date of this proxy
statement, neither Parent nor the Company has been notified by any state attorney general indicating any plan to
review the Merger.
Other Regulatory Notifications
The consummation of the Merger is also conditioned upon the clearance or approval by the antitrust authorities in
certain other jurisdictions and other relevant governmental authorities under foreign investment laws. The Merger
cannot be completed until Cvent and Parent obtain clearance to consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting
periods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions.
There can be no assurances that all of the required regulatory approvals will be obtained and, if obtained, there can
be no assurances as to the timing of any approvals.
The Merger Agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties, with respect to filings under the HSR Act
and foreign regulatory laws, to supply (or cause to be supplied) information that may be required to make such filings
or any
79TABLE OF CONTENTS
additional information that may be requested by the FTC, DOJ, or other governmental authorities in which such a
filing is made, to cooperate and coordinate (and to cause their respective affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with
the other to make such filings, and to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their
respective affiliates), all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to (a) cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and obtain any foreign regulatory consents applicable to
the Merger as promptly as practicable and (b) obtain all clearances, consents, approvals, waivers, actions, non-
actions, or other authorizations pursuant to the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust laws and foreign investment laws
applicable to the Merger as promptly as practicable. For more information regarding these covenants, see the section
of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Filings.”",88,89
CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger,"Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger
In connection with the Merger Agreement, one complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and is captioned O'Dell v. Cvent Holding Corp. et al., Case No. 23-cv-03688 (filed May
2, 2023). The foregoing complaint is referred to as the “Merger Action.” The Merger Action asserts violations of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Merger Action alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed by
the Company with the SEC on April 21, 2023, misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information
relating to the Company's financial projections and the analyses performed by the financial advisors to the Cvent
Board and Special Committee in connection with the Merger. The Merger Action seeks, among other things, an
injunction enjoining the stockholder vote on the Merger and the consummation of the Merger unless and until
certain additional information is disclosed to Cvent stockholders, costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys'
fees and experts' fees, and other relief the court may deem just and proper. The Company cannot predict the outcome
of the Merger Action. The Company believes that the Merger Action is without merit and Cvent and the individual
defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Merger Action and any subsequently filed similar actions. If
additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or significantly different allegations, the Company will not
necessarily disclose such additional filings.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The provisions of the
Merger Agreement are extensive and not easily summarized. We urge you to carefully read this entire proxy
statement, including the annexes and the other documents to which we have referred you. You should also review the
section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide you with information regarding its terms, and we recommend
that you read it in its entirety. The Merger Agreement is a contractual document that establishes and governs the
legal relations between the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and allocates risks between the parties, with respect to
the Merger, the other agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each
other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates specified in the Merger Agreement. The
assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract
between the respective parties and are subject to representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely
for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting
parties (including being qualified by a confidential disclosure letter made for the purposes of allocating contractual
risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts), and may be subject
to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors, security
holders, or securities laws. Investors and security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger
Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions
thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger Agreement.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date
of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public
disclosures.
The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the description of them in this proxy statement
should not be read alone but instead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the
reports, statements and filings the Company publicly files with the SEC. Such information can be found elsewhere in
this proxy statement and in the public filings the Company makes with the SEC, as described in the section of this
proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

At the Effective Time, all Cvent equity awards, including awards held by our non-employee directors and executive
officers that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will generally be subject to the following
treatment:
Cvent Stock Options
In connection with the Merger, each Option granted in 2022 (other than any Options granted to Mr. Aggarwal which
will be governed by their original terms) will be modified so that the tranche of such Option that would have
otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case, subject to
the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates.
The Merger Agreement provides that each Vested Option with an exercise price per share less than the Merger
Consideration will, at the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares
of Cvent common stock subject to such Vested Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the excess
of the Merger Consideration minus the per share exercise price of such Vested Option.
The Merger Agreement provides that each Unvested Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and has an exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration will, at the Effective Time, be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive Cash Replacement Option Amounts which will,
subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates, generally vest and be payable at the
same time as the Unvested Options for which the Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have
vested pursuant to their terms.
Each Option (whether a Vested Option or an Unvested Option) with an exercise price per share that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no consideration.
Cvent RSU Awards
In connection with the Merger, each RSU award (other than any RSU awards granted to Mr. Aggarwal which will be
governed by their original terms) granted in 2022 will be modified so that the tranche of such RSU award that would
have otherwise vested in 2026 will instead vest (a) 40% on July 1, 2024 and (b) 60% on July 1, 2025, in each case,
subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates.
The Merger Agreement provides that each Vested RSU award will automatically, at the Effective Time, be cancelled

stock subject to such Vested RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

following the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent an amount of
cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to holders of Cvent common stock (other than to holders
of shares of Cvent common stock for which statutory rights of appraisal have been properly exercised in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL). The Company will, solely at the written request and direction of Parent, deposit with
the Payment Agent at the closing such portion of such an amount of aggregate consideration from the Company’s
cash denominated in United States dollars and held in United States bank accounts as specified in such request.
Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three business days), Parent and the Company will
cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of Cvent common stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other subsidiaries, as applicable, or to holders of shares of Cvent common stock for which statutory rights of
appraisal have been properly exercised in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) of one or more certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Cvent common stock (other
than any shares of Cvent common stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other subsidiaries, as applicable) (the “Certificates”) (a) a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary
form and which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Cvent common stock
formerly represented by the Certificates. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Cvent common stock represented by such
Certificates by (ii) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered will be canceled. No record holder of
uncertificated shares of Cvent common stock (other than any shares of Cvent common stock that are held by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiaries thereof) will be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the Merger
Consideration. With respect to record holders of such uncertificated shares of Cvent common stock, upon the
Payment Agent’s receipt of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request), the holder of such uncertificated shares will be entitled to receive in exchange an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Cvent common stock represented by
such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares by (B) the Merger Consideration, and the transferred uncertificated
shares will be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or uncertificated share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and uncertificated shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof. You should not send in your Certificates until you receive a letter of transmittal with instructions
from the Payment Agent. Do not send your Certificates with your proxy card.

At or prior to the closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate vested equity award consideration owed to all holders of vested Cvent
equity awards. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than five business days after the
closing date, the holders of Vested Options and Vested RSU awards will be paid by Cvent or the surviving
corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect
of such vested equity awards that are canceled and converted into a cash payment, less any required withholding.
Each of the Company, the surviving corporation, Parent and the Payment Agent, and each of their respective
affiliates and agents, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any person pursuant to the
Merger Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld pursuant to any law with respect
to applicable taxes. Any amounts so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to any

The Company also agreed to, within two business days following the execution of the Merger Agreement, request
that all non-public information previously provided by or on behalf of Cvent or any of its subsidiaries to any person
(other than Parent, the Guarantors, the financing sources and their respective representatives and affiliates) with
whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into at any time prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with
respect to an acquisition proposal be returned or destroyed, and agreed to immediately cease and cause its
subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective representatives to, immediately cease
and terminate any discussions, communications or negotiations with any person (other than the parties to the
Merger Agreement and their respective representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal and shut off all
access granted to any such person to any electronic data room.
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company will be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate or modify, any
provision of any standstill or similar provision that prohibits a proposal being made to the Cvent Board (or any
committee thereof, including the Special Committee) unless the Cvent Board (or any committee thereof, including the
Special Committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
If, at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger
Agreement and the Company’s receipt of the Cvent stockholder approval, the Cvent Board receives an Acquisition
Proposal that the Cvent Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) (a) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and (b) that the failure to participate in
discussions with respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law, the Company is entitled to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with and furnish any
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is provided to
such person and was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) following the time it is provided to such person.
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, Cvent agreed to as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 48 hours) notify Parent of Cvent’s receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must include the identity
of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and a summary of the material terms and conditions (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the form and amount of consideration and proposed financing arrangements) of such
Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent submitted in writing, copies of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
must also keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within 48 hours), of the status and
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments, revisions or other changes thereto) and
the status of any related discussions or negotiations.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal (other than an offer
or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub) to engage in an Acquisition Transaction. Furthermore, the term “Acquisition
Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger) involving:
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of shares of more than 20% of the outstanding Cvent
common stock (or voting power of the Company), including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in a person beneficially owning more than 20% of Cvent common stock
(or voting power of the Company) outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or
exchange offer;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of more than 20% of the consolidated assets (including
equity securities of the subsidiaries of the Company), net revenue or net income of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the
Cvent Board), acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee;
•
any direct or indirect merger, consolidation, joint venture, partnership, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group would hold, directly or
indirectly, more than 20% of the equity interests or voting power of the Company or the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction; or
•
any combination of the foregoing.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
for an Acquisition Transaction on terms that the Cvent Board, acting on the recommendation of the Special
Committee, has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
would, if consummated, result in a transaction that would be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account (a) any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the Guarantees or the financing offered by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal in accordance with the
Merger Agreement and (b) the identity of the person making the proposal and other aspects of such proposal that
Cvent Board, acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee, considers in good faith to be relevant,
including with respect to legal, regulatory, financial, certainty of closing, financing matters, and the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal” in this definition, all
references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”
Cvent Board Recommendation Change
The Cvent Board may not (any of the following actions, a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, its
recommendation to Cvent stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Company Board
Recommendation”);
•
adopt, approve, recommend or endorse or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend to the Company’s stockholders an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy statement;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten business days after Parent so
requests in writing (with the Company having no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than three
separate occasions);
•
fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act,
against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D
promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten business days after the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14D-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (or if the Company
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held within ten business days from the date of such
commencement, promptly and in any event prior to the date which is one business day before the date on
which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held); or
•
resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.
In addition, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company may enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Cvent
stockholder approval, the Cvent Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) may effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to (a) a Superior Proposal, if it (acting on the recommendation
of the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (b) any
positive change, event, effect, development or circumstance that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable or the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on March 14, 2023 and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) does not relate to (A) any Acquisition Proposal or (B) the mere fact that the Company meets or exceeds any
internal or published financial projections, forecasts or estimates for any period ending on or after the date the
Merger Agreement, or changes after March 14, 2023 in the market price or trading volume of the Company common
stock (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (B) may be considered and
taken into account) (an “Intervening Event”) that occurs after March 14, 2023 (within the meaning of clause (A) of
the definition of “Company Board Recommendation Change”) if it (acting on the recommendation of the Special
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject in each case to
compliance with the procedures described below.
In the case of a Superior Proposal, no adverse recommendation change and/or termination of the Merger Agreement
may be made:
•
until after the fourth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising Parent
that the Cvent Board intends to resolve to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or
terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal and specifying the reasons, including the identity of the third party making, such
Superior Proposal, the material terms of such Superior Proposal and copies of all relevant agreements
relating to such Superior Proposal (with any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
such Superior Proposal requiring a new notice of superior proposal with a new notice period of three
business days); and
•
unless (a) during such four business day period (or three business day period following an amended
proposal), the Company agreed to negotiate with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect
a Company Board Recommendation Change or termination; and (b) at the end of such period and prior to
taking any such action, the Cvent Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to
make revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Financing Letters, and has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take such action
would continue to be inconsistent with the Cvent Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such
changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
In the case of an Intervening Event, no adverse recommendation change may be made:
•
until after the fourth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising Parent
that the Cvent Board or any committee of the Cvent Board intends to take such action and specifying the
basis for such change in the Company Board Recommendation (with any changes thereafter to the
Intervening Event in any material respect requiring a new notice of such Intervening Event with a new
notice period of three business days); and
•
unless (a) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
representatives, during such four business day period, agreed to negotiate with Parent and its
representatives in good faith to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change; and (b) at the end of such period and prior to taking any such
action, the Cvent Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to
the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Financing Letters, and has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the Cvent Board’s fiduciary duties
under applicable Law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect.

The Company has agreed to conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in a
manner to enable the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting to be set so that the Company Stockholder
Meeting can be held promptly following the effectiveness of the Proxy Statement. The Company agreed to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the proxy statement to
the Company’s stockholders (but no earlier than 20 business days following the mailing of the proxy statement to the
Company’s stockholders).
The Company may postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting:
•
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the stockholder approval;
•
for the absence of a quorum;
•
if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the stockholder meeting by applicable law or a request
from the SEC or its staff; or

Company Board (or the Special Committee) (after consultation with outside legal counsel), the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law) (provided that such
postponement or adjournment shall not occur on more than two occasions and the stockholder meeting will
not be so delayed by more than 10 business days).
The Company has agreed to ensure that the proxy statement will not, on the date it is first disseminated to
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. However, the Company assumes no
responsibility with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the proxy statement. Parent and Merger Sub agreed to ensure that such information
supplied by them for inclusion in the proxy statement will not, on the date it is first disseminated to stockholders of
the Company or at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
If at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement, any other required
Company filing or any other required Parent filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the party that
discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate party and, to the
extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company’s stockholders.
Subject to applicable law, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the proxy statement to be
disseminated to Cvent stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event more than three business
days, following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has
completed its review of, the proxy statement, which confirmation will be deemed occurred if the SEC has not
affirmatively notified the Company by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth calendar day following such filing
with the SEC that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the proxy statement.
In addition, if Cvent is required to file any document other than the proxy statement with the SEC in connection with
the Merger pursuant to applicable law, then Cvent, with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger sub as
reasonably requested by Cvent, will promptly prepare and file such filing with the SEC.

Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Cvent that:
•
Parent has delivered to Cvent a (a) true, accurate and complete copy of the duly executed Preferred
Commitment Letter pursuant to which the Vista Stockholders have agreed to provide financing to Parent (or
any direct or indirect parent company thereof) in exchange for preferred equity in Parent (or the applicable
direct or indirect parent company thereof) (the “Preferred Equity Financing”); (b) true, accurate and
complete copies of each duly executed Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, each Guarantor has committed to invest in Parent the amounts set forth
therein (the “Equity Financing”); and (c) a true, accurate and complete copy of the duly executed Debt
Commitment Letter (including all exhibits, schedules, term sheets, and annexes thereto), pursuant to which
the Financing Sources party thereto committed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein for the purposes set forth therein including the funding of the transactions
contemplated thereby and in the Merger Agreement (including the repayment in full of all outstanding
indebtedness under the Company’s credit agreement) (together with any Alternate Debt Financing, the
“Debt Financing” and, together with the Equity Financing, the “Financing”) and the related executed fee
letter (which may be redacted to omit fee amounts and economic terms).
•
The Equity Commitment Letters provide that Cvent is entitled to enforce such Equity Commitment Letters
in accordance with the terms thereof.
•
As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Financing Letters are in full force and effect and are legal,
valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the
date of the Merger Agreement, the respective commitments in the Financing Letters have not been
withdrawn, terminated, replaced or rescinded. As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Financing
Letters have not been amended or modified in any respect (other than any amendment solely executed
solely to add additional lenders, agents, arrangers, bookrunners or managers to the Debt Commitment
Letter in connection with the Financing).
•
The Financing Letters are the only agreements relating to the Financing. Other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Letters, there are no other contracts, side letters, conditions precedent or other
contingencies relating to the funding of the amount of the Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
•
As of the date of the Merger Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would (a) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, or to the knowledge of Parent, or the
other parties to the Financing Letters; (b) result in the failure of any condition to the Financing; or (c)
otherwise result in a portion of the Financing being unavailable to Parent in such an amount that would
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount required to consummate the Merger.
Assuming satisfaction of the closing conditions to the Merger, as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that the amount of the Financing required to consummate the Merger will
not be made available to Parent on the closing date As of the date of the Merger Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub have fully paid all commitment or other fees that were due and payable on or prior to the date
of the Merger Agreement.
•
Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Merger and (b) the
consummation of the Preferred Equity Financing, the aggregate proceeds of the Financing are sufficient to
(i) make all payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the aggregate Merger
Consideration); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (substantially simultaneous with the Merger) the principal of
and interest on, and all other indebtedness outstanding pursuant to certain of the Company’s indebtedness
as contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) pay all fees and expenses required to be paid at closing
by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the Financing.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors and other advisors and representatives to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things
96TABLE OF CONTENTS
necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing (or in the event any portion or all
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Alternate Debt Financing) on the terms and conditions (including, to the
extent required, the full exercise of any “market flex” provisions in the fee letter) described in the Debt Commitment
Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to:
•
maintain in in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
therein;
•
negotiate enter into, execute and deliver on the closing date of the Merger definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letter on the
terms and subject only to the conditions (including any “market flex” provisions in the fee letter) set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letter or on terms not materially less favorable from a
conditionality and enforceability (taken as a whole) perspective to Parent than the terms and conditions
related to conditionality and enforceability (taken as a whole) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including, to the extent required by the related “market flex” provisions);
•
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements related thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letters at
or prior to the time the closing is required to occur;
•
in the event that all conditions precedent contained in the Financing Letters and any related definitive
documents are satisfied, consummate the Financing at or prior to the closing; and
•
enforce their rights pursuant to the Financing Letters at or prior to the closing.
Prior to the closing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub will permit any withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the Financing Letters if such withdrawal,
rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement or modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected
to, (a) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (or the cash proceeds available therefrom) below the amount
required to consummate the Merger, (b) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the Financing or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, (c) have the effect of preventing,
materially impeding, materially delaying or otherwise materially adversely affecting the closing and the funding of the
amount of the Financing required to consummate the Merger, or (d) adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed and in reasonable detail of its reasonable best efforts to arrange
the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub will give Company prompt written notice of (along with any additional
information reasonably requested by the Company related any of the following) (a) any material breach or default,
cancellation, early termination or repudiation of the Financing Letters or any definitive agreement related to the
Financing; (b) the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any material breach, default, cancellation, early termination or repudiation by any
party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing or any provision thereof; and (c)
Parent or Merger Sub becoming aware of any fact, circumstance, event or other development that would reasonably
be expected to result in Parent not being able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing in the amount
required to consummate the Merger.
Further, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions in any fee letter) contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters and shall use the respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from the same or
alternative sources (the “Alternate Debt Financing”) in an amount sufficient, when taken with the available portion of
the Financing, to (a) consummate the Merger and (b) pay all other amounts payable by Parent in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be required to obtain
alternative financing that includes terms and conditions, taken as a whole, that are less favorable to Parent than the
terms and conditions, taken as a whole, set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, or that otherwise contain any
conditions that would reasonably be expected to make funding of such alternative debt financing less likely to occur
than pursuant to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

corporation and its subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Cvent and its subsidiaries
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a
director, officer or employee of Cvent or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (each,
together with such person’s heirs, executors and administrators, an “Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the
“Indemnified Persons”). In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving company or
any of its subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the surviving company and its subsidiaries to, cause all the
organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses provisions set forth in the organizational documents of the Company
and its subsidiaries as of March 14, 2023, which provisions will not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in
any adverse manner except as required by applicable law.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates in effect on March 14, 2023 will, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from
and against any costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any
legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, to the extent that such
legal proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to the fact that an Indemnified
Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Cvent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or taken at the request of Cvent or such subsidiary
or affiliate (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another person (including any employee benefit plan),
regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the
Effective Time); and the Merger, as well as any actions taken by Cvent, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the
Merger (including any disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries that is alleged to
have rendered the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent).
99TABLE OF CONTENTS
If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such legal proceeding, the
surviving corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by
an Indemnified Person in the defense of such legal proceeding. None of Parent, the surviving corporation nor any of
their respective affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to,
or otherwise seek the termination of, any legal proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of
all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such legal proceeding. Any determination required to be made
with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard
will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the surviving corporation (which counsel will be reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the surviving corporation.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to, maintain in effect Cvent’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of Cvent’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance; provided that in no event will the surviving corporation be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of
350% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is referred to as the
maximum annual premium. If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the maximum annual premium,
then the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the maximum annual premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Cvent’s
current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. In satisfaction of the foregoing obligations, prior to the Effective
Time Cvent may (and at Parent’s request, the Company will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the
Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does
not exceed the maximum annual premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective
Time, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in
full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations
under such “tail” policy. If the Company is unable to obtain the “tail” policy and Parent or the surviving corporation
are unable to obtain the insurance described above for an annual cost less than or equal to the maximum annual
premium, Parent will cause the surviving corporation to instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
an aggregate annual premium equal to the maximum annual premium.

CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,Employee Benefits Matters,"Employee Benefits Matters
For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent agreed to provide each employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who continues employment with Parent or any subsidiary of Parent (including the surviving corporation) immediately
following the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with (a) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target
short-term cash incentive opportunities (including bonus and commission compensation) that are, in each case, no
less than those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time; (b) severance and
termination benefits that are no less favorable than those applicable to Continuing Employees under the
arrangements set forth in the confidential disclosure letter; and (c) other benefit or compensation plans, programs,
policies, agreements or arrangements (excluding retention, change-in-control compensation, equity or equity-based
plans and arrangements and other similar long-term compensation, nonqualified deferred compensation, retiree
medical or welfare arrangements and defined benefit pension benefits) at levels that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those in effect for Continuing Employees under the Company’s employee plans as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is made available
to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each such plans, a “New Plan”), the surviving corporation
and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause to be granted
to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance entitlement or termination pay), except (a) to the extent
that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits for the same period of service or (b) for purposes of any
defined benefit pension plan or plan that provides retiree welfare benefits. In addition, Parent will cause the
100TABLE OF CONTENTS
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding employee plan (such
plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision or disability benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for the Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable, met or waived under the
comparable employee plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(iii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, any eligible expenses
incurred by the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan begins, if such
participation begins in the year in which the Effective Time occurs, to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employees and their covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iv) to credit the accounts of the Continuing Employees pursuant to any New
Plan that is a flexible spending account plan with any unused balances in the account of such Continuing Employees
under the Old Plan that is a flexible spending account plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeitures, except as required by the
terms of such vacation and/or paid time off policies as determined by Parent and its affiliates from time to time.

bound by the Voting Agreement. Any transfer or attempted transfer of any such shares in violation of this transfer
restrictions set forth in the Voting Agreements shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. Each stockholder
that is party to a Voting Agreement agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its affiliates not to, become a
member of a “group” (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any securities in the
Company for the purpose of opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with the transactions.
Each stockholder that is a party to a Voting Agreement has agreed to waive all appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. In addition, each such Stockholder has agreed not to commence or participate as a plaintiff in, any class
action or other legal action (including any related settlement), derivative or otherwise, against Parent, the Company or

of any duty of the Special Committee or the Company Board in connection with the Merger Agreement, the
applicable Voting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby or, with respect to Parent, claims
related to any such alleged breach.

Under the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your
shares of Cvent common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as
determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL described herein. These
rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders and beneficial owners electing to exercise appraisal rights must
comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the
statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.
This section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights.
The following discussion, however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the
DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is accessible at the following
publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated by
reference herein. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to “stockholder” (and all references
in this summary to “holder”) are to the record holder of the shares of Cvent common stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time as to which appraisal rights are asserted. All references within Section 262 of the DGCL and this
summary to “beneficial owner” mean the beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock held either in voting trust
or by a nominee on behalf of such person. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other
advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner should
exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders and beneficial
owners of shares of Cvent common stock who: (a) submit a proper written demand for appraisal of such shares to the
Company prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) do not vote such shares (and ensure that
such shares are not voted) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (c) continuously are the record holders
or beneficial owners, as the case may be, of such shares through the Effective Time; and (d) otherwise comply with
the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such shares (as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger Consideration. Any such Cvent
stockholder or beneficial owner awarded “fair value” for the holder’s shares by the court would receive payment of
that fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Merger Consideration. It is
possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the
same as, that which Cvent stockholders will receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting to vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days
before the Special Meeting. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly
available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost must be
included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company’s stockholders of the
availability of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of
the DGCL and a copy of the applicable statutory provisions is accessible at the following publicly available website
without subscription or cost: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.
Stockholders or beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the right to do so
should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure to comply with the
procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In
addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Company unless
certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners seeking
appraisal. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, stockholders and
beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own legal and financial
advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. A Cvent stockholder who loses his, her,
their or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.

How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights",118,119
CVENT HOLDING CORP._20230503_DEFM14A_20848314_4658730.Pdf,How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights,"How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are a Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares
of Cvent common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
•
You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement
at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any
proxy or vote abstaining from, voting against or otherwise failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not
constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must
reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder of record holding the shares for which appraisal is
demanded, the intention of the person to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares and, in case of a demand
made by a beneficial owner, must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s
beneficial ownership of the shares and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct
copy of what it purports to be and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to
receive notices given by the surviving corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on
the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. A stockholder’s and beneficial owner’s failure to
make a written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a
waiver of appraisal rights;
•
You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement with respect
to such shares. A vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, whether by proxy submitted by
mail, over the Internet or by telephone or at the Special Meeting, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal
rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal.
A proxy which does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must effectively revoke that proxy pursuant to one of the means described in this proxy
statement;
•
You must continuously hold (in the case of a stockholder demanding appraisal) or beneficially own (in the
case of a beneficial owner demanding your appraisal) your shares of Cvent common stock from the date of
making the demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you are a stockholder
of record and transfer the shares, of if you are a beneficial own and cease to beneficially own such shares,
before the Effective Time;
•
Any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL or
the Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Company is under no obligation to file any
petition and has no present intention of doing so; and
•
You must otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL.
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Cvent common stock.
In addition, because Cvent’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue to
be listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Cvent common stock, unless (a) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Cvent common stock eligible for appraisal or (b) the
value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1
million. We refer to conditions (a) and (b) as the “ownership thresholds.” At least one of the ownership thresholds
must be met in order for Company stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Cvent
common stock.
Voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote
on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section
262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote. However,
you must not vote your shares via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement in order to exercise your appraisal rights with respect to such shares.

Only a holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Cvent common stock may assert appraisal rights for the
shares of Cvent common stock registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on
behalf of the stockholder of record or beneficial owner of the shares. The demand should set forth, fully and
correctly, the name of the stockholder holding the shares in record name as it appears on the stock certificates (or in
the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the record holder of the shares
and that the stockholder or beneficial owner intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. In addition,
if a demand is made by a beneficial owner, the demand must (a) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares
for which the demand is made, (b) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership
and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (c) provide
an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and the office of
Register in Chancery and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. A holder of
record, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds shares of Cvent common stock as a nominee or
intermediary for others, may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to the shares of Cvent common
stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case,
the written demand should state the number of shares of Cvent common stock as to which appraisal is sought.
Where no number of shares of Cvent common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all
shares of Cvent common stock held in the name of the holder of record or beneficially owned by the beneficial owner.
If you own shares of Cvent common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent,
including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record;
however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the
demand, such person is acting as an agent.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand

If the Merger is consummated, the surviving corporation will give written notice of the Effective Time within ten days
after the Effective Time to Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners who did not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and who made a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and
otherwise complied with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any person
entitled to appraisal who did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party
will have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the per share price in accordance with the Merger
Agreement for his, her or its shares of Cvent common stock. In addition, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder or beneficial owner without the approval of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, which approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just
(including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made
with respect to the allocation of the expenses of the proceeding); provided, however, that this provision will not
affect the right of any Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal demand but who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s or
beneficial owner’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger
within 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either a record holder or a beneficial
owner of Cvent common stock, provided such person has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL
and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving corporation must commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a
petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Cvent
common stock held by all persons who have properly demanded appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no present intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares
appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time
periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
111TABLE OF CONTENTS
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Cvent common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Cvent has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of holders or beneficial owners holding or owning those shares (for which purpose the record holder of
shares held by a beneficial owner who has made a demand for appraisal shall not be considered a separate
stockholder holding such shares). The surviving corporation must give this statement to you within the later of (a)
ten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (b) ten days after expiration of the period
for delivery of demands for appraisal.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Cvent common stock
who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be
obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Court of Chancery
with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders and beneficial owners who have demanded
an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the
surviving corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders and beneficial
owners are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the persons demanding appraisal for their shares represented
by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any such person
who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss proceedings as to all Cvent
stockholders and beneficial owners if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met. Where
proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding
will be conducted as to the shares of Cvent common stock for which the applicable stockholders and beneficial
owners thereof are entitled to appraisal, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including
any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the
fair value of such shares of Cvent common stock at the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the
date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time
and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any point prior to the
Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each
person entitled to appraisal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, if the surviving
corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL, interest will
accrue thereafter only on the sum of (a) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation
in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and (b) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary cash payment before such payment was made, unless such
interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is made. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court
of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, less any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, with
interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same. Payment shall be so made to each such person
upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining
fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that
“[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider
market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which
were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of
the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or
112
TABLE OF CONTENTS
expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements
of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Cvent common stock as determined under Section 262 of
the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of
the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of
view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Moreover, neither Cvent nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share price to any Cvent stockholder or
beneficial owner exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section
262, the “fair value” of a share of Cvent common stock is less than the per share price. No representation is made as
to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of such shares, then all Cvent stockholders and beneficial owners will
lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the per share price described in the Merger Agreement, without
interest thereon.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs to the
parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of
any person whose name appears on the verified list filed by the surviving corporation who participated in the
proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion
of such, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged
pro rata against the value of all shares of Cvent common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section
262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the
DGCL. In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses of its
attorneys and experts.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the
Effective Time, vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions
on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Cvent common stock as of a
record date prior to the Effective Time.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw
a demand for appraisal and accept the per share price by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal
and an acceptance of the Merger to the surviving corporation within 60 days after the Effective Time. No appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder or beneficial owner without
the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just (including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware
Court of Chancery made with respect to the allocation of the expenses of the proceeding); provided, however, that
this provision will not affect the right of any Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal
demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger
Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect, successfully
withdraw your demand for appraisal, or lose the appraisal right, your shares of Cvent common stock will be converted
into the right to receive the per share price, without interest thereon.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of
your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your shares of Cvent
common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement without interest. In view of the complexity of the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Cvent stockholder or beneficial owner and are considering exercising your
appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.
The process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of Section
262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own legal and
financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there are any
inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.

In light of the pending Merger, Cvent has not scheduled a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. If the Merger is
completed, Cvent will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and will no longer have public stockholders, and
following the Effective Time, you will no longer be entitled to attend and participate in any future annual meetings of
our stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to notice of, and may
attend and participate in, our annual meetings of stockholders, provided that you own Cvent common stock as of the
close of business on the record date for such meeting. If Cvent holds a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, we will
provide notice of, or otherwise publicly disclose, the date on which the 2023 annual meeting will be held. If we have
public stockholders at the time of our 2023 annual meeting, the following deadlines will apply to the submission of
stockholder proposals, including director nominations.
Cvent stockholders who wish to submit proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion in
our proxy statement and form of proxy for an annual meeting of our stockholders are required to submit proposals in
writing to us, and the proposal must be received at our principal executive offices, 1765 Greensboro Station Place, 7th
Floor, Tysons, Virginia 22102, no later than 120 days prior to the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year’s
annual meeting of stockholders and follow the other procedures required by Rule 14a-8 and our Bylaws. However, if
the date of our annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary date of the
preceding year’s annual meeting, then the proposal must be received by Cvent a reasonable time before we begin to
print and mail our proxy materials for the annual meeting.
Cvent stockholders who wish to nominate persons for election to the Cvent Board or bring forth other business at an
annual meeting of our stockholders (other than a stockholder proposal submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement
and form of proxy pursuant to Rule 14a-8) must deliver written notice to the Corporate Secretary at our principal
executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s
annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is scheduled for more than 30 days
before, or more than 70 days following, such anniversary date, then the Corporate Secretary must receive the written
notice not later than the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual
meeting is first made by us. Any director nomination or stockholder proposal must also contain the information and
comply with the requirements set out in our Bylaws. In addition, to comply with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act
(the universal proxy rules), stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees, other than
Cvent’s nominees, must also provide written notice to the Corporate Secretary that sets forth all of the information
required by Rule 14a-19(b) and must be postmarked or transmitted electronically to Cvent at its principal executive
offices by the later of (a) the sixtieth day prior to the date of the annual meeting of stockholders, and (b) the tenth day
following the date on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by us.
A copy of the provisions in our Bylaws governing the notice and other requirements set forth above may be
requested, at no cost, by writing to our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Cvent Holding Corp., 1765
Greensboro Station Place, 7th Floor, Tysons, Virginia 22102.

Board of Directors
Cvent Holding Corp.
1765 Greensboro Station Place, 7th Floor
Tysons, VA 22101
Members of the Board:
We understand that Cvent Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Capstone Borrower, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Capstone Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the
“Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the
Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, other than (a) Owned Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement), and (b) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $8.50, without interest thereon (the “Per Share
Price”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Per Share Price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or
any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March
13, 2023 (the “Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial
statements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-
looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial
projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past
and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the
Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and
compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock
with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other
analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed
with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the
Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered
thereby. We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final
executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Draft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected
to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities

(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of
the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with
such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services a portion of which will become payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger
fee if the Merger is consummated and may receive an additional, smaller fee from the Company upon consummation
of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities
arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed
between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, Vista Equity Partners, Parent or
Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”), an affiliate of Parent, on the other hand, pursuant to which compensation was
received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except Qatalyst Partners acted as a financial advisor to Datto Holding
Corp., a portfolio company of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (“Vista Equity Partners”), in connection with
its announced transaction involving Kaseya Holdings Inc. and Kaseya Inc. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may
have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking and other financial services to the Company, Vista
Equity Partners, Parent or Blackstone, or their respective affiliates, in each case for which we may have received, or
would expect to receive, compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Vista Equity Partners, Parent, Blackstone or
certain of their respective affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This
opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose
without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with respect
to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company Common Stock
will trade at any time.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion
and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this
opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or
the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our
opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Price to be received pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to
the fairness of the amount or nature of (i) the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration or (ii) any consideration
to be received by the Specified Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any of their affiliates other than
the Per Share Price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Per Share Price to be
received by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such Holders.
Yours faithfully,

Special Committee of the Board of Directors 
Cvent Holding Corp. 
1765 Greensboro Station Place 
Tysons, VA 22102
Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than (i) the
holders of Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement (as defined below)), (ii) the holders of Dissenting
Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) and (iii) the Specified Stockholders (as defined in the Agreement)) of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Cvent Holding Corp. (the
“Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the
Company with a wholly owned subsidiary of Capstone Borrower, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Capstone Merger Sub,
Inc., the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company
Common Stock, other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares, will be converted into the right
to receive $8.50 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated March 13, 2023 of the Agreement; (ii)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in
which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial
terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business,
as approved for our use by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”); and (vi)
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed
appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with the Special Committee and certain members of the management of the
Company with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the
Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we
believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We
have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than (i) the
holders of Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement (as defined below)), (ii) the holders of Dissenting
Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) and (iii) the Specified Stockholders (as defined in the Agreement)) of

“Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the
Company with a wholly owned subsidiary of Capstone Borrower, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Capstone Merger Sub,
Inc., the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company
Common Stock, other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares, will be converted into the right
to receive $8.50 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated March 13, 2023 of the Agreement; (ii)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in
which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial
terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business,
as approved for our use by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”); and (vi)
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed
appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with the Special Committee and certain members of the management of the
Company with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the
Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we
believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We
have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management and the Special Committee as to the expected future
results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express
no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the

Shares) will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in an

bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11); and
(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock or (B)

Company Common Stock (collectively, the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7, and holders and beneficial owners of such Dissenting
Company Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder (or, to the extent
applicable, such beneficial owner) fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses their rights to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder (or, to the extent applicable, such
beneficial owner) fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights with respect to any Dissenting
Company Shares, such Dissenting Company Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted

Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Per Share Price without interest thereon for such Dissenting
Company Shares in accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder or beneficial owner of
Dissenting Company Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent (i)

written consent of the Company (with the prior written consent of the Special Committee), require the Company
to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands

subject to applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of such Vested Company
Option (the “Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts”). All Cash Replacement Company Option
Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the
same time as the Unvested Company Options for which such Cash Replacement Company Option
Amounts were exchanged would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting pursuant to any
Employee Plans as in effect on the date hereof). Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.8(a)(ii), all
Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to vesting) as applied to the Unvested Company Option for which they were
exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Transactions or for such other
administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts.
(iii) Out-of-the-Money Options. Each Company Option (whether a Vested Company Option or an
Unvested Company Option) with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Per Share Price will
be cancelled without any action on the part of the holder thereof and without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof.
(b) Company RSUs. Except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent
and a holder of Company RSUs, at the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder thereof, be treated as follows:
(i) Vested Company RSUs. Each Vested Company RSU shall be cancelled and converted into and will
become the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon and subject to applicable
withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Price and (B) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the “Vested RSU Consideration” together with the Vested Option Consideration, the “Vested Equity
Award Consideration”).
(ii) Unvested Company RSUs. Each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company RSU”) shall be cancelled and converted
into and will become the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon and subject to
applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Price and (B) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts”), which Cash Replacement Company
RSU Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be

payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSUs for which such Cash Replacement Company
RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting pursuant to any
Employee Plan as in effect on the date hereof). Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.8(b)(ii), all
Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions (including
with respect to vesting) as applied to the Unvested Company RSU for which they were exchanged, except
for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Transactions or for such other administrative or ministerial
changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the
administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts.
(c) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate Vested Equity Award Consideration
owed to all holders of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs (collectively, the “Equity Award
Holders”). As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than five Business Days, after the
Closing Date, the Equity Award Holders will be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its
payroll system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Vested Company
Options and Vested Company RSUs that are cancelled and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8, less any
required withholding pursuant to Section 2.12. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, to the extent that any Company RSU or Company Option constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, any payment made in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b) shall be paid on the applicable settlement or payment date for such Company RSU or
Company Option, as applicable, if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(d) Company Stock Plans; Company ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof with necessary authority) shall take such actions as are necessary and appropriate (including adopting
resolutions) to provide that (i) the Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP will each terminate as of the
Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), (ii) no offering period will commence pursuant
to the Company ESPP upon or after the date of this Agreement, and (iii) no new participants may begin
participation in (or increase their deductions under the Company ESPP or otherwise make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Company ESPP) the Company ESPP upon or after the date of this Agreement.
(e) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or a committee thereof with
necessary authority) shall take such actions (including adopting resolutions) as may be necessary or desirable
to approve, provide for or give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8 and to authorize and
direct the Company’s officers and employees to take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate to give
effect thereto, including seeking the consent of any other Person. Prior to any adoption of any such resolution,
the Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to review, all such resolutions.",147,148

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) select a nationally recognized bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment
Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Payment Fund. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than to holders of Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant to
Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall,
solely at the written request and direction of Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent at the Closing such
portion of such an amount of aggregate consideration from the cash denominated in United States dollars and
held in United States bank accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as specified in such request, and,
upon such deposit with the Payment Agent, Parent shall be deemed to have caused such funds to be deposited
with the Payment Agent. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
cash shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
A-21TABLE OF CONTENTS
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the “Payment Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for
the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of
the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at
all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than the payment to holders of Company Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.7.
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business
Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares,
as applicable) of one or more certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company
Shares, as applicable) (the “Certificates” (if any)) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Per Share Price payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share Price, and the Certificates so surrendered will
forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated
Shares”) will be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in
order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7 with respect to such
Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, such record holder, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request), will be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by
(2) the Per Share Price, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates and transfer of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c).
Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price without interest thereon,
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the
Payment Agent shall transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting such exchange present proper
evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
A-22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable.
(f) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(g) Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed
to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will
be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by Parent) upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have
not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of
Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall thereafter look for payment of the Per
Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section
2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares five years
after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any
such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with

(c) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:
(i) the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) may effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event that occurs after the date
hereof (within the meaning of clause (A) of the definition of “Company Board Recommendation Change”) if
the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that the Company Board shall not
effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in
advance (such notice period, including any extension thereto, in accordance with this Section 5.3(c)(i),
the “Intervening Event Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (acting on the
recommendation of the Special Committee) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change;
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters in
such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change;
provided that, in the event the Intervening Event to which this provision applies thereafter changes in
any material respect, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(c)(i) with respect to such new written notice, it being
understood that the “Intervening Event Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be
three Business Days; and
(3) at the end of the Intervening Event Notice Period and prior to taking any such action, the
Company Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the
terms of this Agreement and the Financing Letters, and has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s
fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect; or
(ii) if the Company has received an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a non-de
minimis breach of this Section 5.3 and that the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special
Committee) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) in order to concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company Board shall not take any action
described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) unless:
(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;
(2) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in
advance (such notice period, including any extension thereto in accordance with this Section 5.3(c)(i)
(2), the “Acquisition Proposal Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board intends to take
the actions described in clauses (A) or (B) of Section 5.3(c)(ii), including the identity of the Person or
Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all material relevant
agreements (including any Alternative Acquisition Agreements) relating to such Acquisition
Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the
Company and its Representatives, during the Acquisition Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to
enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement

and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination; provided that, in the event of any material modifications to
such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or other material terms of such proposal shall be
deemed a material modification), the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(c)(i)(2) with respect to such new written
notice, it being understood that the “Acquisition Proposal Notice Period” in respect of such new
written notice will be three Business Days; and
(3) at the end of the Acquisition Proposal Notice Period and prior to taking any such action, the
Company Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the
terms of this Agreement and the Financing Letters, and has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that (x) such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would continue to
be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes
proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
(d) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Except as permitted by Section 5.3(c) or Section 5.3(f), the Company Board (or a committee thereof, including the
Special Committee) shall not:
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse or otherwise
declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to the Company Stockholders an
Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (D)
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions); (E) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act, against any
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under
the Exchange Act within ten Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (or if the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled to be held within ten Business Days from the date of such commencement, promptly and in any
event prior to the date which is one Business Day before the date on which the Company Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled to be held) or (F) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any
action described in clauses (A) through (E), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the factually accurate disclosure by the Company of the receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal, (2) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof, including
the Special Committee) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (3) the delivery by
the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(c) will constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(e) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal or any offers or proposals that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company or any of its
Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition
Proposal; and (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
form and amount of consideration and proposed financing arrangements) of any such Acquisition Proposal and,
to the extent submitted in writing, copies of any such Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, the Company must keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within 48 hours), of the status and material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments, revisions or other changes thereto) and the
status of any related discussions or negotiations.

writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the

Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside counsel only” basis, and that the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall not in any event be required to share information that benefits from legal privilege with the

not to (i) acquire (by stock purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets, license or otherwise), or (ii)

declarations of any Governmental Authority or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period

event later than April 18, 2023, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as
reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as
amended or supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting; provided that
the Company shall not be in breach of this Section 6.3(a) as a result of any delay in filing the Proxy Statement
caused by Parent’s or Merger Sub’s failure to comply with their obligations pursuant to Section 6.3(c) in any
material respect. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement.

other hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any
Other Required Company Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information

Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so
that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information shall be promptly prepared
and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its
staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, shall provide the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any written communication with the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, and each Party shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or their
respective counsel.
(e) Notices. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall advise
the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of (i) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be; (ii)
any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing,
as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in

efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in no event more than three Business Days, following the filing thereof with the SEC

confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement,
which confirmation will be deemed occurred if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company by 11:59 p.m.,

reviewing the Proxy Statement.

(a) Call of Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3, following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company shall duly call and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Company
Stockholder Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company be required to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting prior to the
twentieth Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement.
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder
Meeting (i) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; (ii) if
there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by
proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; (iii) if
the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or a
request from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate
any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made
available to the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (or the Special
Committee) (after consultation with outside legal counsel), the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law); provided that in the case of the foregoing clause (iv), such
postponement or adjournment shall not (x) occur on more than two occasions and (y) be for more than ten
Business Days, in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, further, that in no event (x) shall the Company Stockholder
Meeting be postponed or adjourned beyond the date that is five Business Days prior to the Termination Date or
(y) once it is fixed by the Company Board, shall the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting change
(whether or not in connection with any such postponement or adjournment), without the prior written consent
of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company will conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in
a manner to enable the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting to be set so that the Company
Stockholder Meeting can be held promptly following the effectiveness of the Proxy Statement.

without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to, or permit any withdrawal, rescindment, amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to or
consent under, the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such withdrawal,
rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, consent or waiver would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (or the cash proceeds available therefrom)
below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) impose new or
additional conditions precedent to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the existing
conditions to the receipt of the Financing; (iii) expand, amend, or modify any other terms to the Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or materially delay the Closing and the funding of
the amount of the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv)
adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (provided
that (subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Section 6.5(a)), Parent and Merger Sub may amend
the Debt Commitment Letter to (A) add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, managers or agents that
have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement) (it being understood that the
aggregate commitments of the Financing Sources party to the Commitment Letters prior to such amendment,
modification or waiver (but not the aggregate commitments thereunder) may be reduced in the amount of such
additional party’s commitment) or (B) increase the aggregate amount of the Financing. Parent shall promptly
furnish to the Company true and complete copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement,
A-49TABLE OF CONTENTS
modification, consent or waiver relating to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements relating to the
Financing. Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with
this Section 6.5(a), references to the “Financing Letters” and “Debt Commitment Letter” shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified under this Section 6.5(a), and references to
the “Financing” and “Debt Financing” shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
as permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified under this Section 6.5(a).
(b) Taking of Necessary Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and other
advisors and representatives to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing (or, in the event any portion
or all of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Alternate Debt Financing) on a timely basis, but in any event
no later than the time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.3, on the terms and conditions
(including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any “market flex” provisions in any Fee Letter) set forth in
the Financing Letters, including, using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions therein; (ii) negotiate, enter into, execute and deliver on
the Closing Date definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and related Fee Letters on a timely basis on the terms and subject only to the conditions
(including any “market flex” provisions in the related Fee Letter) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
related Fee Letter or on other terms that are not materially less favorable from a conditionality and enforceability
perspective (taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms and conditions related to conditionality and
enforceability (taken as a whole) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, to the extent required by
the related “market flex” provisions), subject to any amendments, modifications or supplements thereto, or
replacements or waivers thereof permitted by Section 6.5(a); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of)
all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive
agreements related thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letters at or prior to the time the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to Section 2.3 to the fullest extent such conditions are within its control; (iv) in the event that all
conditions contained in the Financing Letters and any related definitive agreements have been satisfied (except
those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived, consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing; (v) comply in all material respects with its covenants or other obligations applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to the Financing Letters and the definitive documents relating to the Financing in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof at or prior to the time the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to Section 2.3; and (vi) enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters at or prior to the Closing.
(c) Information. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice in writing of (i) any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach or default), cancellation, early termination or repudiation by any party to the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing; (ii) the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of
any written notice or written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual material
breach, default, cancellation, early termination or repudiation (or written notice or written communications from
lenders or other sources of Debt Financing to Parent or Merger Sub of any such actual or threatened (in writing)
material breach, default, cancellation, early termination or repudiation received by Parent or Merger Sub) by any
party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; and (iii) Parent or Merger Sub becoming aware of any fact,
circumstance, event or other development that would reasonably be expected to result in Parent not being able
to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing in the amount required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the
previous sentence as promptly as reasonably practical after the date that the Company delivers a written request
therefor to Parent.

conditions (including any “market flex” provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Commitment

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Letter and related Fee Letters, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company in writing and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such
event (and in any event on or prior to the Closing Date), (i) arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such
portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative sources (the “Alternate Debt Financing”) in an
amount sufficient, when taken with the available portion of the Financing, to (A) consummate the Closing upon
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and (B) pay all other amounts payable by Parent in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, in no event shall Parent
be required to, and in no event shall its reasonable best efforts be deemed or construed to require it to, obtain
alternative financing that includes terms and conditions, taken as a whole, that are less favorable to Parent than
the terms and conditions, taken as a whole, set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (taking
into account any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto contained in the related Fee Letters) or would
require it to pay any fees or agree to pay any interest rate amounts or original issue discount, in either case, in
excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof (taking into account
any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto contained in the related Fee Letters) or which include any
conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that would reasonably be expected to make
the funding of such alternative debt financing less likely to occur, than the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; provided, further, that such Alternate Debt Financing shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company contain conditions to funding and conditions to Closing that
(1) are more onerous (in a manner adverse to the interests of the Company) than those conditions and terms
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee Letter or (2) would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to occur, and (ii) obtain one or more new
financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the “New Debt Commitment
Letters”), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in
part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection
therewith (which may be redacted solely with respect to fees and other customarily redacted economic
provisions (including customary “market flex” terms)) to the Company. Any reference in this Agreement to (X)
the “Financing Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letters” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith (which may be redacted solely with respect
to fees and other customarily redacted economic provisions (including customary “market flex” terms)) to the
extent then in effect, (Y) the “Financing Letters” shall refer to such documents as otherwise amended or
modified in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (Z) the “Financing” means the financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that none of the
obtaining of the Financing or any Alternate Debt Financing or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having or
maintaining any available cash balances is a condition to the Closing, subject to the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2.

(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers, or
employees (and any person who becomes a director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors
and administrators, an “Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement. During such
six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any adverse manner
except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.10(a), during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in effect on the date of
this Agreement shall, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees
and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, to the extent that such Legal
Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) the fact that an Indemnified
Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate; (ii) any
action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or
such Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person
(including any employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (iii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving
Corporation shall advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an
Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates shall settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or
complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation (which counsel will

be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O
Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with
respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 350% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 350% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance. In satisfaction of the foregoing obligations, prior to the Effective Time the Company may (and
at Parent’s request, the Company will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance so
long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company
elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect for a period of no
less than six years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If the Company is
unable to obtain the “tail” policy and Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance
described in this Section 6.10(c) for an annual cost less than or equal to the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
aggregate annual premium equal to the Maximum Annual Premium.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving
Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made to the extent such obligations are not
otherwise assumed by operation of Law so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and
representatives), the “Other Indemnified Persons”) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or Other Indemnified Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or Other Indemnified Persons
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons and Other Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and
Bylaws; (ii) the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification
agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or
in equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair
any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to
such policies or agreements.

short-term cash incentive opportunities (including bonus and commission compensation) that are, in each case,

and termination benefits that are no less favorable than those applicable to Continuing Employees under the
arrangements set forth in Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (iii) other benefit or

compensation, equity or equity-based plans and arrangements and other similar long-term compensation,
nonqualified deferred compensation, retiree medical or welfare arrangements and defined benefit pension
benefits) at levels that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for Continuing Employees
under the Employee Plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) New Plans. With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or
agreement that is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each such plans, a
“New Plan”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance entitlement or termination pay), except (A) to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage
or benefits for the same period of service or (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or plan that
provides retiree welfare benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New
Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a
corresponding Employee Plan (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing life
insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable, met or waived under the comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective time; (iii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, any eligible expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees
and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that
Continuing Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan begins, if such participation begins in the
year in which the Effective Time occurs, to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iv) to credit the accounts of the Continuing Employees pursuant to any
New Plan that is a flexible spending account plan with any unused balances in the account of such Continuing
Employees under the Old Plan that is a flexible spending account plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued
but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeitures,
except as required by the terms of such vacation or time off policies as determined by Parent and its Affiliates
from time to time.
(e) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any
Continuing Employee; (ii) amend any Employee Plan or New Plan; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights
in any Continuing Employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof).

Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any recovery or award, any monetary damages of any kind, including

avoidance of doubt, none of the Company Related Parties (other than the Company to the extent set forth
in this Agreement) will have any liability to any person, including any Parent Related Party, relating to,
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination (including in the event of Willful and
Material Breach) or in respect of any other document or theory of Law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at Law or equity
in contract, in tort or otherwise. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, while Parent may pursue a grant
of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.8 and payment of the Company Termination Fee or
monetary damages, in no event shall Parent be entitled to obtain (1) both (x) a grant of specific performance
pursuant to Section 9.8 that results in the Closing occurring, on the one hand, and (y) the payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever, and the payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 8.3(b), on the other hand or (2) both payment of any monetary damages in connection with the
termination of this Agreement, on the one hand, and payment of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 8.3(b), on the other hand. In no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
have liability for monetary damages (including monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and
damages pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 8.2(b)) in the aggregate in excess of the amount
of the Parent Termination Fee plus any Enforcement Expenses, which shall be the maximum aggregate
liability (including in the case of fraud or Willful and Material Breach) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to any and all claims under or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions.
(f) Acknowledgments. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an
integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(b), Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(c), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the recipient Party commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment
against the non-paying Party for the amount set forth in Section 8.3 or any portion thereof, the non-paying Party
shall pay to the recipient Party the recipient Party’s reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding (collectively, the “Enforcement
Expenses”), which Enforcement Expenses shall not exceed $5 million. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the
Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, do not constitute a penalty, but rather shall
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its
rights under this Agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board or the Special
Committee), except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no
amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 8.3(e), this last

pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein (including Section 8.3(d)), any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
A-67TABLE OF CONTENTS
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both (x) a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and (y) monetary
damages (including the Parent Termination Fee or any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance).
(b) Specific Performance.
(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (A)
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions; (B) the Parties will be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the Company’s right to specific
performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to comply with Section 6.5); (C) the ability of either Party to
recover damages for fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement (subject to Section 8.3(e))
is not intended to and does not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief; and (D) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
The Parties agree not to raise any objections, other than those based on the limitations of a Party’s right to
such relief under this Agreement, to (I) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company,
on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (II) the specific performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any
right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.
The Parties further agree that, unless and until any such relief is granted, (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 9.8, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 9.8
shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any proceeding
for) specific performance under this Section 9.8 prior to, or as a condition to, exercising any termination
right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination to the extent permitted hereunder),
nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.8 or anything set forth in
this Section 9.8 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.
(ii) Notwithstanding Section 9.8(b)(i), it is acknowledged and agreed that the Company will be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Closing only in the event that (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate
the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3, (C) all of the
conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing provided by the Debt Commitment Letter have been
satisfied (other than the receipt of the Equity Financing and the satisfaction of those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and
the full amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or would be expected to be funded at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter if the Equity Financing were funded at the
Closing, (D) the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Equity Financing have been consummated or
would be consummated in accordance with the terms thereof if the Closing were to occur, and (E) the
