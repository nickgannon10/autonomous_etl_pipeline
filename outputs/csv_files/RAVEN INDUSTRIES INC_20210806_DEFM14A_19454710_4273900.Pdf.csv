THE MERGER
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire Merger Agreement carefully because it
is the principal document governing the Merger. For more information on the Merger Agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement”
beginning on page 50 of this proxy statement.
Effects of the Merger (see page 26)
If the Merger is completed, then, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Raven in
accordance with the South Dakota Business Corporation Act (“South Dakota Law”). As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary
will cease, and Raven will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial.
Upon consummation of the Merger, your shares of Raven common stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration described
below. As a result, you will not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any interest in its future earnings or growth. As a
result of the Merger, Raven will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly owned by CNH Industrial. Following consummation of the Merger,
Raven’s common stock will be de-listed from the Nasdaq and Raven will no longer be subject to reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Merger Consideration (see page 51)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Raven shareholders will have the right to receive $58.00 in cash,
without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), for each share of Raven common stock that they own immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares
owned by Raven, CNH Industrial or any of their respective subsidiaries).
Treatment of Company Equity and Performance-Based Cash Awards (see page 52)
The Merger Agreement provides that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding equity awards of the Company will be treated as follows:
Each restricted stock unit entitling the holder to the delivery of Raven common stock upon satisfaction of vesting or other forfeiture conditions, whether
settled in cash or in Raven common stock (a “Raven RSU”) that is outstanding under Raven’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, Raven’s Amended and Restated
2010 Stock Incentive Plan or Raven’s Deferred Stock Compensation Plan for Directors of Raven (together, the “Raven Stock Plans”), whether vested or not
vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number
of shares of Raven common stock represented by the Raven RSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven RSU will automatically
vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of such Raven RSU. To the extent the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying a Raven RSU is
based on the satisfaction of performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (i) the target amount
under the terms of the applicable award agreement and (ii) the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award agreement based on
performance through the Effective Time, such performance to be determined by Raven’s reasonable determination of performance as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Any payment in respect of Raven RSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that are not permitted to be paid without
triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable
award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

Table of Contents
Each director deferred stock unit entitling a director to the delivery of Raven common stock upon satisfaction of vesting or other forfeiture conditions,
whether settled in cash or in Raven common stock (a “Raven DSU”), that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will
automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares
of Raven common stock represented by the Raven DSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven DSU will automatically vest and
be paid or distributed to the holder of such Raven DSU. Any payment in respect of Raven DSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven DSUs that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not
trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
Each option to acquire shares of Raven common stock (a “Raven Stock Option”) that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether or not vested or
exercisable, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Raven Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Raven common stock
underlying the Raven Stock Option. Any Raven Stock Option for which the exercise price is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be
canceled without any consideration.
Recommendation of the Raven Board of Directors (see page 35)
After careful consideration, the Board approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement can be found in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Raven’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 32 of this proxy
statement.
The Board recommends that Raven shareholders vote:
·
“FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement;
·
“FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger; and
·
“FOR” the proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement.
Opinion of Raven’s Financial Advisor (see page 35)
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated April 8, 2021, Raven retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to
deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Board on June 20, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
various factors, assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
Raven common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its June 20, 2021 oral opinion by
delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated June 20, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common
stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated June 20, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and
limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P.
Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Raven’s shareholders are urged to read the
opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its
evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger Consideration to be paid in the proposed
3
Table of Contents
Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders
of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Raven or as to the underlying decision by Raven to engage in the proposed Merger. The
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Raven as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or
any other matter.
For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Opinion of Raven’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 35 and Annex B to
this proxy statement.
Financing of the Merger (see page 48)
Completion of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. CNH Industrial has represented in the Merger Agreement that it has, or will have at the
Effective Time, sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to consummate the Merger.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 77)
The exchange of Raven common stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under
state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page
77 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in your particular
circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 48)
The completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals having been obtained and remaining in full force
and effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals that are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated), including the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of CFIUS approval.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of Raven and CNH Industrial have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any government authority or other third party all
documentation to effect all necessary filings and obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals.
The Company and CNH Industrial filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on July 12, 2021. The waiting
period under the HSR Act is expected to expire on August 11, 2021. The parties submitted to CFIUS a draft Joint Voluntary Notice on July 30, 2021. The parties
submitted to DDTC the required 60-day Pre-Notification of the Merger on July 30, 2021. In accordance with the National Industrial Security Program
Operating Manual, the parties notified DCSA of the Merger on July 8, 2021.
Under the Austrian Cartel Act, the Merger may not be completed until the expiration of a four-week waiting period following the filing of a notification with
the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (“FCA”). CNH Industrial filed such notification with the FCA in connection with the Merger formally on August
2, 2021. Unless extended or earlier terminated, the applicable waiting period will expire on August 30, 2021.
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger” beginning on page 62 of this proxy
statement for a more detailed discussion of the parties’ obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals in connection with the Merger.
Expected Timing of the Merger (see page 67)
We expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Merger is subject to various conditions, however, and it is possible that factors outside
the control of Raven or CNH Industrial could result in the Merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time
between the special meeting and the completion of the Merger. We expect to complete the Merger promptly following the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of
the Merger” beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement.
Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 67)
As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger depends on a number of
conditions being satisfied, including:
·
approval of the Merger Agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of outstanding shares of Raven common
stock at Raven’s shareholder meeting (the “Shareholder Approval”) in accordance with South Dakota Law;
4
Table of Contents
·
no order or injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States preventing the consummation of the Merger having
taken effect after the date of the Merger Agreement and still being in effect;
·
any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), relating to the
Merger having expired or been terminated;
·
CFIUS approval (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement— Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the
Merger”) having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect;
·
certain specified regulatory approvals having been obtained and, in each case, such approvals are not conditioned on CNH Industrial taking
any action that would constitute a materially burdensome regulatory condition (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger”);
·
subject to certain qualifications, the other party having performed in all material respects all of its obligations under the Merger Agreement
contemplated to be performed by it at or prior to the Effective Time; and
·
subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by the other party in the Merger Agreement (subject
generally to a material adverse effect standard, with different standards applicable to certain representations and warranties).
Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals (see page 59)
Subject to certain exceptions, Raven has agreed that from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise set forth below, Raven and its subsidiaries will not, and will cause their respective directors,
officers and employees, and instruct their investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other advisors or representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:
·
solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any “acquisition proposal” (as described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”) or offer or inquiry that would reasonably be expected
to lead to any acquisition proposal;
·
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Raven or any of its subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Raven or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way
with, or knowingly assist or participate in any effort by any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an acquisition proposal;
·
make an adverse recommendation change (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of
Acquisition Proposals”);
·
fail to enforce or grant a waiver or release under a standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of Raven or any of
its subsidiaries;
·
approve any transaction under, or any person becoming an “interested shareholder” under, the business combination provisions of South
Dakota Law (Section 47-33-17 to Section 47-33-19, inclusive);
5
Table of Contents
·
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar
instrument relating to an acquisition proposal; or
·
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.
Raven also agreed in the Merger Agreement to (and agreed to cause its subsidiaries to) cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party and its representatives with respect to any acquisition proposal and to send written notice
demanding that any such third party or its representatives in possession of non-public information in respect of Raven or its subsidiaries return or destroy all
such information, and that it would promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such persons.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, (i) Raven or any of its representatives receives a
bona fide acquisition proposal that the Board reasonably believes, after consultation with Raven’s financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a “superior proposal” (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”) and (ii) the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Raven may provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third
party. Raven must deliver prior written notice to CNH Industrial advising that it intends to provide such information or engage in such discussions or
negotiations, and Raven must keep CNH Industrial promptly informed of the status and material terms of any such discussions or negotiations with the
applicable third party with respect to any acquisition proposal.
Changes in Board Recommendation (see page 61)
At any time prior to obtaining the approval of Raven’s shareholders, the Board is permitted to make an adverse recommendation change (i) following receipt
of a superior proposal that did not result from a willful and material breach of the no-shop covenant or (ii) in response to an “intervening event” (as described
in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendation”), in each case, only if the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided that:
·
Raven promptly notifies CNH Industrial in writing at least five business days before taking such action, attaching (A) in the case of an adverse
recommendation change to be made following receipt of a superior proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under which
such superior proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third party making the superior proposal, or (B) in the case of an
adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such
adverse recommendation change;
·
Raven negotiates in good faith with CNH Industrial (if requested by CNH Industrial) for five business days following such notice regarding any
proposal by CNH Industrial to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement in response to such potential adverse recommendation change; and
·
The Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Raven’s financial advisor, that CNH Industrial has not
made, within such five business day period, an offer that (A) in the case of any adverse recommendation change to be made following receipt of
a superior proposal, is at least as favorable to Raven’s shareholders as such superior proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such superior proposal shall require a new written notification from Raven and a new
three business day period) or (B) in the case of an adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, obviates the
need for such adverse recommendation change.

Termination Fee Payable by Raven (see page 69)

Industrial terminates the Merger Agreement because of Raven’s intentional breach of the no–shop covenant, and:

at or prior to such termination, an acquisition proposal was publicly announced, which was not withdrawn (1) prior to the Raven

relating to an acquisition proposal (whether or not the same one) is entered into by Raven (provided that all references to “25% or more” in

Regulatory Termination Fee (see page 70)
CNH Industrial has agreed to pay Raven a termination fee of $200 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection
with a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Termination Fee” beginning on page 70

and the termination fee is paid in full, CNH Industrial and Merger Subsidiary will be precluded from any other remedy against Raven, at law or in equity or
otherwise, and neither CNH Industrial nor Merger Subsidiary will seek to obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect or punitive damages, against Raven or any of Raven’s subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
8

managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby.

shareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the termination fee is not payable by Raven and the regulatory termination fee is not
payable by CNH Industrial, the Merger Agreement will become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party); provided that, if such termination results from the intentional (i) failure of either party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to perform a covenant hereof, such party will be fully liable for
any and all liabilities and damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and

at the meeting. To view this list of shareholders during the meeting, you will need to enter your control number. You will also have the opportunity to submit
questions during the pre-registration process. We plan to respond to all appropriate questions during the webcast.
Entrance to the special meeting will open 15 minutes before the designated start time. We recommend that you access the meeting website prior to the
designated start time to ensure that you are logged in when the meeting begins. Technical support will be available before and during the virtual special
meeting; if you encounter any technical difficulties accessing or participating in the meeting, please call the technical support number that will be provided in
the email that will be sent approximately one hour before the meeting. The pre-registration website will also include an email address for technical support.
Please note that recording the special meeting will not be permitted.
The special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on the following:
·
A proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)” and “The Merger
Agreement,” beginning on pages 26 and 50, respectively, of this proxy statement;

Table of Contents
·
A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, discussed under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Raven
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement; and
·
A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to
approve the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement.
Only holders of record of Raven common stock at the close of business on August 4, 2021, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. At the close of business on the record date, 35,917,637 shares of Raven
common stock were issued and outstanding, approximately 2% of which were held by Raven’s directors and executive officers. We currently expect that all of
Raven’s directors and all executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the other proposals to be
considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive officer is obligated to do so.
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Raven common
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business
to be conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for
purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat may adjourn the special meeting from time to time. Failure of a quorum to be
represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Raven to additional expense.
You may cast one vote for each share of Raven common stock that you own at the close of business on the record date. Approval of the Merger Agreement
requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance
via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided that a quorum is present). The proposal to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured
by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided that a quorum
is present). The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, requires that the number of votes cast
in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).
An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special
meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Because the proposals require that the number of votes cast in favor of the
proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by
proxy at the special meeting, abstentions and a failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a
beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) are not
treated as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted
for (i) the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement; (ii) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be
paid by Raven to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger; and (iii) the proposal to approve the adjournment of the
special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger
Agreement.

Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 42)
In considering the recommendation of the Board to approve the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Raven’s directors and executive officers have
interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Raven’s shareholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and in recommending
to Raven’s shareholders that the Merger Agreement be approved. These interests are described in further detail and quantified below under “The Merger
(Proposal 1)—Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification (see page 66)
For six years after the Effective Time, CNH Industrial has agreed to, and to cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former directors and officers of Raven, exclusively in their capacity as such, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the
fullest extent provided under South Dakota Law and Raven’s articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on June 20, 2021.
Market Prices of Raven Common Stock (see page 71)
The Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 50% over Raven’s closing share price on June 18, 2021, the last trading
day prior to the announcement that Raven had entered into the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 34% to Raven’s thirty (30)-day volume-
weighted average stock price on the same date. The closing price of Raven common stock on the Nasdaq on August 5, 2021, the most recent practicable date

Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 49)
As of August 6, 2021, three purported stockholders of Raven had filed actions in the United States District Court for the District of New York, captioned Stein
v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06215 (S.D.N.Y.), Hopkins v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06363 (S.D.N.Y.) and Maluga v.
Raven Industries, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06636 (S.D.N.Y.), alleging that a preliminary version of the proxy statement filed with the SEC on July 19, 2021
was materially incomplete, false or misleading in certain respects, thereby allegedly violating Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § §
78n(a), 78t(a)), and SEC Rule 14a-9 (17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9) or 17 C.F.R. § 244.100 promulgated thereunder. Each complaint names as defendants Raven and each
member of the Raven board of directors and purports to seek injunctive relief and money damages, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The defendants
believe the allegations in the action are without merit.

What will happen in the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Raven, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary will cease and
Raven will be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial. As a result of the Merger, Raven common stock will no

delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Raven will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to Raven common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

Immediately following the Merger, Raven will be a wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial.

the right to receive $58.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of Raven common stock that they own immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Q:
What will happen in the Merger to Raven equity awards?
A:
The Merger Agreement provides that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding equity awards of Raven will be treated as
follows:
Each Raven RSU that is outstanding under any Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented
by the Raven RSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven RSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the
holder of such Raven RSU. To the extent the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying a Raven RSU is based on the satisfaction ofperformance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (i) the target amount under the terms of
the applicable award agreement and (ii) the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award agreement based on
performance through the Effective Time,
13
Table of Contents
such performance to be determined by Raven’s reasonable determination of performance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any payment
in respect of Raven RSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest
time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code.
Each Raven DSU that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented
by the Raven DSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven DSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the
holder of such Raven DSU. Any payment in respect of Raven DSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven DSUs that constitute nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not
trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
Each Raven Stock Option that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, will automatically be canceled in
exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price of such Raven Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying the Raven Stock
Option. Any Raven Stock Option for which the exercise price is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without any
consideration.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement?
A:
South Dakota Law requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by
the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present or
represented by proxy). In addition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?
A:
The named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, approval of which is not required to complete the Merger, requires that the
number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the
virtual meeting website or represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement?
A:
The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, the approval of which is not required to complete the Merger, requires that the number of votes cast in
favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).
Q:
Do any of Raven’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a shareholder?
A:
In considering the recommendation of the Board to approve the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Raven’s directors and executive
officers have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Raven shareholders generally. The Board
was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in
recommending that the Merger Agreement be approved by the shareholders of Raven. See “The Merger—Interests of Raven Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 and “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal
2)” beginning on page 73.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
14
Table of Contents
A:
In order to complete the Merger, Raven must obtain the Shareholder Approval of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement described in this
proxy statement, and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the Merger Agreement
currently expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2021, although Raven cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all.
Because the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.
Q:
What conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger?
A:
There are several conditions which must be satisfied to complete the Merger, including, among other things, the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the receipt of CFIUS approval, compliance with certain other regulatory filings and obtaining certain
other regulatory approvals. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned on the other party’s representations and
warranties being true and correct (subject generally to a material adverse effect standard, with different standards applicable to certain
representations and warranties) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement (subject to
certain qualifications). Consummation of the Merger is not subject to any financing condition.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may
be paid by Raven to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?
A:
SEC rules require Raven to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve any agreements or understandings and compensation that will or may be
paid by Raven to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Approval of this proposal by Raven’s shareholders is not required to
complete the Merger.
Q:
Do you expect the Merger to be taxable to Raven shareholders?
A:
The exchange of Raven common stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be
taxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is August 4, 2021. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to attend and
vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The only class of stock that can be voted at the meeting is Raven common
stock. Each outstanding share of Raven common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting. At the close of business
on the record date, there were 35,917,637 shares of Raven common stock issued and outstanding, approximately 2% of which were held by Raven’s
directors and executive officers. We currently expect that all of Raven’s directors and all executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive
officer is obligated to do so.
Q:
Who may attend the special meeting?
A:
Only shareholders as of the close of business on August 4, 2021, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited guests of Raven may attend the
meeting via the virtual meeting website. “Street name” holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee) who wish to
vote at the special meeting must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your
shares at the special meeting.
Q:
Who is soliciting my vote?
A:
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and Raven will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. MacKenzie Partners has been retained to assist with the
solicitation of proxies. MacKenzie Partners will be paid a solicitation fee of approximately $15,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of
proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of Raven
common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or
by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by MacKenzie Partners or, without additional compensation, by certain of Raven’s
directors, officers and employees.

Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Raven common stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of the Merger. If you own shares of common stock as of the close of
business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the date of the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting,
but the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Raven common stock after the special meeting but before the Effective Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares after the special meeting but before the Effective Time, you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of common
stock through completion of the Merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. If the Merger is completed, the exchange agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of
Raven common stock for the Merger Consideration.
PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY OR OTHERWISE SEND THEM TO RAVEN, CNH INDUSTRIAL
OR THE PROXY SOLICITOR.
Q:
How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?
A:
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Raven
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a
quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or represented
by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat may adjourn the special meeting from time to time. Failure of a quorum to be present at
the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Raven to additional expense.
Q:
What if I abstain from voting?
A:
If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting on any of the three proposals, it will have no effect on the outcome of
such proposals.
Q:
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote over the internet, by mail, by telephone or by attendance via the virtual
meeting website?
A:
If you are a registered shareholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone, by mail or by attendance
via the virtual meeting website, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a
quorum exists.
If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee
may vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters such as the proposals to be voted
upon at the special meeting. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name” and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
If you fail to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card by mail, or vote via the internet, by telephone or by attendance via the virtual meeting
website, it will have no effect on the proposals.
Q:
What is a broker non-vote?
17
Table of Contents
A:
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the
beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.
Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this
proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Raven common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker or
other holder of record, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will
not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement.
If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted. A failure to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee to vote on the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement (assuming a quorum is present), the non-binding proposal regarding
merger-related compensation for Raven’s named executive officers (assuming a quorum is present) or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting
(assuming a quorum is present), including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the approval of the Merger Agreement, will have no effect on
the outcome of such proposals.
Q:
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record, any
shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms,
such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy
card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted
by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
A:
This means you own shares of Raven common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you may
own some shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In
these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for
any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive
comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that
accompanies that proxy card.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
A representative from EQ Shareowner Services will serve as the inspector of election.
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card or to vote over the internet or by
telephone.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
Raven intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be
filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Raven files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not approved by Raven shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Raven shareholders will not
receive any payment for their shares of Raven common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Raven will remain an independent public
company and shares of Raven common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq.

The Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Raven will be required to pay to CNH
Industrial a termination fee of $64 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that CNH Industrial will be required to pay the Company a
termination fee of $200 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a failure to obtain required
regulatory approvals. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Raven” beginning on page 69 of this proxy
statement and the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Termination Fee” beginning on page 70 for a discussion of the
circumstances under which such termination fees will be required to be paid.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about Raven?
A:
Raven will provide copies of this proxy statement and its 2021 Annual Report to shareholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, without charge to any shareholder who makes a written request to the Office of the Corporate Secretary at Raven
Industries, Inc., 205 E. 6th Street, P.O. Box 5107, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107. Raven’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings
may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of Raven’s website at www.ravenind.com. Raven’s website address is
provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and
is not incorporated in this proxy statement by reference by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another shareholder?
A:
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and
annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as
applicable, addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra
convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies.
Raven and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple shareholders who request a copy and
share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker
or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke
your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual
report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Raven if you are a shareholder of record. You can notify us by
sending a written request to P.O. Box 5107 Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107 Attn: Office of the Corporate Secretary, or calling (605) 336-2750.
Shareholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single
copy by notifying Raven at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Raven will promptly deliver, upon written or oral
request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single
copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.
Q:
Whom should I contact if I have any questions?
A:
If you have questions about the Merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire additional copies of this proxy statement
or additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you should contact:

At the special meeting, Raven shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:
·
A proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)” and “The Merger
Agreement,” beginning on pages 26 and 50, respectively, of this proxy statement;
·
A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, discussed under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Raven
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement; and
·
A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to
approve the Merger Agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement.
Raven shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement for the Merger to occur. If Raven shareholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger
will not occur. The vote on named executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the named executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger and vote not
to approve the Merger Agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on named executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on
either Raven or CNH Industrial. Accordingly, because Raven is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject
only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the Merger Agreement is approved and the Merger is consummated, and regardless of the outcome of the
advisory vote.
Raven does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If any other matters are
properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have
discretion to vote on these matters.",15,15

issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Any shares of Raven common stock held by
Raven are not considered to be outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special
meeting. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat
may adjourn the special meeting from time to time. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement and will subject Raven to additional expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of
determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned special
meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be

which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not
have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any
of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Raven common stock held in “street name” does not give voting
instructions to the broker or other holder of record, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is
expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. A failure to instruct your

mail; (ii) over the internet; or (iii) by telephone. Raven encourages you to vote over the internet as Raven believes this is the most cost-effective method. We

present at the special meeting and cannot be voted.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how

shareholders are also being asked to approve a proposal to, as permitted under the terms of the Merger Agreement, adjourn the special meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the Merger Agreement. If this proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by Raven. In addition, Raven could
postpone the meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other reasons. If the special meeting is adjourned
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use
at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your
shares will be voted in favor of such proposal.
The special meeting may be adjourned to another place, date or time, if the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes
opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special
meeting (assuming a quorum is present).
If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat may
adjourn the special meeting from time to time.
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Raven in accordance with South
Dakota Law. As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary will cease, and Raven will survive the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of CNH Industrial.
At the Effective Time, each share of Raven common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Raven, CNH
Industrial or any of their respective subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Upon consummation of the Merger, your shares of Raven common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and cease to exist
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. As a result, you will not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any
interest in its future earnings or growth. As a result of the Merger, Raven will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly owned by CNH
Industrial. Following consummation of the Merger, Raven’s common stock will be de-listed from the Nasdaq and Raven will no longer be subject to reporting
obligations under the Exchange Act.
At the Effective Time, each share of Raven common stock held by Raven (as treasury stock) or owned by CNH Industrial or any other subsidiary of CNH
Industrial will be canceled without payment of any consideration. At the Effective Time, each share of Raven common stock held by any subsidiary of Raven
or CNH Industrial will be converted into such number of shares of stock of the surviving corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock in the surviving corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in Raven
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation.
Each Raven RSU that is outstanding under any Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented by the Raven
RSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven RSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of such Raven
RSU. To the extent the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying a Raven RSU is based on the satisfaction of performance conditions, such
performance conditions will be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (i) the target amount under the terms of the applicable award agreement and (ii)
the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award agreement based on performance through the Effective Time, such performance
to be determined by Raven’s reasonable determination of performance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any payment in respect of Raven RSUs
and dividends accrued with respect to Raven RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not
permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven
Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
Each Raven DSU that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented by the Raven
DSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven DSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of such Raven
DSU. Any payment in respect of Raven DSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven DSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at
the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.
Each Raven Stock Option that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, will automatically be canceled in exchange for
the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price of such Raven Stock Option by (ii) the
26
Table of Contentsnumber of shares of Raven common stock underlying the Raven Stock Option. Any Raven Stock Option for which the exercise price is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without any consideration.
If, during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Raven common stock occurs
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, excluding
any change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement to purchase shares of Raven common stock granted
under Raven’s stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration will be appropriately adjusted.",17,18
RAVEN INDUSTRIES INC_20210806_DEFM14A_19454710_4273900.Pdf,Effects on Raven If the Merger Is Not Completed,"Effects on Raven If the Merger Is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not approved by Raven shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Raven shareholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of Raven common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Raven will remain an independent public company and shares
of Raven common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Raven shareholders will continue to
be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the industry in which Raven
operates, the servicing of Raven’s debt, market volatility and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be completed, it is likely that the
price of Raven common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Raven common stock would return to the
price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of
Raven common stock. If the Merger Agreement is not approved by Raven shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be
no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Raven will be offered or that Raven’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely
impacted.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Raven will be required to pay to
CNH Industrial a termination fee of $64 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that CNH Industrial will be required to pay the Company a termination
fee of $200 million under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. See
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Raven” beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement and the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Termination Fee” beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which
such termination fees will be required to be paid.

As part of the ongoing evaluation of the Company’s business, members of Raven’s senior management and the Board periodically review and assess the
Company’s operations, financial performance and industry conditions as they may each impact the Company’s long-term strategic goals and plans, including
reviewing potential opportunities to maximize shareholder value.
The Company and CNH Industrial previously entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement in May 2019 with respect to the sharing of confidential
information about various technology partnerships between the two companies in the ordinary course of business. Commencing in October of 2020,
representatives of the Company engaged in a series of discussions with CNH Industrial to explore a potential joint venture arrangement between the two
companies regarding precision agriculture. These discussions did not relate to a potential acquisition of the Company by CNH Industrial. As part of this
process, and pursuant to the mutual confidentiality agreement, the Company and CNH Industrial provided each other certain non-public due diligence
information. The Company and CNH Industrial entered into an amended and restated mutual confidentiality agreement on March 11, 2021 (the
“Confidentiality Agreement”). CNH Industrial also agreed to a customary standstill provision, expiring 90 days after the date of the Confidentiality
Agreement.
In December 2020, a party (“Bidder 1”) contacted the Company to discuss strategic options, including whether the Company would be interested in a sale of
the company to Bidder 1. In January of 2021, the Company communicated to Bidder 1 that it would not continue discussions regarding a possible sale of the
Company to Bidder 1.

discussions with CNH Industrial regarding a potential joint venture arrangement and the possibility of exploring other potential strategic alternatives.
On March 16, 2021, the Board engaged Davis Polk as outside legal counsel and met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in attendance. The Board reviewed with the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk the substance of the
discussions with CNH Industrial, as well as other potential strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan
presented a proposed process and timeline with respect to the exploration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company, and representatives of Davis
Polk provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties. After discussion, the Board authorized the Company, under the direction of the Company’s
management, to explore potential strategic alternatives in accordance with the proposed process and timeline presented at the Board meeting and to terminate
the ongoing discussions with CNH Industrial regarding a possible joint venture arrangement.
On March 17, 2021, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company informed CNH Industrial of the Company’s decision to no longer pursue a
possible joint venture arrangement with CNH Industrial and to instead initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the
entire company.
On March 18, 2021, the Company and CNH Industrial entered into a supplement to the Confidentiality Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed that,
notwithstanding the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement, CNH Industrial would be permitted to make confidential proposals to the
Company’s Board concerning an acquisition of the entire company.

attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process. The Board then discussed formally
engaging J.P. Morgan as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with a potential strategic transaction. Following discussion, the Board authorized the
engagement of J.P. Morgan for that purpose.

possible strategic transaction.
On April 12, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in
attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process and presented to the Board the list of
potential counterparties that members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan planned to reach out to. Members of the
Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan also discussed with the Board an additional company (“Company X”) that members of the
Company’s senior management, following discussions with representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan, determined not to include in the process due to
competitive concerns and concerns regarding Company X’s ability to obtain regulatory approval for a transaction with the Company. Following discussion,
the Board determined that management should proceed to contact the potential counterparties identified at the meeting, and agreed with the determination of
management to not contact Company X.
On April 12, 2021, at the direction of the Company, J.P. Morgan and members of the Company’s management contacted six parties, including CNH Industrial,
to assess their level of interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with the Company. Of those six parties, two parties executed confidentiality
agreements with the Company on April 16, 2021, and one party executed a mutual confidentiality agreement with the Company on April 19, 2021. All of the
confidentiality agreements contained a customary standstill provision. The Company and CNH Industrial also amended the Confidentiality Agreement on
April 15, 2021 to add a conflicts waiver with respect to the Company’s outside legal counsel.At the direction of the Company, between April 12, 2021 and April 19, 2021, J.P. Morgan sent process letters to the four parties that had executed
confidentiality agreements with the Company, including CNH Industrial, inviting them to submit first-round, non-binding proposals for an acquisition of the
Company by May 4, 2021. The letters stated that all first-round proposals should include an indication of the total price the bidder would be prepared to pay
to acquire 100% of the Company and to specify the bidder’s proposed form of consideration, key conditions and assumptions, intended business and
management strategy for the Company, financing sources, required approvals, anticipated timing, due diligence requirements and proposed transaction
structure.

On April 22, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in
attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process.
On April 26, 2021, a representative of Company X contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan who historically have served as relationship bankers to Company
X, which individuals subsequently contacted members of the Raven coverage team at J.P. Morgan (who are also members of the Raven deal team) to inquire
whether there was an ongoing process by the Company to explore a sale. After speaking with the Company, based on the discussion previously held at the
April 12 Board meeting, at the direction of the Company, the representatives of J.P. Morgan serving on the Raven coverage team (who are also members of the
Raven deal team) did not provide information to Company X or its relationship bankers concerning whether or not a process was ongoing.
On April 30, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for consideration per share in a range of between $47.00 to $51.00.
On May 4, 2021, the Company received additional non-binding proposals to acquire the Company from another party (“Bidder 2”) and CNH Industrial,
resulting in a total of three first-round proposals. CNH Industrial offered to purchase the Company for consideration per share of $48.00. Bidder 2 offered to
purchase the Company for consideration per share in a range of between $45.00 to $49.00.

attendance. The Board discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk the details of the three first-round proposals that were received and
potential next steps. The advisors then left the meeting and the Board went into executive session. Following additional discussion, the Board determined
that each of the three bidders should be requested to reconsider their proposals and provide indications of interest at an increased price.
Following the May 7, 2021 Board meeting, at the direction of the Company, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed each of CNH Industrial, Bidder 1 and
Bidder 2 that such bidder was invited to submit a revised indication of interest at an increased price by May 13, 2021 and that, following the submission of
such revised indication of interest, the Board would determine whether to admit such bidder into the second and final round of the bidding process.

proposed form of consideration, key conditions and assumptions, intended business and management strategy for the Company, financing sources, required
approvals, anticipated timing and certainty of closing (including confirmation of the completion of substantive due diligence), closing conditions and
proposed transaction structure. The letters also instructed bidders to submit a mark-up by June 8, 2021 of the bid draft merger agreement that would be
provided by Davis Polk.
Also on May 14, 2021, the three bidders received access to a virtual data room that contained detailed and confidential business, financial, operational, legal
and other information concerning the Company. The due diligence process with each of the bidders continued through June 14, 2021. During this period,
representatives of the Company and its advisors responded to numerous diligence requests from, and conducted several diligence calls with, each of the
bidders and their respective advisors.

Between May 18, 2021 and May 20, 2021, members of the Company’s senior management team hosted a management presentation with each of the three
bidders in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
On May 19, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared a bid draft merger agreement with each bidder. The bid draft merger
agreement furnished to each bidder was identical, except that with respect to CNH Industrial, the draft incorporated provisions concerning regulatory
approvals that would apply to a non-U.S. buyer.
On June 8, 2021, CNH Industrial and Bidder 2 each submitted mark-ups of the merger agreement.
On June 9, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared an initial draft of the Company’s disclosure schedules to the bid draft
merger agreement with each bidder.
On June 9, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a mark-up of the merger agreement.
On June 10, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in
attendance. The Board discussed with representatives of Davis Polk the terms of the bid draft merger agreement and the key issues raised in the mark-ups
received from each of the bidders. In particular, Davis Polk reviewed with the Board each bidder’s proposed revisions to the regulatory efforts covenant and
regulatory termination fee. All three bidders proposed limiting the buyer’s obligation under the regulatory efforts covenant to “reasonable best efforts” with
an additional proviso (i) in the case of CNH Industrial, that the buyer was under no obligation to (a) divest any material portion of the assets of the Applied
Technology operating segment of the Company (the “Applied Technology Division”) or agree to any restrictions on the business operations of the buyer
with respect to the Applied Technology Division in any material respect or (b) take any action that would have a material adverse effect on CNH Industrial
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured on a scale relative to Raven and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), and (ii) in the case of each of Bidder 1 and
Bidder 2, that the buyer was under no obligation to (a) agree to any divestiture or restrictions on business operations or (b) contest any proceeding relating
to the proposed transaction. Coupled with these proposed revisions to the regulatory efforts covenant, CNH Industrial proposed a 5% regulatory termination
fee, Bidder 1 did not make a proposal regarding the size of the regulatory termination fee, and Bidder 2 proposed a 3% regulatory termination fee. Following
discussion of these and other terms in the bidders’ mark-ups, the Board determined that the Company should provide feedback to each of the bidders with
respect to the key issues raised in such bidder’s mark-up and invite each bidder to submit a revised mark-up with its final bid.
On June 11, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Davis Polk held teleconference calls with the legal advisors of CNH Industrial and Bidder
1 to communicate the Company’s feedback on key issues raised in each bidder’s mark-up. Davis Polk also contacted the legal advisor of Bidder 2 to schedule
a teleconference call to discuss the key issues raised in Bidder 2’s mark-up. Bidder 2’s legal advisor indicated to Davis Polk that the legal advisor would need
to consult with Bidder 2 prior to scheduling a call, but there was no further contact between the legal advisors following that communication.
On June 14, 2021, Bidder 2 communicated to the Company that it would not be submitting a final offer.
On June 15, 2021, CNH Industrial submitted a final offer to acquire the Company for $58.00 per share in cash. The final offer from CNH Industrial was
accompanied by a revised mark-up of the draft merger agreement. Among other things, in the revised mark-up CNH Industrial (i) agreed to take all actions
required by a governmental entity to consummate the Merger so long as such action would not have a material adverse effect on the Applied Technology
Division or on CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured on a scale relative to Raven and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) and (ii)
proposed a 6% regulatory termination fee (approximately $120 million).
Also on June 15, 2021, Bidder 1 submitted a final offer to acquire the Company for an implied value of $55.50 per share, with such consideration to be
comprised of (i) $37.00 per share in cash and (ii) a fixed number of shares of Bidder 1’s common stock equivalent to $18.50 per share (based on the volume-
weighted average price of Bidder 1’s common stock, measured over the five-day trading period prior to announcement of the transaction). The final offer from
Bidder 1 was also accompanied by a revised mark-up of the draft merger agreement. Among other things, the revised mark-up (i) did not reflect any changes
to the regulatory efforts covenant proposed in Bidder 1’s initial mark-up but indicated in a footnote that Bidder 1 would be open to removing the proviso that
the buyer is under no obligation to contest any proceedings relating to the proposed transaction if the Company agreed to extend the outside date until any
such litigation is resolved and (ii) proposed a $100 million regulatory termination fee.

On June 15, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in
attendance. The Board discussed with the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk the details of the two final offer packages that were received and
potential next steps. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Company to continue discussions with each of CNH Industrial and Bidder 1.
On June 16, 2021, at the direction of the Company, Davis Polk sent Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, legal counsel to CNH Industrial, a mark-up of the draft merger
agreement that was submitted with CNH Industrial’s final bid. From June 16, 2021 until the execution of the Merger Agreement on June 20, 2021, the parties
and their respective legal advisors exchanged several drafts of, and engaged in numerous discussions and negotiations concerning the terms of, the Merger
Agreement and the Company’s disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement. Primary areas of discussion and negotiation included the scope of CNH
Industrial’s undertaking to obtain required regulatory approvals, the “no-shop” provisions, and various employee-related and intellectual property-related
matters. In connection with these negotiations, on June 17, 2021, CNH Industrial agreed to increase its regulatory termination fee to $200 million. During this
time, representatives of CNH Industrial and its advisors also performed additional confirmatory due diligence.
On June 17, 2021, at the direction of the Company, Davis Polk held a teleconference call with the legal advisors of Bidder 1 to communicate the Company’s
feedback on key issues in the revised mark-up of the draft merger agreement that was submitted with Bidder 1’s final bid. Significant areas of discussion
included the scope of Bidder 1’s undertaking to obtain required regulatory approvals, each party’s assessment of the antitrust risk associated with a
combination of the parties, the size of the proposed regulatory termination fee, the requirement proposed by Bidder 1 that the Company cooperate with Bidder
1 to facilitate the sale of certain assets or ownership interests held by the Company following the signing of a definitive merger agreement, the status of
Bidder 1’s financing arrangements and Bidder 1’s anticipated timing to reach a position to sign a definitive merger agreement. In connection with those
conversations, representatives of Bidder 1’s legal counsel informed representatives of Davis Polk that Bidder 1 would need approximately seven to ten days
before Bidder 1 would be in a position to sign a definitive merger agreement.
On June 18, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in
attendance. Representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan provided an update to the Board on their respective conversations with the legal and financial
advisors of CNH Industrial and Bidder 1.
On June 19, 2021, the Board received a letter from Bidder 1 reaffirming its interest in acquiring the Company and communicating certain changes that Bidder 1
was willing to make to its final offer package in an effort to address the concerns, as communicated between the parties’ legal advisors, with respect to the
potential antitrust risk associated with a combination of the Company with Bidder 1, including an increase in the regulatory termination fee proposed by
Bidder 1 from $100 million to $150 million and certain revisions to the scope of Bidder 1’s undertaking to obtain required regulatory approvals. There was no
change in Bidder 1’s previously communicated offer price of $55.50 per share. In its June 19 letter, Bidder 1 reiterated that announcement of a transaction with
the Company would not occur prior to one week from its June 19 letter.
On June 20, 2021, the Board met virtually, with certain members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk in
attendance. Prior to the meeting, the directors had received (i) a substantially final draft of the Merger Agreement negotiated with CNH Industrial, together
with a summary thereof prepared by Davis Polk, and (ii) a financial presentation prepared by J.P. Morgan. Representatives of Davis Polk reviewed with the
directors the fiduciary duties applicable to the Board’s consideration of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Board then discussed the June 19 letter
received from Bidder 1 with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Davis Polk. Following those discussions, the Board determined to proceed with a discussion
of the CNH Industrial transaction because it had both a superior price and superior terms compared to the proposal of Bidder 1 and could be executed
immediately. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Board the strategic review process it had undertaken at the request of the Board and its
financial analyses of the Merger Consideration in the proposed transaction with CNH Industrial. J.P. Morgan then rendered to the Board its oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed by the delivery of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion addressed to the Board dated June 20, 2021 to the effect that, as of such
date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration of
$58.00 per share to be paid to the holders of the Company’s common stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
shareholders. Representatives of Davis Polk then reviewed with the directors the terms of the Merger Agreement. Based on the discussions and deliberations
at this meeting and prior meetings, the various discussions and reviews with representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan, and various other factors,
including those described in “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Raven’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Raven Board of Directors,” the Board
unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby were fair to, and in the best interests of,
the

Company and its shareholders, (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and (3) recommended that the Company’s shareholders
approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.
Shortly after the Board meeting on June 20, 2021, the Company, CNH Industrial and Merger Subsidiary finalized the Company’s disclosure schedules to the
Merger Agreement and entered into the Merger Agreement.
Shortly after the execution of the Merger Agreement on June 20, 2021, the Company sent a letter to Bidder 1 communicating its decision to terminate further
discussions with Bidder 1.
Later on June 20, 2021, after the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Board received a letter from Bidder 1 reaffirming its interest in acquiring the Company
and revising the proposed purchase price from its letter on June 19, 2021 from $55.50 per share in cash and stock to $59.00 per share in cash. The letter also
requested exclusivity through the end of the day on June 28, 2021.
On June 21, 2021, the Company and CNH Industrial issued a joint press release before markets in the U.S. and Europe opened announcing their execution of
the Merger Agreement.
Also on June 21, 2021, the Company sent a letter to Bidder 1 informing Bidder 1 of the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement with CNH Industrial prior
to its receipt of the letter from Bidder 1 on June 20, 2021. The Company’s response noted that the Company’s ability to discuss the revised offer from Bidder 1
was limited by the terms of the Merger Agreement, which was also publicly filed on June 21, 2021 as an exhibit to a Form 6-K filed by CNH Industrial. There
has been no further contact between the Company and Bidder 1 regarding the acquisition of the Company since the Company’s June 21, 2021 letter.",18,20

At a meeting duly called and held on June 20, 2021, the Board determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
are fair to, and in the best interests of, Raven and its shareholders and approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board also resolved that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the shareholders of Raven at
a special meeting of shareholders and to recommend that the shareholders of Raven vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The Raven Board consulted withRaven’s outside financial and legal advisors and senior management at various times and considered a number of factors, including the following principal
factors (not in any relative order of importance) that the Board believed to support its decision:
·
Raven’s business, current and projected financial performance and condition and future prospects in relation to the Merger Consideration of $58.00
per share,
·
the current and historical market prices of Raven common stock, including the market performance of Raven common stock relative to other
participants in Raven’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration represented an attractive premium of
approximately 33.6% to Raven’s four-week volume-weighted average stock price,
·
the fact that J.P. Morgan, at the Board’s instruction, contacted six prospective buyers, that of these prospective buyers, four entered into
confidentiality agreements with respect to a potential transaction with the Company, two of which (including CNH Industrial) continued pursuing an
acquisition of the Company after conducting due diligence, and that the Company did not receive a more attractive alternative bid during the sale
process and prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement than the one submitted by CNH Industrial,
·
the fact that Raven did not enter into any exclusivity arrangements with CNH Industrial and did not negotiate with CNH Industrial on a contractually
exclusive basis,
·
the Board’s belief that its negotiations had resulted in the highest price per share for the common stock of the Company that CNH Industrial was
willing to pay,
·
the Board’s belief that the process conducted by the Company had resulted in the highest price reasonably available to the shareholders of the
Company,
32
Table of Contents
·
the Board’s belief that the Merger was more favorable to Raven’s shareholders than the alternative of remaining a standalone independent company,
which belief was based on and informed by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including:
o
general industry, economic and market conditions, both on a historical and on a prospective basis,
o
the risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Raven’s performance as a standalone company, including the risks and uncertainties
described in Raven’s SEC filings, and
o
the uncertain returns to Raven’s shareholders if Raven were to remain independent, taking into account, in particular, management’s
financial projections of the future financial performance and earnings of Raven, including those set forth below under “The Merger
(Proposal 1)—Certain Financial Projections” and the risks involved in achieving those returns.
·
the Board’s belief that the risks and challenges to Raven’s business described above, and in Raven’s SEC filings, create substantial execution risks
relative to the $58.00 per share price in the Merger,
·
the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board on June 20, 2021, which was subsequently confirmed by a written opinion, dated as of the
same date, addressed to the Board that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and conditions set forth in J.P. Morgan’s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Raven common
stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders, as described further under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Opinion of Raven’s Financial Advisor” and Annex B to this proxy statement,
·
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, so that the transaction will allow Raven’s shareholders to realize a fair value, in cash, for their
investment and provides such shareholders certainty of value for their shares,
·
the Board’s belief that absent a superior proposal, the Merger represented a transaction that would likely be consummated based on, among other
factors, the limited closing conditions to the completion of the transaction, the absence of a financing condition or similar contingency that is based
on CNH Industrial’s ability to obtain financing and the strong commitment made by CNH Industrial to obtain regulatory approvals, as further
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger,” and
·
the material terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
o
the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Raven’s
shareholders,
o
the Board’s “fiduciary out” with respect to third-party acquisition proposals likely to result in superior proposals, the Board’s ability to
negotiate with another party regarding a superior proposal and, subject to paying a termination fee to CNH Industrial in the amount of $64
million, accept a superior proposal,
o
the Board’s belief that, if triggered, the termination fee payable by Raven to CNH Industrial is consistent with fees payable in comparable
transactions and would not be likely to preclude another party from making a competing proposal,
o
the fact that Raven and CNH Industrial agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all necessary filings and obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals; CNH Industrial
has further agreed to take any such actions necessary to consummate the Merger that do not constitute a materially burdensome regulatory
condition (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger”),
o
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, CNH Industrial must pay
Raven a termination fee of $200 million,
33
Table of Contents
o
the scope of the representations, warranties and covenants being made by Raven, CNH Industrial and Merger Subsidiary,
o
the fact that the Merger Agreement is not subject to a financing condition and, in particular, that CNH Industrial had represented in the
Merger Agreement that it has, or will have at the Effective Time, sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to consummate the Merger, and
o
Raven’s ability to specifically enforce CNH Industrial’s obligation to cause the completion of the Merger to occur.
The Board also considered various potentially countervailing factors in its deliberations related to the Merger, including the following principal factors (not in
any relative order of importance):
·
the fact that the holders of common stock will not have an opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the combined company
following the Merger,
·
the possibility that the Merger might not be completed and the effect the termination of the transaction may have on the trading price of Raven
common stock, its business, operating results and prospects, which effect is likely to be exacerbated the longer the time period between the signing
and any termination of the Merger Agreement,
·
that Raven cannot solicit other acquisition proposals, and must pay CNH Industrial a termination fee in the amount of $64 million if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if the Board changes its recommendation to Raven’s shareholders to adopt the
Merger Agreement or exercises its right to enter into a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal, which may deter others from proposing an
alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Raven’s shareholders,
·
that the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the conduct of Raven’s business prior to completion of the Merger, requiring Raven to
conduct its business only in the ordinary course and imposing additional specific restrictions, may delay, limit or prevent Raven from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise during that period,
·
the possible effects of the pendency (or termination) of the Merger Agreement on Raven’s business, operating results, prospects, employees,
customers and suppliers,
·
the fact that if the Merger is not consummated, Raven will be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement,
·
the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes,
·
the fact that Raven is subject to various remedies available to CNH Industrial should it fail to complete the Merger or breach the Merger Agreement,
and
·
that if CNH Industrial fails to complete the Merger as a result of a breach of the Merger Agreement, depending upon the reason for not closing,
Raven’s rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce through litigation, and the success of any such action may be uncertain.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered by the Board. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor,
supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information it considered.
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and
executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among
other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be approved by the
shareholders of Raven. See the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated April 8, 2021, Raven retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to
deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Board on June 20, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
various factors, assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
Raven common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its June 20, 2021 oral opinion by
delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated June 20, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common
stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated June 20, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and
limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P.
Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Raven’s shareholders are urged to read the
opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its
evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger Consideration to be paid in the proposed Merger and did not address any other aspect
of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Raven or as to the underlying decision by Raven to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved
by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Raven as to how such shareholder should
vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
·
reviewed the Merger Agreement;
·
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Raven and the industries in which it operates;
·
compared the financial and operating performance of Raven and certain of its business segments with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of Raven common
stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
·
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Raven relating to its business and the business
of certain of its business segments; and
·
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the
purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Raven and CNH Industrial with respect to certain aspects of the
proposed Merger, and the past and current business operations of Raven, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Raven, and certain
other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to
or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Raven or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its
accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to J.P. Morgan’s engagement letter with Raven, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such
independent

verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the
solvency of Raven or CNH Industrial under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Raven to which such
analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also
assumed that the proposed Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger
Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by Raven and CNH Industrial in the Merger Agreement and the related
agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the
assessments made by advisors to Raven with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the proposed Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Raven or on the contemplated
benefits of the proposed Merger.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan as
of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not
have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any
consideration paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Raven or as to
the underlying decision by Raven to engage in the proposed Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of
any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the MergerConsideration to be paid to the holders of Raven common stock in the proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
The terms of the Merger Agreement were determined through arm’s length negotiations between Raven and CNH Industrial, and the decision to enter into the
Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. J.P Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board in
its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of Raven’s Board or management with respect to the proposed
Merger or the Merger Consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in rendering its opinion to the
Board on June 20, 2021 and contained in the presentation delivered to the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion, and this
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses
include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used
by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Raven with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged
in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous in certain respects to Raven and/or one or more of its businesses.
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan (collectively, the “Selected Companies”) were as follows:
Applied Technology
· Deere & Company
· Corteva, Inc.
· Garmin Ltd.
· CNH Industrial N.V.
· Trimble Inc.
· FMC Corporation
· AGCO Corporation

·
XPENG Inc.
·
Arrival Luxembourg SARL
·
Luminar Technologies, Inc.
·
Nikola Corporation
·
Velodyne Lidar, Inc.
·
Hyliion Holdings Corp.
The Selected Companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan’s
analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of Raven and/or one or more of its businesses. The Selected Companies may be
considered similar to Raven or such businesses based on the nature of their assets and operations; however, none of the companies selected is identical or
directly comparable to Raven or such businesses, and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Raven or
such businesses. J.P. Morgan’s analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect Raven or such businesses.
Using information obtained from the Selected Companies’ public filings and FactSet Research Systems as of June 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan calculated for each
Selected Company the ratio of such company’s firm value (calculated as the market value of the company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any
debt, debt-like items and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) to the equity research analyst estimate for such company’s (i) earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, or (ii) in the case of the Autonomy business, revenue, for 2023, calendarized
based on Raven’s January 31 fiscal year end, which we refer to as FV/ 2023E EBITDA.
Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its experience and judgment, J.P. Morgan selected
a multiple reference range for Raven of 11.5x to 22.5x for FV/ 2023E EBITDA.
After applying this range to Raven’s estimated EBITDA for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 based on the projections furnished to J.P. Morgan by
Raven’s management, as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Projected Financial Information” beginning on page 41 of
this Proxy Statement (the “Projections”), the analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value ranges for Raven common stock, rounded to the
nearest $0.25:

The ranges of implied per share equity value were compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62, and (ii) the Merger
Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.
Public Trading Multiples Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis
J.P. Morgan also conducted a sum-of-the-parts analysis of Raven, based on the Projections for each of Raven’s businesses identified above and for its
corporate services unit. Using the same information and calculations described above under “Public Trading Multiples Analysis”, J.P. Morgan calculated
ranges of implied values for each of the businesses by applying illustrative multiple ranges of FV/2023E EBITDA derived for each business to the following
metrics for each business, respectively, in each case based on the Projections for the relevant metric for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023:
·
estimated EBITDA for Applied Technology,
·
estimated EBITDA for Engineered Films,
·
estimated EBITDA for Aerostar,
·
estimated revenue for Autonomy, and
·
estimated EBITDA for Corporate Services.
J.P. Morgan then (i) aggregated the ranges of implied values for Raven (excluding its Autonomy business) and for Raven’s Autonomy business to derive an
implied total firm value range, (ii) subtracted net debt to arrive at an implied total equity value range and (iii) divided the implied total equity value range by
the number of fully diluted shares outstanding as provided by Raven management to arrive at an implied share price range. The analysis indicated the
following range of implied equity value per share for Raven common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25):

The ranges of implied per share equity value were compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62, and (ii) the Merger
Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value per share of Raven common stock. A
discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future cash flows generated by the asset and taking into
consideration the time value of money with respect to those cash flows by calculating the current value of the cash flows generated by the asset, which we
refer to as the present value and which is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-
economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. The present value of all future cash flows
generated by the asset for periods beyond the projections period is referred to as terminal value.
J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Raven, excluding Raven’s Autonomy business, is expected to generate from April 30, 2021 through
January 31, 2031, using the Projections. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Raven (excluding Autonomy) by applying a range of
terminal growth rates, as provided by Raven management, ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% to the unlevered free cash flows. The unlevered free cash flows and the
range of terminal values were then discounted to present values as of April 30, 2021 using a range of discount rates from 9.25% to
38
Table of Contents
10.25%, which range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Raven. J.P. Morgan then aggregated the
range of present values derived above to derive a range of illustrative enterprise values for Raven (excluding Autonomy).
In addition, using the Projections, J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Raven’s Autonomy business is expected to generate from April
30, 2021 through January 31, 2031. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Raven’s Autonomy business by applying a range of terminal
growth rates, as provided by Raven management, ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% to the unlevered free cash flows. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of
terminal values were then discounted to present values as of April 30, 2021 using a range of discount rates ranging from 16.00% to 17.00%, which range was
chosen by J.P. Morgan based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for Raven’s Autonomy business. J.P. Morgan then aggregated the range
of present values derived above to derive a range of illustrative enterprise values for Raven’s Autonomy business.
J.P. Morgan then (i) added the range of illustrative enterprise values for Raven businesses to derive a range of illustrative aggregate enterprise values for
Raven, (ii) subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values the amount of Raven’s net debt as of April 30, 2021 as provided by Raven management
to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Raven, and (iii) divided the illustrative aggregate equity value range by the number of fully diluted shares
outstanding as provided by Raven management to arrive at an implied share price range. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share
equity value reference range for Raven common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, which was compared to (i) the closing price of Raven common stock on
June 18, 2021 of $38.62 and (ii) the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis
J.P. Morgan performed a discounted cash flow sum-of-the-parts analysis of Raven to calculate the present value of the standalone unlevered free cash flows
that each of Raven’s businesses identified above under “—Public Trading Multiples Analysis” and its corporate services unit were forecasted to generate
from April 30, 2021 through January 31, 2031 based on the Projections. J.P. Morgan also calculated terminal values for each Raven business by applying a
range of terminal growth rates, as provided by Raven management, ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% for each business (other than Autonomy) and 2.5% to 3.5% for
Raven’s Autonomy business. The unlevered free cash flows and terminal values for each business were discounted to present value as of April 30, 2021. J.P.
Morgan then (i) aggregated the ranges of implied values for each business to derive an implied total firm value range, (ii) subtracted net debt to arrive at an
implied total equity value range and (iii) divided the implied total equity value range by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding as provided by Raven
management to arrive at an implied share price range. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for

Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the historical prices of Raven common
stock during the 52-week period ending on June 18, 2021, and noted that such prices ranged from $19.84 to $47.43 per share, and compared that to (i) the
closing price of Raven common stock on June 18, 2021 of $38.62 and (ii) the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share of Raven common stock.
Analyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed certain publicly available equity research
analyst share price targets for Raven common stock obtained from FactSet Research Systems, and noted that these share price targets ranged from $47.00 to

Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes
that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses,
without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for
analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Raven. The order of analyses described does
not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular
weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in
determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the Selected Companies reviewed as described in the above
summary is identical to Raven. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses
that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Raven. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies
compared to Raven.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Raven with respect to the
Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with
Raven and the industries in which it operates.
For services rendered in connection with the Merger, Raven has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a transaction fee that is estimated, based on information available
as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $28,000,000, $3,000,000 of which became payable following delivery of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and the
remainder of which is contingent and payable upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Raven has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses
incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out
of J.P. Morgan’s engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had, and continue to have, commercial or investment
banking relationships with Raven and CNH Industrial, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received, or will receive, customary compensation. Such
services during such period for Raven have included acting as its financial advisor in connection with its strategic planning in February 2021, and such
services during such period for CNH Industrial have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities by CNH Industrial Capital LLC,
a subsidiary of CNH Industrial, in June 2020. Neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial
or investment banking relationships with Exor N.V. (“Exor”),

which holds approximately 26.9% of the shares and 42.5% of the voting rights in CNH Industrial, during the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s
opinion. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of Raven, CNH
Industrial and Exor. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Raven were
approximately $50,000 and from CNH Industrial were approximately $1,000,000, and no fees were recognized from Exor during such period. In the ordinary
course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank
loans or other obligations) of Raven, CNH Industrial or Exor for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers, and, accordingly, they may at any time
hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
Projected Financial Information",22,25
RAVEN INDUSTRIES INC_20210806_DEFM14A_19454710_4273900.Pdf,Projected Financial Information,"Projected Financial Information
Raven does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the current fiscal year and is especially wary of
making projections for extended earnings periods due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, Raven prepared financial projections in May 2021 (the “Projections”), which were prepared as part of the strategic review process and
provided to CNH Industrial, Bidder 1 and Bidder 2. In addition, the Projections were provided to the Board and to J.P. Morgan for use by J.P. Morgan in its
financial analyses as described further under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Opinion of Raven’s Financial Advisor.”
We have included a summary of certain of the Projections below to give shareholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Board for
purposes of considering and evaluating Raven’s strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger, and to J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial
analyses. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that CNH Industrial, Raven or the Board, J.P. Morgan, any of their
respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an
assurance of the achievement of future results.
The Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure. The financial projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are
the responsibility of, Raven’s management. The financial projections were prepared solely for internal use of Raven and are subjective in many respects.
Projecting future performance is difficult, and given the extended timeline of the Projections, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in the market
acceptance of and timing for advanced autonomous solutions, there is an increased level of unpredictability in the Projections. Although a summary of the
financial projections is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management
that our management believed were reasonable at the time the financial projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to
management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. In
addition, the financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give
effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the financial projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse
than those contained in the financial projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, Raven, J.P. Morgan
or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the forecasts to be predictive of actual future results.
The Projections are unaudited and were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles as applied
in the U.S. (“GAAP”) or the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Neither the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to
the financial projections or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the financial projections or their achievability. The Company’sindependent registered public accounting firm assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the financial projections.
The Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Raven’s future results to materially vary or the Projections not to
be achieved, see the section entitled “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 20 of this proxy statement.
Subject to the foregoing qualifications, a summary of the Projections is set forth below:

RAVEN INDUSTRIES INC_20210806_DEFM14A_19454710_4273900.Pdf,Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,"Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board to approve the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Raven’s directors and executive officers have
certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Raven’s shareholders generally. The Board was aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger
Agreement be approved by the shareholders of Raven. These interests are described and quantified below.
Equity-Based Awards
Raven’s executive officers currently hold vested and unvested Raven Stock Options and Raven RSUs, while Raven’s directors hold Raven DSUs.
The Merger Agreement provides that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding equity awards of Raven (including awards held by
Raven’s executive officers and directors) will be treated as follows:
·
Each Raven RSU that is outstanding under any Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented by the
Raven RSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven RSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of
such Raven RSU. To the extent the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying a Raven RSU is based on the satisfaction of performance
conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (i) the target amount under the terms of the applicable
award agreement and (ii) the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award agreement based on performance through the
Effective Time, such performance to be determined by Raven’s reasonable determination of performance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Any payment in respect of Raven RSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject
to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the
earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of
earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.
·
Each Raven DSU that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether vested or not vested, will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Raven common stock represented by the Raven
DSU. Any accrued but unpaid dividends granted with respect to a Raven DSU will automatically vest and be paid or distributed to the holder of such
Raven DSU. Any payment in respect of Raven DSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven DSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid without triggering a tax
42
Table of Contents
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Raven Stock Plan and applicable award
agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
Each Raven Stock Option that is outstanding under a Raven Stock Plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, will automatically be canceled in exchange for
the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price of such Raven Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Raven common stock underlying the Raven Stock Option. Any Raven Stock Option
for which the exercise price is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without any consideration.
See “Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement for
an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each named executive officer of Raven in respect of his or her unvested Raven Stock Options and
Raven RSUs.
Change in Control Agreements
On June 20, 2021, the Personnel & Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board approved the entry by Raven into Amended and Restated
Change in Control Agreements (collectively, the “Amended Change in Control Agreements”) with certain executives of Raven, including Daniel A. Ryhkus,
Taimur Sharih, Steven Brazones, Scott Wickersham, Lee Magnuson, Anthony Schmidt and Nicole Freesemann (together, the “CiC Participants”). The
Amended Change in Control Agreements for the CiC Participants provide that in the event of a termination of the CiC Participant’s employment by Raven
without Cause or by the CiC Participant due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in the Amended Change in Control Agreements) within
two years following a change of control (which will include the Merger), the CiC Participant will be entitled to the following severance benefits: (i) the product
of (x) the sum of (A) the CiC Participant’s annual base salary in effect as of the CiC Participant’s termination and (B) the CiC Participant’s target bonus amount
under Raven’s short-term incentive plan (the “STIP”) for the year of termination, and (y) a multiple, with such multiple being equal to three for Mr. Rykhus,
two for Mr. Brazones and Mr. Sharih, and one-and-one-half for Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Wickersham, Mr. Magnuson and Ms. Freesemann; (ii) a prorated bonus
under the STIP based on the greater of (A) the applicable target bonus amount and (B) the reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance
metrics for the entire fiscal year in which the termination occurs; provided, however, that such bonus will not be duplicative of any bonus to which such CiC
Participant is entitled under the Merger Agreement for such fiscal year; (iii) reimbursement of the employer portion of the CiC Participant’s COBRA premiums
for up to eighteen months following the CiC Participant’s termination; and (iv) the accelerated vesting of any performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) in an
amount equal to the greater of (A) the target amount of such PSUs and (B) an amount based on actual performance through the change in control. In
addition, Mr. Schmidt will vest in his post-retirement benefits upon such a termination of his employment (Mr. Rykhus has already met the requirements for
retirement eligibility and his benefits are fully vested).
In connection with Raven’s entry into the Amended Change in Control Agreements, Raven also entered into amended and restated employment agreements
with Mr. Rykhus and Mr. Brazones (collectively, the “Amended Employment Agreements”). Under the Amended Employment Agreements, the severance
benefits provided to Mr. Rykhus and Mr. Brazones upon or following a change in control were removed in recognition of Raven’s entry into AmendedChange in Control Agreements with Mr. Rykhus and Mr. Brazones. The Amended Employment Agreements amend and restate in their entirety each of Mr.
Rykhus’s and Mr. Brazones’s existing employment agreements with Raven.
Retention Program
In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Committee also approved the adoption of a retention program under which Raven may pay cash-
based retention bonuses (the “Retention Bonuses”) to up to 183 employees of Raven in an aggregate amount of up to $10.3 million (the “Retention
Program”). Retention Bonuses under the Retention Program will include potential payments of $1,230,000 to Mr. Rykhus, $390,000 to Mr. Sharih, $597,000 to
Mr. Brazones, $180,000 to Mr. Schmidt, $345,000 to Mr. Wickersham, $338,000 to Mr. Magnuson and $382,500 to Ms. Freesemann. Subject to their continued
employment through the applicable vesting date, up to 50% of each participant’s award under the Retention Program will vest and be payable within 60 days
following the closing of the Merger and at least 50% of such participant’s award under the Retention Program will vest and be payable six months following
the closing of the Merger (or three months in the case of Mr. Rykhus), subject, in each case, to earlier vesting and payment upon a termination of the
participant’s employment by Raven without Cause or by the participant due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in the individual award
agreements under the Retention Program).

Table of Contents
See “Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement for
the estimated amounts that each of Raven’s named executive officers would receive under his or her Amended Change in Control Agreement and the
Retention Program upon a qualifying termination of employment.
Annual Bonuses
If the closing of the Merger occurs before the date annual bonuses for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 (or, if applicable, January 31, 2023) are paid
under any Raven annual cash incentive compensation plan or arrangement (each, a “Closing Year Bonus Plan”), the bonus amount required to be paid to
participating Raven employees under the applicable Closing Year Bonus Plan will be the greater of (A) such participant’s target bonus amount under the
Closing Year Bonus Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) such participant’s bonus amount under the Closing Year Bonus Plan
based on Raven’s reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics for the entire fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs;
provided, however, that any bonus amount payable under a Closing Year Bonus Plan for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 will be prorated based on the
number of days in such fiscal year prior to the closing date, and CNH Industrial will provide participating Raven employees with an additional annual bonus
opportunity for the remainder of such fiscal year in a manner consistent with the Merger Agreement. The determination of the anticipated achievement of the
applicable performance metrics will be based on Raven’s reasonable determination of such achievement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Annual
bonuses under each Closing Year Bonus Plan will be paid within thirty (30) days after the closing date.
Compensation Payable to Raven’s Directors and Non-NEO Executive Officers
The estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to Raven’s non-management directors in respect of their Raven DSUs are set forth in the table
below. None of the non-management directors are parties to an Amended Change in Control Agreement or participate in the Retention Program.

Based on the assumptions described in the section entitled “Interests of Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation” below, Nicole Freesemann, Raven’s Vice President of Human Resources and an executive officer, is entitled to receive the following estimated
amounts of compensation that are payable in connection with or otherwise relate to the Merger and that will or may become payable to Ms. Freeseman either
immediately on the consummation of the Merger or on a qualifying termination of employment within two years after the Merger: (i) $820,120 in respect of her
unvested Raven Stock Options and Raven RSUs and (ii) $1,030,474 under her Amended Change in Control Agreement and the Retention Program.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The table below sets forth, for each of Raven’s named executive officers (“NEO”), estimates of the amounts of compensation that are payable in connection
with or otherwise relate to the Merger and that will or may become payable to the NEO either immediately on the consummation of the Merger or on a
qualifying termination of employment within two years after the Merger. Raven’s shareholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
such compensation for the NEO’s (see the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Arrangements
(Proposal 2)” beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement). Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either
Raven or CNH Industrial. Accordingly, if the Merger is approved by Raven’s shareholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation for the NEOs will
be payable regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable to the vote to approve
the Merger, which are described in the footnotes to the table and above under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Raven Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement.
44
Table of Contents
The estimates in the table assume that the Merger will become effective on December 1, 2021 and that, immediately after the consummation of the Merger,
each NEO’s employment will be terminated by Raven without Cause or by the NEO due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in the
Amended Change in Control Agreements or in the NEO’s individual award agreement under the Retention Program, as applicable). See the footnotes to the
table for additional assumptions.
Brian E. Meyer, Raven’s former Division Vice President and General Manager – Applied Technology, whose employment terminated on January 5, 2021, is
considered a named executive officer for purposes of this Golden Parachute Compensation section of this proxy statement. Mr. Meyer does not have any
interest in the Merger or any rights to compensation that are based on or otherwise related to the Merger other than to the extent to which he continues to
hold outstanding service-vested PSUs and may be a holder of Raven common stock.

(a) For purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this table, the following assumptions were used. The actual amounts
payable following a termination of employment would depend on the date of termination, the manner of termination and the terms of the agreements in effect
at such time.
·
It is assumed that the Merger will be consummated on December 1, 2021.
·
Each NEO is assumed to experience a termination without Cause or for Constructive Termination (if applicable under the terms of the
applicable Amended Change in Control Agreement) immediately following the consummation of the Merger.
·
Compensation levels on the date of termination are assumed to be the same as those as of the date of this proxy statement.
(b) Amounts are equal to a multiple of each NEO’s base salary and target bonus, which is calculated as follows: (i) the product of (x) the sum of (A) the NEO’s
annual base salary in effect as of the NEO’s termination and (B) the NEO’s target bonus amount under the STIP for the year of termination, and (y) a multiple,
with such multiple being equal to three for Mr. Rykhus, two for Mr. Brazones and Mr. Sharih, and one-and-one-half for Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Wickersham and Mr.
Magnuson.
46
Table of Contents
(c) This represents the target bonus amount under the STIP. The ultimate amount to be received by the NEO pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
will be based on the greater of (A) the applicable target bonus amount and (B) the reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics
for the entire fiscal year in which the termination occurs. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Employee Matters” for a description of the
treatment of the bonuses under the STIP under the terms of the Merger Agreement.
(d) Up to 50% of the Retention Bonuses under the Retention Program will vest and be payable within 60 days following the closing of the Merger and at least
50% of the Retention Bonuses will vest and be payable six months following the closing of the Merger (or three months in the case of Mr. Rykhus), subject, in
each case, to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. In addition, any unpaid portion of the Retention Bonuses will vest and become
payable upon a termination of the NEO’s employment by Raven without Cause or by the NEO due to a Constructive Termination (as such terms are defined in
the individual award agreements under the Retention Program).
(2) The following table provides additional information regarding the equity award holdings of each NEO that will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration (net of the applicable exercise price in the case of Raven Stock Options) on a single-trigger basis in connection with the consummation of the
Merger. With respect to RSUs that are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, the values of the RSUs set forth in the tables assume
achievement of performance at target level. For Mr. Meyer, the value of his RSUs represents the target amount prorated for the period of time between the
applicable grant date and his termination of employment.

(3) Amount equal to the employer portion of the NEO’s COBRA premiums for up to eighteen months following the NEO’s termination.
(4) Annual benefits would begin under the applicable policy immediately for NEOs eligible for retirement or at age 65 for the other NEOs and they would
continue until the later of the NEO’s or spouse’s death; provided that, the supplemental medical benefits for Mr. Schmidt will continue only until the NEO’s
death. Mr.Rykhus has met the requirements for retirement eligibility and his benefits are fully vested. As Mr. Rykhus is not entitled to any additional benefits
that are payable in connection with or otherwise relate to the Merger, no values are included in this column for Mr. Rykhus.
(5) Based on the current cost of the benefit. The program provides that the retiree will pay no more than active executives for coverage.
(6) Amounts included in this column represent the maximum aggregate annual reimbursement amount that Mr. Schmidt would receive over his lifetime,
assuming for these purposes that Mr. Schmidt’s life expectancy is that of the average male in the United States. The actual expenses submitted to the plan
each year may be less than the maximum annual reimbursement amount.
(7) The amounts included in these columns are double-trigger payments.

The completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals having been obtained and remaining in full force

warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; may be subject to limitations
agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by the disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement; were made for the purposes of

incorporation of Raven will be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the articles of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except (a) to change the name of the surviving corporation to “Raven Industries, Inc.” and (b) as otherwise required by the Merger
Agreement to maintain in effect provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of officers, directors, employees, fiduciaries and

Merger will become effective at such time as the articles of merger are duly filed with the South Dakota Secretary of State or at such later time as may be
specified in the articles of merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, completion
of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, which are described below, and it is possible that
factors outside the control of Raven or CNH Industrial could delay the completion of the Merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a
substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the Merger. We expect to complete the Merger promptly following the receipt
of all required approvals.

At the Effective Time, each share of Raven common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Raven, CNH
Industrial or any of their respective subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Raven common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and will thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
At the Effective Time, each share of Raven common stock held by Raven (as treasury stock) or owned by CNH Industrial or any other subsidiary of CNH
Industrial will be canceled without payment of any consideration. At the Effective Time, each share of Raven common stock held by any subsidiary of Raven
or CNH Industrial will be converted into such number of shares of stock of the surviving corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock in the surviving corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in Raven

Prior to the Effective Time, CNH Industrial will appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Raven for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Raven common stock or (ii) uncertificated shares of Raven common stock. At or prior to the Effective
Time, CNH Industrial will make available to the exchange agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the certificates representing shares of Raven
common stock or uncertificated shares of Raven common stock.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than two business days thereafter), CNH Industrial will send, or cause the exchange agent to send, to each
holder of shares of Raven common stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of certificates representing shares of Raven common stock or transfer of uncertificated shares of
Raven common stock to the exchange agent) for use in such exchange.
Each holder of shares of Raven common stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive, upon (i)surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the
exchange agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the exchange agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
uncertificated shares, in each case (i) or (ii), the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Raven common stock represented by a certificate or
uncertificated share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such certificate or uncertificated share will represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.
If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate or the transferred
uncertificated share is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that (i) either such certificate be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such uncertificated share be properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment must pay to the exchange agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of such payment or establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Raven common stock. If, after the Effective Time, certificates
representing shares of Raven common stock or uncertificated shares of Raven common stock

are presented to the surviving corporation or the exchange agent, they will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the exchange agent for payment to the shareholders that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Raven common stock twelve months after the Effective Time will be returned to CNH Industrial, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Raven common stock will thereafter look only to CNH Industrial for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries) will not be
liable to any holder of Raven common stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar applicable
laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Raven common stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of CNH
Industrial free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.",30,31

amount under the terms of the applicable award agreement and (ii) the amount based on the actual performance level achieved under such award
agreement based on performance through the Effective Time, such performance to be determined by Raven’s reasonable determination of
performance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any payment in respect of Raven RSUs and dividends accrued with respect to Raven

award agreement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

Many of Raven’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are qualified by a “Material Adverse Effect” standard (that is, they will not be
deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect). For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Material Adverse Effect” means a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), business, assets, operations or results of operations of Raven and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding any effect, directly or indirectly,
resulting from:

providers, counterparties or governmental authorities (including the failure to obtain any consents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement);
·
Any failure by Raven and its subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections, forecasts or predictions of financial
performance for any period (provided that the exception in this clause shall not preclude CNH Industrial from asserting that any underlying

underlying facts giving rise or contributing to such change should be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Material
Adverse Effect).
Notwithstanding these exclusions, any effects referred to in the first five bullets will be taken account in determining whether a “Material Adverse Effect” has

Raven has agreed under the Merger Agreement to cause a meeting of Raven shareholders to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purpose of voting to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger. In connection with the meeting of Raven shareholders, Raven is required to (i) use
its reasonable best efforts to have the proxy statement and all proxy materials for the shareholder meeting cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable and
(ii) mail the proxy statement and all other proxy materials for the shareholder meeting to Raven shareholders as promptly as practicable after clearance by the
SEC.
Under the Merger Agreement, subject to the provisions described below in “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”
and “The Merger Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendation” beginning on pages 59 and 61, respectively, of this proxy statement, the Board is
required to (i) recommend approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by Raven
shareholders, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approval, (iii) not affect an adverse recommendation change (as described below)
and (iv) otherwise comply in all material respects with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting.
Raven is not permitted to postpone, adjourn, recess or otherwise delay the meeting of Raven shareholders or, after Raven has established a record date for
such meeting, change the record date or establish a different record date for such meeting unless Raven is required to do so by applicable law or its
organizational documents, except (i) with the prior written consent of CNH Industrial, (ii) for the absence of a quorum (in which case Raven will, and will
instruct its proxy solicitor to use reasonable best efforts to, solicit as promptly as practicable the presence, in person or by proxy of a quorate number of
shares of Raven common stock), or (iii) after consultation with CNH Industrial, if Raven reasonably believes that such adjournment, postponement, recess or
delay is necessary (and to the extent required, change the record date in connection therewith) to allow reasonable additional time (x) for the filing and mailing
of any supplemental or amended disclosure which Raven’s Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under
applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Raven’s shareholders prior to the Raven shareholder
meeting, or (y) to solicit additional proxies in order to obtain the Shareholder Approval; provided that, if Raven delivers a notice of an intent to make an
adverse recommendation change within five business days prior to the original date that the Raven shareholder meeting is scheduled, at CNH Industrial’s
request, Raven will, as promptly as practicable thereafter postpone, adjourn or recess the Raven shareholder meeting for up to five business days in
accordance with CNH Industrial’s direction.

Raven has agreed that from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, except as otherwise set forth below, Raven and its subsidiaries will not, and will cause their respective directors, officers and employees, and
instruct their investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, “representatives”) not to, directly

or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal;
·
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Raven or any of its subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Raven or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way

·
fail to make (including by failing to include in the proxy statement), withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to CNH Industrial the
recommendation by Raven’s Board in favor of the Merger Agreement (or recommend an acquisition proposal) (any of the foregoing in this
bullet, an “adverse recommendation change”);
·
fail to enforce or grant a waiver or release under a standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of Raven or any of
its subsidiaries;

approve any transaction under, or any person becoming an “interested shareholder” under the business combination provisions of South

·
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar
instrument relating to an acquisition proposal; or
·
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.
Raven also agreed in the Merger Agreement to (and agreed to cause its subsidiaries to) cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party and its representatives with respect to any acquisition proposal and to send written notice
demanding that any such third party or its representatives in possession of nonpublic information in respect of Raven or its subsidiaries return or destroy all
such information, and that it would promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such persons.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, (i) Raven or any of its representatives receives a
bona fide acquisition proposal that the Board reasonably believes, after consultation with Raven’s financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a “superior proposal” (as described below) and (ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Raven may:
·
Enter into or engage in negotiations or discussions with such third party and its representatives; and
·
Furnish to such third party or its representatives nonpublic information relating to Raven or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement that meets certain standards; provided that Raven is required to promptly provide to CNH Industrial any such information that is
provided to any such person which was not previously provided to or made available to CNH Industrial.
In addition, the Board is not permitted to take any of the actions referred to in the above bullets unless Raven has first delivered to CNH Industrial prior
written notice advising CNH Industrial that it intends to take such action.
Raven is required to keep CNH Industrial promptly informed after taking any action referred to in the above bullets of the status and material terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the applicable third party with respect to any acquisition proposal. In addition, Raven is required to notify CNH Industrial
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by Raven (or any of its representatives) of any acquisition proposal or any request for information
relating to Raven or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Raven or any of its subsidiaries by any third
party that is considering making, or has made, an acquisition proposal, which notice must include the material terms and conditions of any such acquisition
proposal or request. Raven is required to keep CNH Industrial
60Table of Contents
informed as to the status and details of any such acquisition proposal or request on a reasonably prompt basis, including promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours of receipt) providing to CNH Industrial copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to Raven or any of its subsidiaries that
describes any terms or conditions of any acquisition proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters) or
any amendment thereto.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “acquisition proposal” means any proposal, offer, inquiry or indication of interest from any third party providing for:
·
Any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Raven or 25% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of Raven or any of its subsidiaries, whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated
assets of Raven;
·
Any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity
or voting securities of Raven or any of its subsidiaries, whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of Raven; or
·
A merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Raven or any of its subsidiaries, whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or
more of the consolidated assets of Raven.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “superior proposal” means a bona fide, written acquisition proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Raven common stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Raven and its subsidiaries on terms that the Board determines in good faith,
after considering the advice of a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, are more favorable to Raven’s shareholders than those provided in the Merger
Agreement (taking into account (x) any proposal by CNH Industrial to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement and (y) all of the terms and conditions of
such acquisition proposal (including any legal, financial, regulatory and governmental approval and stockholder approval requirements and the financing
thereof)).
Changes in Board Recommendation",34,35
RAVEN INDUSTRIES INC_20210806_DEFM14A_19454710_4273900.Pdf,Changes in Board Recommendation,"Changes in Board Recommendation
At any time prior to obtaining the approval of Raven’s shareholders, the Board is permitted to make an adverse recommendation change (i) following receipt
of a superior proposal that did not result from a willful and material breach of the no-shop covenant or (ii) in response to an “intervening event” (as described
below), in each case, only if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that:
·
Raven promptly notifies CNH Industrial in writing at least five business days before taking such action, attaching (A) in the case of an adverse
recommendation change to be made following receipt of a superior proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under which
such superior proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third party making the superior proposal, or (B) in the case of an
adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such
adverse recommendation change;
·
Raven negotiates in good faith with CNH Industrial (if requested by CNH Industrial) for five business days following such notice regarding any
proposal by CNH Industrial to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement in response to such potential adverse recommendation change; and
·
The Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Raven’s financial advisor, that CNH Industrial has not
made, within such five business day period, an offer that (A) in the case of any adverse recommendation change to be made following receipt of
a superior proposal, is at least as favorable
61
Table of Contents
to Raven’s shareholders as such superior proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material
terms of such superior proposal shall require a new written notification from Raven and a new three business day period) or (B) in the case of an
adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, obviates the need for such adverse recommendation change.
Nothing in the Merger Agreement prevents Raven or its Board from:
·
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act;
·
making any legally required disclosure to shareholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or an acquisition
proposal provided that any adverse recommendation change involving or relating to an acquisition proposal may only be made in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement;
·
issuing a “stop, look and listen” disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act; or
·
contacting and engaging in discussions with any person or group and their respective representatives who has made an acquisition proposal
that was not solicited in breach of the no-shop covenant solely for the purpose of clarifying such acquisition proposal and the terms thereof.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, an “intervening event” means any material event, change, occurrence, effect or development arising after the date of
the Merger Agreement that was not known by nor was reasonably foreseeable (with respect to substance or timing) to the Board as of the date of the Merger
Agreement; provided, that in no event shall any of the following events, changes, occurrences, effects or developments be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether an intervening event has occurred: (x) the receipt of an acquisition proposal or a superior proposal or any inquiry or communications
or matters relating thereto; or (y) the announcement, pendency and consummation of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any actions expressly required
to be taken or to be refrained from being taken pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger
The completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals having been obtained and remaining in full force
and effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals that are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated), including the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of CFIUS approval. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
each of Raven and CNH Industrial agrees to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i)
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any governmental authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any governmental authority that are necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
CNH Industrial acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such regulatory clearances includes taking, or causing to
be taken, and doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including divestitures, hold separate arrangements, the termination, assignment, novation or modification of contracts or other
business relationships, the acceptance of restrictions on business operations, the entry into other commitments and limitations, and litigation, including with
governmental authorities, to obtain the approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders, waivers,

non-objections and other confirmations required to be obtained from any governmental authority to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; provided that CNH Industrial will not be required to (x) proffer to, agree to, or take any action, including accept any restrictions on
business operations or enter into other commitments or limitations on the freedom of action of CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries (including, after the closingof the Merger, Raven and its subsidiaries), that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the Applied Technology Division, or (y) proffer to, agree to or take any
action that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of CNH Industrial and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (measured on a scale
relative to Raven and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (any action set forth in clause (x) or (y), a “materially burdensome regulatory condition”).
CNH Industrial and Raven will (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen business days after the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii)
make all appropriate filings, notices, applications or similar documents required under any non-U.S. antitrust law as promptly as practicable, and (iii) take all
actions with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) as may be advisable under applicable law to obtain CFIUS approval,
including (A) submitting a draft CFIUS joint voluntary notice in accordance with Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. § 4565), and all
rules and regulations thereunder, including those codified at 31 C.F.R. Part 800 et seq. (the “DPA”) as promptly as practicable after the signing of the Merger
Agreement, (B) submitting a final CFIUS joint notice to CFIUS after promptly resolving all comments to the draft CFIUS joint voluntary notice from CFIUS and
(C) in the case of a CFIUS declaration, submitting a CFIUS joint voluntary notice if CFIUS so requests or informs CNH Industrial and Raven that it is not able
to conclude action under the DPA with respect to the Merger on the basis of such CFIUS declaration. Each of CNH Industrial and Raven shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any governmental authority for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and
requests in connection with the matters contemplated by this section, including responding to any request for information from CFIUS in the applicable
timeframe set forth in the DPA, subject to any extensions of such time that may be granted by CFIUS staff upon the request of a party to the CFIUS joint
notice and (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any governmental authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties to the Merger Agreement. CNH Industrial
agrees that it shall not agree to withdraw or resubmit the final filing submitted to CFIUS without the prior written consent of Raven. For purposes of the
Merger Agreement, “CFIUS approval” means that any of the following shall have occurred: (a) CFIUS has concluded that none of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger) is a “covered transaction” subject to review under the DPA; (b) CFIUS has issued a written
notice that it has completed a review or investigation of the notification voluntarily provided pursuant to the DPA with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger), and has concluded all action under the DPA; or (c) CFIUS has sent a report to the President
of the United States requesting the President’s decision on the CFIUS joint notice and (i) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to
suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger) or (ii) the President has announced a decision not to
exercise authority under the DPA to prohibit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger) within 15 days after the date on
which the President received such report from CFIUS.
As promptly as possible, Raven and CNH Industrial will submit, or cause to be submitted, a notification regarding the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the Department of State (the “DDTC”) pursuant to Section 122.4(b) of the U.S. International
Traffic in Arms Regulation set forth in 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 and 130 (“ITAR”). The Company shall promptly prepare any amendments and license transfer
requests, or take any other necessary steps, if requested by CNH Industrial, to transfer current permits applicable to the business that are issued pursuant to
the applicable provisions of U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.), ITAR, the Export
Controls Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.), the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. 730 et seq.), the Foreign Trade Regulations (15 C.F.R. Part 30),
the U.S. anti-boycott laws and regulations and associated executive orders related to any such applicable laws relating to exports to the countries where
Raven and its subsidiaries conduct business, including U.S. government export and import licenses, agreements and other approvals, to CNH Industrial or
such entity as CNH Industrial shall designate. No later than five days after the date of the closing of the Merger, CNH Industrial shall file a material change
notice with DDTC as required under the ITAR, at 22 C.F.R. § 122.4(a). For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “DDTC approval” means that 60 days shall
have elapsed after the filing of a notification regarding the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement with DDTC pursuant to Section 122.4(b) of
the ITAR, or that DDTC shall have provided the parties a written notice that it has concluded its review of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

Raven will also cooperate with CNH Industrial to ensure that Raven promptly submits the appropriate filings with or notices to Defense Counterintelligence
and Security Agency of the Department of Defense (“DCSA”) with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not
limited to a pro forma draft SF-328 reflecting Raven’s impending change of ownership and control, and to comply with requirements of DCSA, including
pursuant to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, applicable to it, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide any information
about its possession or control requested by DCSA in connection with DCSA’s review of the Merger and the foreign ownership, control or influence
following the completion of the Merger, in order to obtain the DCSA approval. To the extent not prohibited by DCSA, Raven shall (x) keep CNH Industrial
fully informed of material contacts, filings and discussions, including negotiations, with DCSA relating to the foregoing and (y) shall, to the extent feasible,
invite representatives of CNH Industrial to participate in conversations or negotiations with DCSA about any DCSA-suggested mechanisms to mitigate the
national security risks of foreign ownership, control or influence “FOCI mitigation” applicable to it, to the extent permitted by DCSA. Raven and CNH
Industrial shall cooperate to ensure that any FOCI mitigation agreement agreed to with DCSA imposes on Raven and CNH Industrial the fewest restrictions
on governance rights and information access consistent with the requirements of DCSA, applicable law and regulations. For purposes of the Merger
Agreement, “DCSA approval” means the acceptance by DCSA of the parties’ signed commitment letter to mitigate foreign ownership, control or influence
with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.
CNH Industrial will (i) offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) with respect to itself, Raven and its and Raven’s respective subsidiaries all
actions necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments under any applicable law that may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement so as to enable the consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event prior to July 1, 2022); provided that in no event shall CNH Industrial be required to take, offer to take or agree to take any action that would
constitute a materially burdensome regulatory condition; and (ii) not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire (by merger,
consolidation or otherwise) any person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if such acquisition or agreement would
reasonably be expected to jeopardize the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or would reasonably be
expected to delay beyond July 1, 2022, or restrain, prevent, enjoin, materially increase the risk of not obtaining any necessary consents of any governmental
authority or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
At the request of CNH Industrial, Raven will agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or assets of Raven or any of its subsidiaries (but, absent such request, Raven shall not take
any such action); provided that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. Raven and its subsidiaries shall not take or agree to take any actions that would constitute a materially burdensome regulatory condition
without the prior written consent of CNH Industrial which, without limiting CNH Industrial’s obligations under this section, may be granted or withheld in
CNH Industrial’s sole discretion.
Each party will (i) promptly notify the other parties of any written responses to or communication to that party from any governmental authority and, subject
to applicable law, permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed written communication in respect thereof; (ii) not participate or agree to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any governmental authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning matters in
connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such governmental authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and
(iii) furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any governmental authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to
any matters in connection with the Merger Agreement.
Litigation Related to the Merger
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Raven will control the defense or settlement of any litigation or other legal proceedings against Raven or any of its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided that Raven (i) will give CNH Industrial reasonable opportunity to
participate, at CNH Industrial’s expense, in such litigation or legal proceedings and (ii) agrees that it will not settle any such litigation or legal proceedings
without the prior written consent of CNH Industrial, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

From and after the Effective Time, CNH Industrial will honor, or will cause one of its subsidiaries (including Raven) to honor, all contractual obligations under
Raven’s employee plans. For twelve months following the closing of the Merger, CNH Industrial will provide each Raven employee who is employed
immediately prior to the closing of the Merger (including any Raven employee who is not actively working on the date of the closing of the Merger as a result
of an approved leave of absence) and who remains in the employ of CNH Industrial, Raven or any of its subsidiaries after the closing of the Merger (a
“Continuing Employee”), (i) a base compensation and target annual cash bonus opportunity in each case that is no less favorable than the base
compensation and target annual cash bonus opportunity to which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, (ii)
long-term compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable in value to the aggregate equity and other long-term incentive opportunities to
which such employee was entitled immediately prior to the closing of the Merger and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding severance)
that are at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other compensation and employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. Additionally, for twelve months following the closing of the Merger, CNH Industrial will provide employee
severance protections to such Continuing Employees that are no less favorable than the greater of (i) the severance protections or other termination-related
benefits that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under Raven’s severance policies and (ii) the severance benefits maintained for
similarly situated employees of CNH Industrial at the time of such Continuing Employee’s termination of employment.

Plan will be the greater of (A) such Continuing Employee’s target bonus amount under the Closing Year Bonus Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) such Continuing Employee’s bonus amount under the Closing Year Bonus Plan based on Raven’s reasonably anticipated achievement

Closing Year Bonus Plan for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 will be prorated based on the number of days in such fiscal year prior to the date of the
closing of the Merger, and CNH Industrial will provide such Continuing Employees with an additional annual bonus opportunity for the remainder of such
fiscal year in a manner compliant with the Merger Agreement. The determination of the anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics will be
based on Raven’s reasonable determination of such achievement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Annual bonuses under each Closing Year
Bonus Plan will be paid within thirty (30) days after the closing of the Merger.
CNH Industrial will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) recognize the pre-closing service of participating Continuing Employees for all purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate, benefit entitlement and benefit plan accrual under any employee benefit plans established, maintained or contributed to by CNH
Industrial that cover any of the Continuing Employees following the closing of the Merger, except for benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or,
to the extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods for participating Continuing Employees and (iii) provide credit to each participating Continuing Employee
under the applicable CNH Industrial plan for amounts paid by the Continuing Employee prior to the closing of the Merger during the year in which the
closing of the Merger occurs under any analogous employee plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms of such plan.
CNH Industrial will cause Raven and its subsidiaries to continue to credit under any applicable CNH Industrial employee plans each Continuing Employee for
all paid time off and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the closing of the Merger, except to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.
Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by CNH Industrial in writing, Raven will cause Raven’s 401(k) plan to be terminated effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In the event that CNH Industrial requests that Raven’s 401(k) plan be terminated, Raven will provide CNH Industrial with evidence that such
plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which will be subject to review and reasonable comment by CNH Industrial) not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In connection with any termination of Raven’s 401(k) plan, CNH Industrial will permit each Continuing Employee
who is a participant in the Raven 401(k) plan to (i) become a participant in a 401(k) plan of CNH Industrial that is an “eligible retirement plan” (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) immediately after the Effective Time and (ii) to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions”

For six years after the Effective Time, CNH Industrial has agreed to, and to cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former directors and officers of Raven and its subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an “indemnified person”), from and against any
losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in respect of the indemnified persons’ having served in such
capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent provided under South Dakota Law and Raven’s articles of incorporation and bylaws in
effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.
For six years after the Effective Time, CNH Industrial has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect the provisions in its articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the surviving corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of the Merger Agreement.
Prior to the Effective Time, Raven will or, if Raven is unable to, CNH Industrial will cause the surviving corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully
pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of Raven’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance
policies and Raven’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O insurance”), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, subject to certain
minimum requirements and other conditions.
If Raven or the surviving corporation for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O insurance in place as of the date of the MergerAgreement with Raven’s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Raven’s current insurance carrier with
respect to D&O insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Raven’s
existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or the surviving corporation will purchase from Raven’s current insurance carrier or from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Raven’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O insurance comparable D&O insurance for such
six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in Raven’s existing policies as of the date of
the Merger Agreement. In no event will CNH Industrial or the surviving corporation be required to expend for the D&O insurance an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for Raven’s existing policies. If the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.
If CNH Industrial, the surviving corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of CNH Industrial or the
surviving corporation, as the case may be, will assume the obligations described above.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Raven is required to submit a proposal to Raven
shareholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by Raven of certain compensation that will or may be paid by Raven to its named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachutes,” and which we refer to
as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, gives Raven shareholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
on the named executive officer merger-related compensation. This compensation is summarized in the table under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of
Raven Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement, including thefootnotes to the table.
The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Raven approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Raven hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the agreements or understandings with and compensation to
be paid or become payable by Raven to its named executive officers that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t)
of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute Compensation table, the footnotes to that table and the accompanying narrative disclosure.”
The vote on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the named executive officer merger-related compensation is a vote separate and apart
from the vote on the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the
named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation
proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Raven or CNH Industrial. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is approved and the Merger is
completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote
of Raven shareholders.
The above resolution approving the named executive officer merger-related compensation on an advisory basis will require that the number of votes cast in
favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or
represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid
by Raven to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger.

purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the Merger Agreement. If this proposal to adjourn the special meeting is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by Raven as
permitted under the terms of the Merger Agreement to any date. In addition, Raven, as permitted under the terms of the Merger Agreement, could postpone
the special meeting before it commences, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve Merger Agreement. If the special
meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any
time prior to their use. If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of such proposal.
Raven does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal has been approved at a special meeting.
The special meeting may be adjourned to another place, date or time, if the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes
opposing the proposal measured by the stock power in attendance via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special
meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).
If a quorum is not present, a majority of the Raven shareholders present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereat may

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",41,42
RAVEN INDUSTRIES INC_20210806_DEFM14A_19454710_4273900.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to “U.S. holders” and “non-U.S. holders” (in each case, as defined below)
of Raven common stock. This discussion applies only to holders that hold their Raven common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of
the holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:
·
Dealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Raven common stock;
·
Persons holding Raven common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction, integrated transaction or constructive
sale transaction;
·
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
·
Partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
·
Persons who acquired Raven common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;
·
Certain financial institutions and insurance companies;
·
Regulated investment companies;
·
Real estate investment trusts;
·
Certain former citizens or residents of the United States;
·
Tax-exempt entities, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth IRA;” or
·
Persons subject to the United States alternative minimum tax.
If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Raven common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a
partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Raven common stock and partners in
such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.
This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary Treasury regulations, all as of the date
hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax considerations under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Raven common stock that is:
·
A citizen or resident of the United States;
·
A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or
·
An estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
The exchange of Raven common stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder
whose shares of Raven common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined
separately for each block of shares of Raven common stock (i.e., shares of Raven common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain
or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding
77
Table of Contents
period in the shares of Raven common stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S.
holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Capital gains
recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.
Non-U.S. Holders
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Raven common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership. Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange
for shares of Raven common stock pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
·
The gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States);
·
The non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares of
Raven common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger and certain other conditions are met; or
·
The non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the Raven common stock at
any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger, and Raven is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder
held Raven common stock.
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S.
holder were a U.S. holder. If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively
connected earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at arate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even
though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.
Raven believes that it is not, and has not been, a United States real property holding corporation.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Raven common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the holder is an “exempt recipient”
and may also be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24%. To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption
should complete and return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided
is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. A non-U.S. holder that provides the applicable withholding agent with an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.
Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.
You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular circumstances as well as any tax
consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax laws.

If the Merger is completed, we may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2022. If the Merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to
attend and participate in our annual meetings of shareholders, and we will hold a 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, in which case we will provide notice of
or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which such 2022 annual meeting will be held. If the 2022 annual meeting is held, shareholder proposals will be
eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders in accordance with Rule 14a-8
under the Exchange Act and our bylaws, as described below.
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any shareholder who desires to submit a proposal for action by the
shareholders at the Company’s 2022 annual meeting must submit such proposal in writing to, Raven Industries, Inc., Attention: President and CEO, P.O. Box
5107, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107, in a timely manner. In order to be included in the Company’s proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting,
shareholder proposals must be received by the Company no later than December 10, 2021, and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8.
Shareholder proposals received after December 10, 2021, will not be included in the Company’s proxy statement relating to the 2022 annual meeting.
For shareholder proposals or director nominations that a shareholder seeks to bring before the 2022 annual meeting but does not seek to have included in the
Company’s proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting, the advance notice provisions contained in the Company’s bylaws will apply. In general,
notice must be received by the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Company first
mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year’s annual meeting. The notice must also contain specified information concerning the matters or director
nominees to be brought before such meeting and concerning the shareholder proposing such matters or nomination. Therefore, to be presented at the
Company’s 2022 annual meeting, such a proposal must be received by the Company on or after January 9, 2022, but no later than February 8, 2022. If the date
of the annual meeting is altered by more than 30 days from the date in the previous year, different deadlines will apply.
Due to the complexity of respective rights of the shareholders and the Company in this area, any shareholder desiring to propose such an action is advised to
consult with his or her legal counsel with respect to such rights. It is suggested that any such proposal be submitted by certified mail, return receipt
requested.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual
reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed
to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost
savings for companies.
Raven and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple shareholders who request a copy and share an
address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or
we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If at any
time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker if
your shares are held in a brokerage account or Raven if you are a shareholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to P.O. Box 5107 Sioux
Falls, South Dakota 57117-5107 Attn: Corporate Secretary, or calling (605) 336-2750. Shareholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of
the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Raven at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence.
In addition, Raven will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a
shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

Company or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in ​​Section 2.02(b) or ​Section 2.02(c)​, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive $58.00 in cash, without interest (such per share amount, the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with ​​Section 2.03.
(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held
for the account of third parties) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.
(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such
number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock in the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange
Agent”) for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the “Certificates”) or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the
aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Such funds
may be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable hereunder and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional
12
Table of Contents
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the shareholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall only be in
short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Standard & Poor’s Corporation or
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as Parent directs. The parties acknowledge and agree that such funds are owned by Parent for Tax purposes, until paid pursuant to the terms hereof and,
accordingly, any income earned on such amounts will be treated as income of Parent. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than two Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time notice advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall include appropriate transmittal instructions (including, if applicable, a letter of transmittal),
which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent, for use in such exchange.
(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
Article 2 surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or Article 3 receipt of an “agent’s message”
by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive such Merger Consideration.
(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that Article 4 either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be
in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and Article 5 the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ​​Article 2.
13
Table of Contents
(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to ​Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this ​​Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to establish customary procedures with the Exchange Agent with respect
to the prompt transmission to the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee of immediately available funds of an aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration with respect to the number of shares of Company Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(g) Parent, Exchange Agent, and the Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If Parent or the Exchange Agent determines that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld, Parent shall
provide the payee reasonable advanced written notice of the intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the estimated amount to be
deducted and withheld. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The parties agree that no withholding is currently required under Applicable Law with respect to consideration payable

the holder thereof, be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the

dividends accrued with respect to Company RSUs, that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not
permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time

outstanding under a Company Stock Plan, whether or not vested, shall, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof, be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares
of Company Stock represented by such Company DSU and Article 9 all dividends, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to
Company DSUs outstanding under a Company Stock Plan, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiaries thereof, shall vest
and

dividends accrued with respect to Company DSUs, that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not
permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

occurring at least five Business Days after the Closing Date), pursuant to the Company’s or Surviving Corporation’s ordinary payroll practices, and shall be

Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of options
outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan or compensation plans or arrangements, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement.
Section 2.06. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange

believes, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ix) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives,
may (A) enter into or engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided

Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof.
(d) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in ​​Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a
prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue to advise Parent on a
reasonably prompt basis of the status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions
44

of any such Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed as to the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or
request on a reasonably prompt basis, including promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours of receipt) providing to Parent copies of all correspondence
and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well
as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters) or any amendment thereto.
(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change (i) following receipt of a Superior Proposal that did not result from a willful and material breach of this ​Section 6.03 or (ii) in response to an Intervening
Event, in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;
provided that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to ​​Section

attaching (A) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior Proposal, the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal, or
(B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for
making such Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall
have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such potential Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) the Board of Directors of
the Company has determined in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and the Company’s financial advisor, that Parent has not made,
within such five Business Day period, an offer that (A) in the case of any Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior
Proposal, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and a new three Business Day
period under this ​Section 6.03(e)​) or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, obviates the need
for such Adverse Recommendation Change.

of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse
45

Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to ​​​Section 10.01(d)(i)) unless such Acquisition
Proposal would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal.
(g) As used in this Agreement:
(i) “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement (A) in effect on the date hereof or (B) that contains provisions that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such confidentiality

known by nor was reasonably foreseeable (with respect to substance or timing) to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this

purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred: (x) the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal or any inquiry

actions expressly required to be taken or to be refrained from being taken pursuant to this Agreement.

those provided hereunder (taking into account (x) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to ​Section 6.03(e) and (y)
all of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any legal, financial, regulatory and governmental approval and stockholder
approval requirements and the financing thereof)).

entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) protected by attorney-client privilege to the extent such privilege cannot be protected by the Company through exercise of
its reasonable best efforts.

Agreement all notices, acknowledgments, waivers, consents, amendments, supplements or other modifications required under any binding agreement or
contract to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound (the “Third-Party Consents”) and that are reasonably necessary or advisable to
be given, obtained and/or effected in order to consummate the Merger; provided, that in connection therewith, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to, or shall without the prior consent of Parent (which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting.
Section 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:
(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified Person”) from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable
in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified Persons’ having served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each case
to the fullest extent the Company would be permitted to do so by South Dakota Law and the Company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the
date hereof. If any Indemnified Person is made party to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to matters that would be
indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance fees, costs and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation; provided, that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is

maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s articles of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of
the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of fees, costs
and expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and
officers’ insurance policies and the Company’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O Insurance”), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies with respect to
any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by
reason of his or her having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as

D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company’s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Company’s current
insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance
comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the Company’s existing policies; and provided,
further, that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or Article 23 transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this ​Section 7.03.

opportunity to which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) long-term compensation opportunities that are
substantially comparable in value to the aggregate equity and other long-term incentive opportunities to which such Continuing Employee was entitled

Company Employee Plan that is an annual cash incentive compensation plan or arrangement (each, a “Closing Year Bonus Plan”), the bonus amount

bonus amount under the Closing Year Bonus Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) such Continuing Employee’s bonus amount
under the Closing Year Bonus Plan based on the Company’s reasonably anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics for the entire fiscal
year in which the Effective Time occurs; provided, however, that any bonus amount payable under a Closing Year Bonus Plan for the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2023 shall be prorated based on the number of days in such fiscal year prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall provide Continuing Employees
with an additional annual bonus opportunity for the remainder of such fiscal year in a manner that is compliant with Section 7.04(a). The determination of the
anticipated achievement of the applicable performance metrics shall be based on the Company’s reasonable determination of such achievement as of

accrual under any employee benefit plans established, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Affiliates that cover any of the Continuing
Employees following the Closing (collectively, the “Parent Plans”), except for benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or, to the extent such
service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods for participating Continuing Employees and (iii) provide credit to each participating Continuing Employee under the
applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid by the Continuing Employee prior to the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs under any analogous

had been paid in accordance with the terms of such Parent Plan.
(e) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to credit under any applicable Parent Plans each Continuing Employee for all paid time off
and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the Closing, except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits.
(f) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall cause the Company’s 401(k) Plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”)

by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In connection with any termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall permit
each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Company 401(k) Plan to (i) become a participant in a 401(k) plan of Parent that is an “eligible retirement

contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the
case of participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such Continuing Employee
from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan effective as of the Closing Date.
(g) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any
such comments in good faith.

including any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an
amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(iii) shall prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective

Company shall not take any such action); provided that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, $1.00 par value (the “Company Common
Stock”), of Raven Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the
Company with a wholly- owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2021
(the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, CNH Industrial South Dakota, Inc., the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or by any
subsidiary of the Company, or owned by the Acquiror and its affiliates, will be converted into the right to receive $58.00 per share in cash (the
“Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company and certain of its
business segments with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (iv) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and
forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business and the business of certain of its business segments; and (v) performed such
other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and the Acquiror with respect to certain aspects of the
Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and
certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
