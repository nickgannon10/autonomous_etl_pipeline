The Company retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) to act as its financial advisor in
connection with a potential transaction such as the Merger. At a meeting of the Ping Identity Board held on
August 2, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered the Ping Identity Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
its written opinion dated August 2, 2022, that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.50 in cash per share of Ping Identity
common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to holders of such shares.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 2, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its
opinion for the information and assistance of the Ping Identity Board in connection with its consideration of the
Merger. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Goldman Sachs in rendering its opinion. The holders of
Ping Identity common shares should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holder of Ping Identity shares should vote with respect to the transaction or any other

In the event that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement does not receive the required approval from
the holders of Ping Identity common stock, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the

with an exercise price per share less than $28.50 that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding, whether
vested or unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and

The Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Ping Identity Board were aware of
and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and deem the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated by the Merger
Agreement to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and in
recommending that stockholders vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. These interests include:
the Company’s executive officers and directors hold equity-based awards that will be afforded the
treatment described immediately above under “Treatment of Equity Awards”;
the Company’s executive officers are party to existing letter agreements with the Company that
provide for severance benefits; and
the Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and
insurance coverage following the Merger under the Merger Agreement. Please see the section of this

We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will
be approximately $2.8 billion, which will be funded via equity financing described below.
The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing
condition. Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Ping Identity that they will have available to them
sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the Merger by Parent and
Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
In connection with the financing of the Merger, the Thoma Bravo Fund has entered into an equity
commitment letter in favor of Parent, dated as of August 2, 2022 for the commitment to purchase up to
$2,842,183,289 of the equity securities of Parent (the “Equity Commitment Letter”), solely for the purpose of
allowing Parent and/or Merger Sub to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment of certain of the
Company’s indebtedness and to pay the related fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the
closing of the Merger. Ping Identity is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter
solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter
by the Thoma Bravo Fund to be funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, and to
cause Parent to enforce its rights against the Thoma Bravo Fund to perform its funding obligations under the
Equity Commitment Letter, in each case subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the limited guaranty delivered by the Thoma Bravo Fund in favor of Ping Identity, dated as of
August 2, 2022 (the “Limited Guaranty”), the Thoma Bravo Fund has agreed to guarantee the performance
and payment of certain liabilities and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement,

The consummation of the Merger is subject to review under the HSR Act. As described above in the section
titled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions of the Merger,” the obligations of Parent and the Company to

the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until
notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the Federal Trade Commission

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Ping Identity stockholders, if the Ping Identity Board
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Ping Identity Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as

The Ping Identity Board generally is not permitted under the Merger Agreement to change its
recommendation to the Company’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement. However, prior to the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by Ping Identity stockholders, the Ping Identity Board is permitted to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined below in the section titled “The Merger
Agreement - No-Shop; Ping Identity Board Recommendation Change”) in response to certain unforeseen,
intervening events or to accept a Superior Proposal if, in either case, the Ping Identity Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any such Company Board Recommendation Change is subject
to the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, including that the Company negotiates in good faith
with Parent and its representatives, if requested by Parent, for three business days (or two business days
following an amended Acquisition Proposal) to make amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and related documents so that, as applicable, the Ping Identity Board’s fiduciary duties no longer
require it to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to the intervening event or the

Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, Ping Identity stockholders who continuously hold shares of Ping
Identity common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands, and who
otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares of Ping Identity common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL. The “fair value” of shares of Ping Identity common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration that stockholders would
otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of
their shares of Ping Identity common stock.
The right to seek appraisal will be lost if a Ping Identity stockholder votes “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. However, abstaining or voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in itself
sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to perfect such rights. To
exercise appraisal rights, Ping Identity stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of
their shares must so advise the Company by submitting a written demand for appraisal (or by electronic
transmission directed to an information processing system, if any, expressly designated for that purpose in
the notice of appraisal) to the Company prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special
Meeting, and must otherwise strictly follow the applicable procedures and requirements prescribed by
Section 262 of the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Ping Identity common stock held
of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, may perfect appraisal
rights if such beneficial owner (1) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the
shares for which the demand is made, (2) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s
beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it
purports to be and (3) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given
by the Company and the office of Register in Chancery. In addition, under Section 262 of the DGCL, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have
perfected their appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%

The receipt of cash by a holder of Ping Identity common stock who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) in
exchange for shares of Ping Identity common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state,
local or foreign income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a U.S.
holder, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive
(or are deemed to receive) in the Merger and your adjusted tax basis in the shares of Ping Identity common
stock converted into cash in the Merger. If you are a holder of Ping Identity common stock who is a non-U.S.
holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations”), the Merger will generally not be a taxable transaction to you under U.S.
federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States, or the Company is, or was
during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. Further, the Merger may be a taxable
transaction to you under non-U.S. tax laws, and you are encouraged to seek tax advice regarding such
matters. Because individual circumstances may differ, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to
determine the particular tax effects to you.

Tax Considerations” for a more complete discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of

When and where is the Special Meeting of our stockholders?
The special meeting will be held virtually on Monday, October 17, 2022, at 3 pm, Eastern time. Ping Identity is

tools. Stockholders will be able to attend the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/​PING2022SM and by using the 16-digit control number included in their
proxy materials.
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
Only holders of record of Ping Identity common stock as of the close of business on September 12, 2022, the
record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to vote the shares of Ping Identity common stock they held
as of the record date at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
86,281,946 shares of Ping Identity common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. On each of the
proposals presented at the Special Meeting, each holder of Ping Identity common stock is entitled to one
vote for each share of Ping Identity common stock held by such stockholder on the record date.
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
Ping Identity is hosting the Special Meeting virtually. There will be no physical location for stockholders to
attend. Stockholders will be able to attend the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/​PING2022SM and by using the 16-digit control number included in their
proxy materials.
Stockholders of record: If you are a stockholder of record, in order to participate in the Special
Meeting, you will need your 16-digit control number included on the proxy notice, proxy card or the
voting instruction form previously distributed to you. If you are a stockholder of record, you may
vote electronically during the Special Meeting by following the instructions available at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/PING2022SM.
Stockholders holding shares in “street” name: If your shares are held in “street name” through a
brokerage firm, bank, trust or other similar organization and you do not have a 16-digit control
number, in order to participate in the Special Meeting, you must first obtain a legal proxy from your
broker, bank or other nominee reflecting the number of shares of Ping Identity common stock you
held as of the record date, your name and email address. If you hold your Ping Identity common stock
in “street name,” you must obtain the appropriate documents from your broker, bank, trustee, or
nominee, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Special Meeting.
Instructions on how to attend and participate in the Special Meeting via the webcast are posted at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/PING2022SM.
You should ensure that you have a strong Internet connection and allow plenty of time to log in and ensure
that you can hear streaming audio prior to the start of the Special Meeting. We will offer live technical
support for all stockholders attending the meeting. Technical support phone numbers will be available on the
virtual-only meeting platform at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/PING2022SM.
What proposals will be considered at the Special Meeting?
At the Special Meeting, holders of Ping Identity common stock will be asked to consider and vote on the
following proposals:
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”);
a proposal to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the specified compensation that may be
paid or become payable to Ping Identity’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger
(the “Compensation Proposal”); and
11 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Pursuant to Ping Identity’s Amended and Restated By-Laws, the only business that will be transacted at the
Special Meeting are the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, as
stated in the accompanying notice of the Special Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Ping Identity
common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is
present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence
of a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is
the adjournment or postponement of the meeting to another date or time.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the
outstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record
date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s
failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Proposal.
The approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis, requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of shares of Ping Identity common stock present, in person or represented by proxy.
Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s
failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation
Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal. The
approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory and non-binding and is not a condition to the
completion of the Merger.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of shares of Ping Identity common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on
such matter. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record
holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such
holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the
Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment
Proposal.
What is a “broker non-vote”?
If a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or
other nominee does not provide the organization that holds the owner’s shares with specific voting
instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner’s shares may generally vote
on “discretionary” matters but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote”
results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for
which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because
they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Ping Identity does not expect any broker non-votes
at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide
brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the
proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or
other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of Ping Identity common stock at the Special Meeting
without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote
12 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
your shares of Ping Identity common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.
How does the Ping Identity Board recommend that I vote?
The Ping Identity Board recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal and
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Ping Identity Board considered in determining to recommend that
Ping Identity stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, please see the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger - Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Ping Identity Board.” In addition, in
considering the recommendation of the Ping Identity Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that certain of the Company’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. Please see the section
of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger.”
Why am I being asked to cast an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or may
become payable to Ping Identity’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
The SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
adopted rules that require the Company to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain
payments that may be made to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
What will happen if the Company’s stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Ping
Identity, the Ping Identity Board, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because Ping Identity is
contractually obligated to pay the compensation, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the holders of Ping
Identity common stock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this advisory, non-binding vote.
What happens if I sell my shares of Ping Identity common stock before the Special Meeting?
The record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer
your shares of Ping Identity common stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will
retain your right to vote such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares. In order to receive the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger, you must hold your shares of Ping Identity common stock
through the Effective Time.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Ping Identity common stock. The
written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a
“proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Ping Identity common
stock is called a “proxy card.”
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone
process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain
from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
13 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted
on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal,
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In that
case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.
If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the
Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid
reply envelope. You may also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the Special Meeting. Even if
you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged to submit your vote by proxy as early as
possible to ensure that your shares will be represented. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using
one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Special Meeting - Voting
Procedures.”
If you are a holder of record of shares of Ping Identity common stock and you submit a proxy card or voting
instructions but do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of
each of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if my shares of Ping Identity common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or
other nominee?
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner”
of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been
forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to
be the stockholder of record.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in “street name,” you must follow
the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or
other nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing
the voting instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement.
Without providing those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal
or the Adjournment Proposal.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or
fail to give voting instructions to your broker, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions, failures to vote and failures to give
voting instructions to your broker will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?
Yes. If you are a stockholder with shares of Ping Identity common stock registered in your name, you may
revoke your proxy at any time prior to the time it is voted by:
filing with our Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;
properly casting a new vote via the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the
Internet or telephone voting facilities described under “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures”;
14 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
duly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Secretary; or
attending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the meeting (although
attendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices at
Ping Identity Holding Corp., 1001 17th Street, Suite 100, Denver, Colorado 80202, Attention: Chief Legal
Officer and Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting. If you want to revoke your proxy
by sending a new proxy card or an instrument revoking the proxy to the Company, you should ensure that
you send your new proxy card or instrument revoking the proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by the
Company prior to the Special Meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in “street name,” you must
contact your bank, broker or other nominee to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares
electronically at the Special Meeting.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or
multiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of Ping Identity common
stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each
brokerage account in which you hold shares of Ping Identity common stock. If you are a holder of Ping
Identity common stock of record and your shares of Ping Identity common stock are registered in more than
one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit your proxy and/or voting instructions for
each set of materials that you receive to ensure that all your shares of Ping Identity common stock are voted.
If I hold my shares of Ping Identity common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
No. Promptly after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing shares of Ping Identity
common stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be sent a
letter of transmittal describing the procedure for surrendering his, her, its or their shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. If you hold your shares in certificated form, you will receive your cash payment after
the payment agent receives your stock certificates and any other documents requested in the instructions.
You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your
stock certificates to the payment agent without a letter of transmittal. If you hold shares of Ping Identity
common stock in uncertificated, book-entry form, you will not be required to deliver a stock certificate, and
you will receive your cash payment after the payment agent receives an “agent’s message” and any other
documents requested in the instructions.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
If available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. We intend
to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special
Meeting. All reports that Ping Identity files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”
Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
If the Merger is completed, holders of Ping Identity common stock who continuously hold shares of Ping
Identity common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands, and who
otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares of Ping Identity common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Ping Identity common stock are entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
15 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
their shares of Ping Identity common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair
value, if any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference
between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Holders of Ping Identity common stock
who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel
with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The
requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail
in this proxy statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is accessible without
subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the
section of this proxy statement titled “Appraisal Rights.”
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
We are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect to complete the
Merger in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be
accurately predicted, because the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, waiver) of the conditions to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company’s respective obligations to
consummate the Merger, some of which are not within the parties’ control.
What effect will the Merger have on Ping Identity?
If the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ping Identity, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease, and Ping Identity will continue to exist following the Merger
as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Following completion of the Merger, shares of Ping Identity
common stock will be delisted from the NYSE, and the registration of shares of Ping Identity common stock
under the Exchange Act will be terminated.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, the holders of Ping Identity common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Ping
Identity common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent
public company and stockholders will continue to own their shares of Ping Identity common stock. The Ping
Identity common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the
NYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Ping Identity may be obligated to pay to
Parent a termination fee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger Agreement - Termination Fees and Expenses.”
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides
advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a
separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. If your shares are held in “street name,” you will receive your
proxy card or other voting information from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will return your
proxy card(s) to your bank, broker or other nominee. You should vote on and sign each proxy card you
receive as discussed above. To request that only one copy of any of these materials be mailed to your
household, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee.

This proxy statement, and any documents to which Ping Identity refers to in this proxy statement, contains
“forward-looking statements”, which include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current

cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,”
“should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “aim,”
“potential,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “goal,” “can,” “seek,” “target” or the negative of these terms or other
similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking
statements are based on management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently
available to, the Company. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks
and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as
statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These
statements are only predictions. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its
then-current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends as well as the beliefs and
assumptions of management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company’s control. Because such
statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of
fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected and are subject to a number of known and
unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:
the risk that the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect
the Company’s business and the price of Ping Identity common stock;
the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the receipt
of certain regulatory approvals (or the imposition of any conditions, limitations or restrictions on
such approvals);
the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger;
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the
termination of the Merger Agreement, including in circumstances requiring the Company to pay a
termination fee of $78 million;
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on the Company’s business relationships,
operating results and business generally;
risks that the Merger disrupts the Company’s current plans and operations;
the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with key business
partners and customers, and others with whom it does business, in light of the Merger;
the response of Ping Identity’s competitors to the Merger;
risks related to diverting management’s attention from the Company’s ongoing business operations;

Recommendation of the Ping Identity Board

The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Ping Identity
common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or 43,140,974 shares of Ping Identity common stock, is
necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum shall fail to attend the Special
Meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Ping
Identity common stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to
another time and/or place. The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine
whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum.
If a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or
other nominee does not provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then,
under applicable rules, the organization that holds its shares may generally vote on “discretionary” matters
but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers
but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers
and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules
provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have
discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner of relevant shares. Ping Identity does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with
discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to
be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to
vote your shares of Ping Identity common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions.
Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of Ping Identity
common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the
adjournment or postponement of the meeting to another date or time.",32,32
Ping Identity Holding Corp._20220916_DEFM14A_20342713_4518798.Pdf,Vote Required,"Vote Required
Adoption of the Merger Proposal
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the
outstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record
date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s
failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal is a condition to the
consummation of the Merger.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding
basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Ping Identity common stock present, in person
or represented by proxy. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether

As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, at the Special Meeting holders of Ping Identity common
stock will consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (referred to as the “Merger
Proposal”). The Merger cannot be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of
Ping Identity stockholders. You are urged to carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed
information concerning the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the information set forth under the
sections of this proxy statement titled “The Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement
carefully and in its entirety.
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock as of the close of business on the record date.
Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s
failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act thereunder, Ping Identity is required to submit a
proposal to our stockholders to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the “golden parachute”
compensation payments that will or may be made by Ping Identity to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. This proposal, commonly known as a “say on golden parachute” proposal,
gives stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory, non-binding basis on the “golden parachute”
compensation payments that will or may be paid by Ping Identity to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger (referred to as the “Compensation Proposal”).
The “golden parachute” compensation that Ping Identity’s named executive officers may be entitled to
receive from Ping Identity in connection with the Merger is summarized in the table that appears in the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Payments and Benefits.” Such summary, in table form, includes the
compensation and benefits that may or will be paid by Ping Identity to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.
The Ping Identity Board encourages you to review carefully the “golden parachute” compensation
information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Ping Identity Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Ping Identity approve the
following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will
or may become payable by Ping Identity to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Quantification of Payments and Benefits table and
the related narrative disclosures.”
The approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Ping
Identity common stock present, in person or represented by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will
not count as votes cast on the Compensation Proposal. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the
Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to
provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will
have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal.
Since the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Parent or Ping
Identity. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is consummated, the compensation
payments that are contractually required to be paid by Ping Identity to its named executive officers will or
may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory
(non-binding) vote of the holders of Ping Identity common stock.
The Ping Identity Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the advisory, 
non-binding Compensation Proposal.

Ping Identity is asking stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Ping Identity Board
to vote in favor of any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, as determined by the
Company, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the
time of the Special Meeting.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Ping
Identity common stock present, in person or represented by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes (if
any) will not count as votes cast on the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, shares deemed not in

same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger
Agreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board,
the Transaction Committee or the representatives of the Company and other parties.
The Board and the Company’s senior management periodically review the Company’s long-term strategy and
objectives in light of market and industry conditions. These reviews have included, among other things,
consideration of organic growth initiatives, acquisitions, divestitures, and potential business combination
transactions, as well as other strategic opportunities, in each case, with a view towards enhancing
stockholder value.
On October 7, 2021, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Andre Durand, Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, on an unsolicited basis, to discuss the industry generally. No proposal was made with respect to
any acquisition or other transaction between Thoma Bravo and the Company during the conversation.
Throughout the remaining pendency of negotiations with Thoma Bravo until the entry into the merger
agreement on August 2, 2022, communications between the Company and Thoma Bravo at times included
discussions with Orlando Bravo or Seth Boro, senior representatives of Thoma Bravo.
On November 12, 2021, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand regarding Thoma Bravo’s
potential interest in an acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr.
Durand that Thoma Bravo intended to submit a non-binding indication of interest with respect to a potential
acquisition of the Company, but did not propose any specific terms at that time. Mr. Durand did not respond
substantively to representatives of Thoma Bravo but stated that he would inform the Board of Thoma
Bravo’s potential interest at the next Board meeting.
On November 16, 2021, Mr. Durand informed members of the Board of Thoma Bravo’s outreach on November
12, 2021.
On November 18, 2021, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), the Company’s outside legal advisor, in attendance. At
the meeting, Mr. Durand informed the Board of the recent inquiry from Thoma Bravo regarding interest in a
potential transaction involving the Company. The Board discussed the importance of execution on fourth
quarter 2022 business objectives to the Company’s long-term prospects and the upcoming investor day
scheduled for December 1, 2021. After discussion, the Board directed Mr. Durand to inform Thoma Bravo
that while the Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that create value for the Company’s
stockholders, the Company was focused on executing its plan for the remainder of the fourth quarter and its
upcoming investor day, and not interested in pursuing a strategic transaction at that time. At the meeting,
representatives of Kirkland also reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in
the context of receipt of an unsolicited acquisition proposal, and discussed certain considerations for the
Board when responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. In addition, the Board directed
31 TABLE OF CONTENTS
management to prepare various financial scenarios applying different hypothetical assumptions related to
growth rates to the strategic plan which had been previously prepared by management in the ordinary
course, a portion of which hand been presented to the Board on November 2, 2021 in anticipation of its the
Company’s investor day planned for December 1, 2021 (such portion being referred to herein as the
“November Strategic Plan”).
Later on November 18, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted an unsolicited non-binding indication of interest to the
Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $35.00 per share (the
“November Proposal”), representing a 29% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $27.16 as of
November 18, 2021. The November Proposal also contemplated a “go-shop” provision that would enable the
Company to solicit alternative bids for 30 days after signing.
Later that evening on November 18, 2021, the November Proposal was distributed to the Board for review.
On November 19, 2021, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand reiterating Thoma
Bravo’s interest in acquiring the Company.
Also on November 19, 2021, Mr. Durand and Michael Fosnaugh, chairman of the Board, discussed the
November Proposal, and Mr. Fosnaugh directed Mr. Durand to deliver the message directed by the Board to
representatives of Thoma Bravo.
On November 20, 2021, as directed by the Board, Mr. Durand responded to the senior representative of
Thoma Bravo and informed him that while the Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that create
value for the Company’s stockholders, the Board was not contemplating pursuing a sale transaction at that
time in light of the Company’s focus on executing its fourth quarter plan and its upcoming investor day.
On December 1, 2021, the Company hosted its investor day.
On December 10, 2021, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Durand updated the Board on the recent
communications with Thoma Bravo in which he had delivered the message previously directed by the Board,
as described above. After discussion, the Board determined that it was still of the view that management
should focus on executing its plan for the fourth quarter and not on pursuing a potential strategic
transaction. Also at the meeting, the Company’s management presented the various hypothetical financial
scenarios that applied different growth rate assumptions developed by management to the November
Strategic Plan. Following discussion, the Board instructed the Company’s management to further refine such
hypothetical scenarios. At the meeting, the Board also determined not to engage in discussions with any
financial advisors at that time in order to minimize the risk of potential leaks and disruption to the business.
On January 4, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and requested a meeting
following the completion of the fourth quarter. Mr. Durand agreed to have a phone call with representatives
of Thoma Bravo on January 18, 2022.
On January 12, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Fosnaugh and reiterated Thoma
Bravo’s interest in a potential transaction with the Company. Mr. Fosnaugh reiterated the Board’s position
that the Company was focused on executing its standalone plan and not on pursuing a potential transaction
at that time.
On January 18, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo and Mr. Durand had a phone conversation during
which the representatives of Thoma Bravo reiterated Thoma Bravo’s interest in a potential transaction with
the Company. Mr. Durand did not respond substantively to the representatives of Thoma Bravo but
indicated that he would relay Thoma Bravo’s interest to the Board.
On January 19, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Durand updated the Board on his recent
conversation with representatives of Thoma Bravo. Also at the meeting, the Company’s management
presented various revised hypothetical financial scenarios that applied different growth rate assumptions
developed by management to the Company’s November Strategic Plan. The Board asked questions related to
the assumptions that had been used in preparing the hypothetical financial scenarios. Following discussion,

light of (i) the time that had passed following the submission of the November Proposal, (ii) the broader
decline in stock prices in the general market and in the identity and access management industry and in the
cybersecurity industry more broadly, and (iii) the approximately 30% decline in the Company’s stock price
during such time, the Board instructed Mr. Durand to inform Thoma Bravo that, while the Company remained
focused on executing its standalone plan and was not contemplating a potential sale transaction, if Thoma
Bravo remained interested in a transaction, they should submit an updated written proposal to the Board
which confirmed the price per share at which Thoma Bravo would be willing to acquire all of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock.
On January 24, 2022, Mr. Durand informed Thoma Bravo that, while the Company remained focused on
executing its standalone plan and was not contemplating a potential sale transaction, but indicated that if
Thoma Bravo remained interested in a transaction, then it should resubmit an indication of interest that
included Thoma Bravo’s current proposed value for a potential transaction.
On January 31, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest
to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $26.00 per share (the “January
Proposal”), representing a 38% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $18.90 as of January 28,
2022. The January Proposal also contemplated a “go-shop” provision that would enable the Company to
solicit alternative bids for 30 days after signing.
On February 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Kirkland in attendance. The Board discussed the terms of Thoma Bravo’s January
Proposal, and, following discussion, determined (i) to reject Thoma Bravo’s proposal in light of the proposed
terms, and (ii) to inform Thoma Bravo that the Board did not find the proposal attractive and was focused on
executing its current business plan, but that the Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that created
value for all stockholders and there was sufficient public information available for Thoma Bravo to develop
its views with respect to any potential transaction. The Board instructed Mr. Durand to convey that message
to Thoma Bravo.
On February 8, 2022, Mr. Durand delivered the message directed by the Board to representatives of Thoma
Bravo.
On February 10, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Fosnaugh to reiterate Thoma
Bravo’s interest in a potential transaction with the Company. Mr. Fosnaugh reiterated the Board’s position
that it was not interested in a transaction on the terms set forth in the January Proposal.
Also on February 10, 2022, a representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand to reiterate Thoma
Bravo’s interest in a potential transaction with the Company.
On February 11, 2022, Mr. Durand responded to the representative of Thoma Bravo and reiterated the same
Board-directed message that he had delivered on February 8, 2022.
Later on February 11, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding
indication of interest to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $30.00 per
share (the “February Proposal”), representing a 49% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $20.10
as of February 11, 2022. The February Proposal also contemplated a “go-shop” provision that would enable
the Company to solicit alternative bids for 30 days after signing.
On February 12, 2022, the February Proposal was distributed to the Board for review.
On February 23, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Kirkland in attendance. Mr. Durand updated the Board with respect to communications
with Thoma Bravo. The Board also discussed the Company’s future prospects and noted its continued
support of pursuing the Company’s standalone plan. After discussion, the Board determined that the
February Proposal was insufficient for the Company to engage in further discussions about a potential
strategic transaction at the time and instructed management to convey the same to Thoma Bravo. After the
Board meeting, Mr. Durand conveyed the message to representatives of Thoma Bravo by telephone that
same day.
On April 19, 2022, representatives of a private equity firm, which we refer to herein as Party A, were, at the
request of Party A, introduced by representatives of Goldman Sachs to Messrs. Durand and Dani via email.

On April 21, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and expressed a continued
interest in exploring an acquisition of the Company and a continued interest in the industry.
Between the submission of Thoma Bravo’s February Proposal and contact from the senior representative of
Thoma Bravo on April 21, 2022, market valuations declined precipitously, including for cybersecurity
software companies, interest rates increased significantly, and the market was impacted by growing
inflationary pressures, including as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
On May 2, 2022, Messrs. Durand and Dani had an in-person meeting with representatives of Party A, during
which representatives of Party A outlined their thesis on the cybersecurity industry generally. The
representatives of Party A did not make any proposal with respect to a transaction with the Company at this
meeting.
On May 10, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo (including a senior representative of Thoma Bravo) had
dinner with Mr. Durand. No proposal was made with respect to a potential transaction during the dinner, but
the senior Representative of Thoma Bravo noted that Thoma Bravo continued to be interested in a potential
transaction with the Company.
On May 15, 2022, Mr. Durand met virtually with representatives of Thoma Bravo, during which the
representatives of Thoma Bravo reiterated Thoma Bravo’s continued interest in exploring an acquisition of
the Company and a continued interest in the industry.
On May 21, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and indicated that Thoma
Bravo intended to submit a revised written proposal to acquire all of the common stock of the Company.
On May 24, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding indication of
interest to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $27.00 per share (the “May
Proposal”), representing a 48% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $18.24 as of May 24, 2022.
The May Proposal also contemplated a “go-shop” provision that would enable the Company to solicit
alternative bids for 30 days after signing.
On May 27, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives
of Kirkland and Goldman Sachs, the Company’s financial advisor, which had been invited to the meeting at
the request of the Board due to Goldman Sachs’ longstanding relationship and familiarity with the Company,
reputation as a highly regarded investment bank, substantial knowledge of the industry in which the
Company operates and extensive experience in providing financial advice in connection with strategic
transactions, in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Board its fiduciary
duties under Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when undertaking an
evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. Also at the meeting, Mr.
Durand updated the Board on the conversations held between Mr. Durand and representatives of Thoma
Bravo to date and the Board discussed the terms of Thoma Bravo’s May Proposal. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs presented an overview of the current state of the markets, including current market valuation
for cybersecurity software companies, heightened market volatility, rising interest rates, constraints around
availability of financing and growing inflationary pressures. The Board also discussed market conditions
generally, including a potential recession and possible macroeconomic challenges facing the Company,
including challenges relating to the Company’s cloud transformation. As a result of such change in market
conditions, the Board instructed the Company’s management to prepare financial projections that were
updated to reflect the passage of time and the Board’s current outlook on the business (including lower
projected growth rates) and extrapolate beyond the projections historically prepared by management in the
ordinary course to include additional years, for use by the Board in evaluating any acquisition proposals and
to provide the updated long-range projections to Goldman Sachs for its review and preliminary use. The
Board determined to reconvene the following week to review the updated long-range projections and have a
preliminary discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs of their financial implications.
Following the Board meeting, on May 30, 2022, Mr. Durand conveyed to representatives of Thoma Bravo
that the Board needed additional time to consider their May Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 2, 2022, Messrs. Durand and Dani held an introductory in-person meeting with representatives of a
private equity firm, which we refer to herein as Party B, who had requested a meeting with the Company,
during which Party B expressed its interest in a potential transaction with the Company, and its interest in
the identity and cybersecurity industry generally. Messrs. Durand and Dani, and representatives of Party B
did not discuss any terms of a potential transaction.
On June 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives
of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. The Board reviewed the updated long-range financial
projections that had been prepared by the Company’s management at the direction of the Board at its May
27, 2022 meeting (the “June Projections”). Following discussion, the Board approved those projections for
use by Goldman Sachs in its financial analysis (for additional information with respect to just financial
projections, see the section of this proxy statement titled “- Certain Financial Projections”).
Representatives of Goldman Sachs led a discussion with respect to the long-range projections that had been
prepared by management and the financial implications thereof in light of ongoing market volatility and
challenges facing the industry in which the Company operates. The Board and members of management in
attendance also discussed with representatives of Goldman Sachs potential alternatives to a sale of the
Company, including continuing to execute the Company’s standalone plan. At the meeting, the Board
considered and discussed whether the timing was appropriate for a potential sale transaction, including the
relative risks and benefits thereof, with the Board focusing on, among other things, the probability of
consummating a successful sale at compelling value and the ability of the Company to execute on its
standalone plan given challenges facing the industry. After consultation with representatives of Goldman
Sachs, the Board instructed Company management to inform Thoma Bravo that Thoma Bravo’s proposed
valuation was insufficient, but that the Board would be willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with
Thoma Bravo to share certain financial due diligence information in order to enable Thoma Bravo to increase
its valuation. The Board also instructed the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs
to conduct outreach to Party A and Party B, who were selected for outreach as the parties most likely to be
interested in exploring a transaction with the Company based on their perceived interest in making
investments in the industry in which the Company operates, the fact that they had previously expressed an
interest in acquiring the Company and their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size. In
addition, after reviewing and discussing the June Projections, the Board approved disclosure of the June
Projections to bidders following the execution of an acceptable confidentiality agreement.
On June 4, 2022, Mr. Durand conveyed the Board-directed message to representatives of Thoma Bravo.
On June 5, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives
of Party A and Party B, who had both previously expressed interest in participating in any process in which
the Company explored strategic alternatives, to offer them the opportunity to enter into a confidentiality
agreement and receive certain due diligence information if they were still interested in a potential transaction.
Party A and Party B both indicated that they were interested in acquiring the Company and requested a copy
of the confidentiality agreement. Representatives of Party A also informed representatives of Goldman Sachs
that they would want to partner with two other financial sponsors (referred to herein as “Party C” and “Party
D”, respectively, and collectively with Party A, the “Consortium”). Representatives of Goldman Sachs
informed Party A that they would discuss this request with the Company.
On June 7, 2022, while attending an industry conference, Mr. Durand met with a representative of Thoma
Bravo and discussed the Company and the industry generally. Mr. Durand and the representative of Thoma
Bravo did not discuss any terms of a potential transaction.
On June 8, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo. The
confidentiality agreement included customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill
provision that prohibited Thoma Bravo (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to
acquire or acquiring the Company, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, in each
case without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Thoma Bravo to
make acquisition proposals at any time after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third
party providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. Following execution of the
confidentiality agreement, Thoma Bravo was provided access to select financial due diligence information,
including the June Projections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 9, 2022, after discussions with management of the Company, representatives of Goldman Sachs
informed Party A that the Company would prefer to engage with Party A on a standalone basis and would
consider requests to partner with other financial sponsors later in the process. Party A informed
representatives of Goldman Sachs that it would need time to consider this request.
On June 10, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party B. The confidentiality
agreement included customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that
prohibited Party B (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the
Company, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, in each case without the prior
consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Party B to make acquisition proposals at
any time after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third party providing for a change of
control transaction of the Company. Following execution of the confidentiality agreement, Party B was
provided with access to select financial due diligence information, including the June Projections.
On June 12, 2022, the Company’s management provided an update to the Board regarding the status of a
potential transaction involving the Company, including that confidentiality agreements had been executed
with Thoma Bravo and with Party B. The Company management’s update also provided that each of Party A
and Party B had expressed interest in acquiring the Company.
On June 23, 2022, Mr. Durand received a non-binding unsolicited indication of interest from the Consortium
to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for between $24.00 and $25.00 per share (the
“Consortium Proposal”).
On June 24, 2022, the Company’s management gave a presentation to representatives of Thoma Bravo
regarding the Company, with representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance.
Later on June 24, 2022, the Company’s management provided an update to the Board regarding the status of
the potential transaction involving the Company, including providing a copy of the Consortium Proposal to
the Board. After reviewing the Consortium Proposal and in light of the fact that Party A had already engaged
in discussions with Party C and Party D, and the Board believed that Party A would be the lead investor of
the Consortium, the Board permitted Party A to partner with Parties C and D in connection with a potential
transaction and to consider the Consortium Proposal as a joint bid.
On June 28, 2022, at the request of Thoma Bravo, management gave an additional presentation to
representatives of Thoma Bravo to answer supplemental diligence questions, with representatives of
Goldman Sachs in attendance.
On June 30, 2022, the Company’s management gave a presentation to representatives of Party B regarding
the Company, with representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance.
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s management updated the Board on the status of the current process.
On July 1, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A. The confidentiality
agreement included customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that (among
other things) prohibited Party A (for an agreed-upon period) from offering to acquire or acquiring the
Company, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, in each case without the prior
consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Party A to make acquisition proposals at
any time after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third party providing for a change of
control transaction of the Company.
Also on July 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs sent a process letter to Party A and Party B
instructing them to submit indications of interest by 12:00 p.m. Pacific Time on July 14, 2022.
On July 5, 2022, each of Parties C and D executed a joinder to the Company’s confidentiality agreement with
Party A. Following the execution of joinders by Party C and Party D, Goldman Sachs provided the
Consortium with access to select financial due diligence information, including the June Projections.
On July 5, 2022, the Company’s management gave a presentation to representatives of the Consortium
regarding the Company, with representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 6, 2022, the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs had follow-up financial
due diligence sessions with each of Party B and the Consortium.
On July 8, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives
of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, a representative of Kirkland reviewed with the
Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when
evaluating a potential sale of the Company. Management also updated the Board with respect to the
diligence sessions that had been conducted to date and a discussion ensued regarding the terms of the May
Proposal, as well as the Consortium Proposal. At the meeting, the Board instructed representatives of
Goldman Sachs to inform each of Thoma Bravo and the Consortium that they would need to meaningfully
increase their prices.
After the Board meeting on July 8, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs
informed representatives of Thoma Bravo that they would need to meaningfully increase their price in order
for the Board to agree to engage with Thoma Bravo with respect to a transaction.
On July 9, 2022, Messrs. Durand and Dani and representatives of Goldman Sachs met with representatives of
Thoma Bravo to discuss and respond to additional financial due diligence questions.
Also on July 9, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Party A with selected supplemental financial due
diligence materials in response to diligence questions asked by Party A.
On July 11, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding indication of
interest to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $28.50 per share,
representing a 44% premium to the Company’s closing share price of $19.81 as of July 11, 2022, and replaced
the “go-shop” provision previously proposed by Thoma Bravo with a “no-shop” provision (the “July 11
Proposal”).
On July 12, 2022, the Company’s management updated the Board on the status of the current process,
including receipt of the July 11 Proposal.
Later on July 12, 2022, Party B informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was no longer interested in
pursuing an acquisition of the Company, and the Consortium also indicated to representatives of Goldman
Sachs that it would only be interested in pursuing a transaction at a price below its previous offer, which it
understood was below what the Board would be interested in pursuing, and so would not be submitting a
revised proposal. As reasons for their decisions, each of Party B and the Consortium cited the trajectory and
timing of the Company’s revenue transition and path to higher margins being longer than it had anticipated.
On July 15, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives
of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. The Board discussed the status of the potential transaction,
including the terms of Thoma Bravo’s July 11 Proposal, as well as related process considerations. At the
meeting, the Board discussed with its advisors potential strategic alternatives for the Company, including
the possibility of soliciting interest from other potential bidders. Members of management shared with the
Board their views on the challenges facing the Company, including certain macro-economic headwinds and
completing the cloud transformation in the current environment, and representatives of Goldman Sachs
discussed the potential buyer universe, both as to financial sponsors and strategic companies. The Board
further discussed the fact that each of Thoma Bravo, Party B and the Consortium were highly credible
bidders and had expressed interest in the Company, as well as the risks of losing Thoma Bravo as the current
bidder if the Company took additional time to pursue any potential new bidders. Following discussion, the
Board determined that, in light of discussions to date with Thoma Bravo, Party B and the Consortium, who
were perceived as the most likely potential acquirers of the Company, together with the risks to the Company
associated with leaks and a potential failed process, it would not conduct outreach to other potential bidders
at this time. The Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company’s stockholders to continue
engagement with Thoma Bravo, and instructed the Company’s management and advisors to continue such
engagement. Further, at the meeting, the Board determined that it was prepared to agree to include a “no-
shop” provision in the definitive transaction documents in light of the prior outreach to the parties who were
believed to be the most likely acquirers of the Company, but would only be willing to proceed on that basis if
Thoma Bravo agreed (1) to provide a full
37 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
equity backstop for the full purchase price to increase closing certainty for the Company, (2) that the
termination fee payable by the Company in the event the definitive agreement is terminated to enable the
Company to enter into an alternative transaction would be less than 3% of equity value, and (3) to move
expeditiously to sign before or concurrently with the Company’s earnings announcement on August 2, 2022.
The Board also instructed Goldman Sachs to encourage Thoma Bravo to increase their price, and to ask
Thoma Bravo for a price of $30.00 per share, In addition, the Board resolved to form an ad-hoc transaction
committee (the “Transaction Committee”) for convenience and efficiency, and not to address any potential
conflicts of interest, and Michael Fosnaugh, Yancey L. Spruill and John McCormack, all of whom had
significant experience with mergers and acquisition transactions, were appointed to the Transaction
Committee. The Board authorized the Transaction Committee to assist management with respect to
negotiating a possible transaction with Thoma Bravo and to provide timely Board input on issues as they
arose; provided that any potential transaction involving the Company would need to be approved by the full
Board.
Later on July 15, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs had a phone call with
representatives of Thoma Bravo and conveyed to Thoma Bravo that they should increase their price to
$30.00 per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also informed Thoma Bravo that, subject to an
agreement on an increased price, the Board was prepared to agree to include a “no-shop” provision in the
definitive transaction documents, but would only be willing to proceed on that basis if Thoma Bravo agreed
(1) to provide a full equity backstop for the full purchase price to increase closing certainty for the Company,
(2) that the termination fee payable by the Company in the event the definitive agreement is terminated to
enable the Company to enter into an alternative transaction would be no higher than 2.9% of equity value
and (3) that the parties would agree to sign before or concurrently with the Company’s earnings
announcement on August 2, 2022.
On July 16, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and agreed to
(i) increase their price to $28.75, noting that it was their “best and final” price (representing a 61% premium to
the Company’s closing share price of $17.86 as of July 15, 2022), (ii) provide a full equity backstop, (iii) a
termination fee of 2.9% of equity value, but with additional expense reimbursement, and (iv) move
expeditiously to sign by August 2, 2022 (assuming diligence materials were provided). Representatives of
Thoma Bravo also requested exclusivity on these terms. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Thoma
Bravo that they did not believe the Board would be willing to entertain exclusivity.
Later on July 16, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with members of the Company’s
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs updated the Transaction Committee on their discussions with Thoma Bravo. Following discussion, the
Transaction Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Thoma Bravo that the Company was prepared to
move forward on the basis outlined by Thoma Bravo, but that the Company would not agree to exclusivity
and that any expense reimbursement payable to Thoma Bravo would be capped at $1,500,000.
On July 16, 2022, after the Transaction Committee meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted
representatives of Thoma Bravo to inform them that the Board was prepared to move forward on the terms
previously discussed, subject to agreement that expense reimbursement would be capped at $1,500,000.
Thoma Bravo confirmed that they agreed with these terms and informed Goldman Sachs they would send a
revised offer letter reflecting the agreed upon terms.
Later on July 16, 2022, the Company’s management updated the Board about the status of discussions
between representatives of Goldman Sachs and Thoma Bravo earlier that day.
On July 17, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding offer letter to the
Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $28.75 per share, representing a 61%
premium to the Company’s closing share price of $17.86 as of July 15, 2022, and which letter also contained
the other terms that had been agreed by the parties.
On July 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo was provided with access to a virtual data room with diligence information
regarding the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 21, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft Merger Agreement that had been prepared
by Kirkland to representatives of Goodwin Procter LLP (“Goodwin”), outside counsel to Thoma Bravo. The
initial draft Merger Agreement provided for a “hell-or-high-water” regulatory efforts covenant and reflected
the other terms that had been previously agreed by the parties.
Also on July 21, 2022, Goldman Sachs submitted a relationship disclosure letter to the Board.
On July 22, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives
of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. The Board discussed the status of the potential transaction,
including (among other things) the terms of Thoma Bravo’s final offer letter, dated July 17, 2022. A
representative of Kirkland provided a summary to the Board of the initial draft Merger Agreement provided
to Thoma Bravo. At the meeting, the Board reviewed Goldman Sachs’ relationship disclosure letter, and
determined that no such conflicts would affect the ability of Goldman Sachs to fulfill its responsibilities as
financial advisor to the Company.
On July 23, 2022, the Company and Goldman Sachs executed an engagement letter.
On July 25, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to
representatives of Kirkland, and between July 26, 2022 and August 2, 2022, representatives of Kirkland and
Goodwin, on behalf of the Company and Thoma Bravo, respectively, exchanged drafts of the Merger
Agreement and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the draft Merger Agreement. Among other
items in the draft Merger Agreement, the parties negotiated (i) the efforts required by the Company and
Thoma Bravo to obtain the required regulatory approvals, including restrictions on Thoma Bravo from
entering into transactions that would reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a
cap on Thoma Bravo’s liability for damages from breaches of the Merger Agreement, (iii) the treatment of
outstanding Company equity awards and covenants regarding employee benefit matters applicable to
Company employees generally, (iv) the Company’s representations, warranties and interim operating
covenants, and (v) Thoma Bravo’s request that Vista Equity Partners LLC, holder of approximately 9.7% of
the Company’s shares of common stock, enter into a voting and support agreement to vote its shares in
favor of the Merger.
Also on July 25, 2022, a representative of Thoma Bravo had a telephone conversation with Mr. Durand
during which the representative of Thoma Bravo confirmed that no red flags had been discovered in
diligence and that everything remained on track to sign a definitive Merger Agreement on August 2, 2022
and announce the transaction before the opening of the U.S. stock markets on August 3, 2022.
On July 27, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent to representatives of Kirkland initial drafts of each of the
Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty to be entered into by the applicable Thoma Bravo fund
concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement. Also on July 27, 2022, representatives of Kirkland
sent an initial draft of the Company disclosure letter to representatives of Goodwin.
On July 28, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft of the Voting Agreement and a revised draft
of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Goodwin, and between July 28 and August 2, 2022,
representatives of Kirkland and Goodwin and members of the Company’s management engaged in numerous
calls and exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, Limited Guaranty,
Voting Agreement, Company disclosure letter and other transaction documents.
On July 29, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and representatives
of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Members of management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Kirkland updated the Board with respect to due diligence workstreams and the status of the
transaction.
On July 30, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and representatives of Goldman
Sachs to discuss the antitrust efforts covenant included in the draft of the Merger Agreement sent by
Kirkland on July 25, 2022, noting that it was important to Thoma Bravo to have flexibility to enter into other
acquisitions and they were unwilling to agree to be restricted from such activity between signing and
closing. Representatives of Thoma Bravo also mentioned that the financing markets were more difficult than
anticipated and were putting pressure on Thoma Bravo’s valuation of the Company, but did not propose any
specific changes to the terms of the deal at that time.
39 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 31, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and informed him that, as a
result of difficult and worsening conditions in the financing market, Thoma Bravo was no longer willing to
proceed at the previously agreed price of $28.75 per share and was reducing its offer to $26.75 per share. Mr.
Durand responded that he would convey the reduced offer price to the Board, but did not believe there
would be interest in pursuing a transaction on these revised terms.
Following that call, on July 31, 2022, Mr. Durand discussed the revised proposal from Thoma Bravo with the
Transaction Committee, and the Transaction Committee instructed Mr. Durand to convey to the senior
representative of Thoma Bravo that the Company was not interested in pursuing a transaction on those
terms.
Also on July 31, 2022, as a result of Thoma Bravo’s reduction in valuation, the Company instructed its
advisors not to engage with Thoma Bravo’s representatives or advisors.
Later on July 31, 2022, Mr. Durand and a senior representative of Thoma Bravo had a subsequent
conversation during which Mr. Durand informed the senior representative of Thoma Bravo that the Company
was not interested in pursuing a transaction at $26.75. The senior representative of Thoma Bravo then
reiterated that Thoma Bravo had encountered difficulties in the financing market and that, although they
remained interested in the Company, would no longer be able to move forward at the previously agreed price,
but that they would be open to meeting in the middle between Thoma Bravo’s revised offer of $26.75 and the
previously agreed upon price of $28.75, and suggested a $1 reduction in purchase price as a possible
solution. Mr. Durand stated that he would convey the message to the Board.
On August 1, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of the Company’s management
and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and
members of the Company’s management updated the Transaction Committee on conversations with
representatives of Thoma Bravo. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee instructed Goldman
Sachs to inform Thoma Bravo that the Company was not interested in a transaction at a price below the
previously agreed price of $28.75.
On August 1, 2022, following the Transaction Committee meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs
contacted Thoma Bravo and informed them that the Transaction Committee was unwilling to agree to a
reduction in price. Thoma Bravo reiterated that due to difficulties in the financing market, they were unable
to proceed at the previously agreed price, and noted that they would only move forward if there was some
movement to a price below $28.75.
Later on August 1, 2022, the Transaction Committee held another meeting, with members of the Company’s
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs updated the Transaction Committee on their conversations with Thoma Bravo with respect to
valuation. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Thoma
Bravo that the Company would be willing to agree to a price of $28.50 per share but only if certain remaining
open provisions in the Merger Agreement are resolved in favor of the Company’s position, including those
related to the efforts Thoma Bravo was required to take to obtain regulatory approvals and a commitment
from Thoma Bravo not to enter into transactions that would reasonably be expected to delay consummation
of the Merger. The Transaction Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Thoma Bravo that the
Company would not be interested in any transaction below this price, and that if Thoma Bravo was not
prepared to move forward to sign an agreement on that basis the Company would move forward on a
standalone basis, and continue to execute on its current plan.
Following the second Transaction Committee meeting, on August 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs
called representatives of Thoma Bravo to deliver the Transaction Committee’s message. Thoma Bravo
responded by indicating that a $0.25 reduction in purchase price was insufficient, but stated that they would
be willing to proceed at a $0.50 reduction, which equated to a price of $28.25 per share. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs informed representatives of Thoma Bravo that the Transaction Committee was unwilling to
agree to a price below its previous offer of $28.50 per share.
Later on August 1, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo called representatives of Goldman Sachs and
agreed to the price of $28.50 per share, representing a 66% premium to the Company’s closing share price of
$17.17 as of August 1, 2022, and agreed to resolve the open issues largely in the manner proposed by the
40 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company. Following the agreement to proceed on these terms, the Company instructed its advisors to
engage with Thoma Bravo’s advisors to finalize the transaction documents before the Company’s earnings
announcement on the morning of August 3, 2022 and representatives of Goodwin, on behalf of Thoma Bravo,
and Kirkland, on behalf of the Company, engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the
Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, Limited Guaranty, Voting Agreement, Company disclosure
letter and other transaction documents.
Also on August 1, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Members of management and representatives
of Goldman Sachs updated the Board with respect to the revised terms proposed by Thoma Bravo and the
negotiations that had occurred over the weekend and a discussion ensued. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs reviewed their financial analysis with the Board (which were based on the June Projections, but
updated to account for the completion of the second quarter of 2022, as more fully described in the section
of this proxy statement titled “- Certain Financial Projections”), noting that they would be prepared when
requested by the Board to deliver an opinion that, based upon and subject to the various assumptions that
would be set forth therein, the per share consideration of $28.50 in cash to be paid to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders. Representatives of Kirkland discussed with the Board its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the potential transaction, and summarized the terms
of the draft Merger Agreement, including with respect to (i) the efforts Thoma Bravo was required to take to
obtain regulatory approvals and that before receipt of required antitrust approvals Thoma Bravo was
prohibited from entering into transactions that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
receipt of required antitrust approvals for the transaction, (ii) the amount of the termination fee payable by
the Company in certain circumstances, and (iii) the limitation on damages payable by either party under the
Merger Agreement, including the cap on damages payable by Thoma Bravo of 7% of equity value. The Board
discussed the price and other terms of the Merger Agreement, including the importance of the full equity
backstop and antitrust efforts covenants to enhance certainty of closing, and indicated its support for a
transaction on those terms.
On August 2, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered
to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
August 2, 2022, to the effect that, as of August 2, 2022, and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions set forth therein, the per share consideration of $28.50 in cash to be paid to the holders (other
than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to such holders. Goldman Sachs’s opinion is more fully described in the
section of this proxy statement titled “- Opinion of Goldman Sachs.”
On the evening of August 2, 2022, following prior discussion and consideration of the Merger Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the factors described in the
section titled “- Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board”), the members of the Board, by
unanimous action by written consent: (1) determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement; (2) approved the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be
submitted for consideration by the stockholders of the Company at a meeting thereof. Further, the members
of the Board reviewed and approved the Voting Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited
Guaranty, the Company disclosure letter and other transaction documents.
Overnight on August 2, 2022, the Company and Thoma Bravo executed the Merger Agreement and delivered
an executed Voting Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty. After execution of the
transaction agreements, the Company and Thoma Bravo issued a joint press release announcing the entry
into the Merger Agreement before the opening of the U.S. stock exchange on August 3, 2022.

Ping Identity Holding Corp._20220916_DEFM14A_20342713_4518798.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Ping Identity Board,"Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Ping Identity Board
The Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with Ping Identity’s
senior management and legal and financial advisors and, upon the unanimous recommendation of the
Transaction Committee, the Board: (1) determined that it was in the best interests of Ping Identity and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement; (2) approved the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by Ping Identity, the performance by Ping Identity of its covenants and
other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended that the stockholders of Ping Identity adopt the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be
submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Ping Identity at a meeting thereof. Accordingly, the Board
recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
In reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Ping Identity
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board and the Transaction Committee considered the
following positive reasons to support the Merger Agreement:
the fact that the price of $28.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate
value and liquidity to Ping Identity stockholders;
the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Ping Identity
common stock, including the fact that the $28.50 per share to be received by Ping Identity
stockholders in the Merger represents a premium of approximately 63% over the closing price per
share as of August 2, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger, and
approximately 52% over the volume weighted average price per share for the 60 days ending August
2, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger;

international, national and local economic conditions, the current environment in the enterprise
identity security industry, and the likely effect of these factors on Ping Identity and the execution of
Ping Identity’s plans as a standalone public company;
the fact that Ping Identity is undergoing a Software as a Service and platform transformation and is
subject to market challenges and unpredictability in connection with such transition, as well as
increased exposure to variability in GAAP accounting results which could expose investors to
increased volatility in trading prices;
the belief that the $28.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Ping Identity
stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives
reasonably available to Ping Identity, based upon the directors’ extensive knowledge of Ping
Identity’s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, the challenges completing
the cloud transformation in the current macro-economic environment, Ping Identity’s historical and
projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an
attractive and comparatively certain value for Ping Identity stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted
prospects for Ping Identity on a standalone basis;
the belief that the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Ping Identity’s
stockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the Merger (including possible
alternative business combinations and scenarios involving the possibility of remaining a standalone
publicly traded company), and the timing, risks and likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives,
taking into account the Board’s belief that there were likely no other potential strategic purchasers or
other parties that would be reasonably likely to engage in a transaction in the near term at a price
greater than the price being offered by Thoma Bravo;
the process conducted by Ping Identity, with the assistance of its advisors, to review other potential
strategic alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with numerous counterparties
regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of Ping Identity;
the fact that Ping Identity entered into confidentiality agreements with three potential bidders (or
groups of bidders), and that Thoma Bravo was the only party to submit a final offer to acquire Ping
Identity;

the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Ping Identity, in the
aggregate, to which Thoma Bravo would be willing to agree;

opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.50 in cash per

their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the
Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for shares of Ping Identity common stock;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain
other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent
business combinations in the software industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies

Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be
in any way meaningful to its analysis.

the transaction, or the relative merits of the transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be
available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent

per share of Ping Identity common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs does not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of
the Merger Agreement or transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the transaction,

Summary of Material Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Ping
Identity Board in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however,
does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor
does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete

information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before
August 1, 2022 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Premia and Multiple Analysis.
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain premia based on the $28.50 in cash per share of Ping
Identity common stock Merger Consideration to (i) the closing price per share of Ping Identity common stock
as of August 1, 2022, (ii) the volume-weighted average price per share of Ping Identity common stock for the
five trading-day period ending on August 1, 2022, (iii) the volume-weighted average price per share of Ping
Identity common stock for the ten trading-day period ending on August 1, 2022, (iv) the volume-weighted
average price per share of Ping Identity common stock for the 30 trading-day period ending on August 1,
2022, (v) the volume-weighted average price per share of Ping Identity common stock for the 60 trading-day
period ending on August 1, 2022, (vi) the volume-weighted average price per share of Ping Identity common
stock for the six-month period ending on August 1, 2022, (vii) the highest closing price of the shares of Ping
Identity common stock over the 52-week period ended on August 1, 2022 and (viii) the lowest closing price
of the shares of Ping Identity common stock over the 52-week period ended on August 1, 2022.
The results of these calculations are as follows:

Illustrative Discounted Free Cash Flow Analysis.
Using the Financial Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on
the Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Ping Identity common stock. Using
the mid-year convention for cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates
of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present

value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company for the years 2022
through 2036 as reflected in the Financial Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the
Company, which were calculated by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.0% to 3.0%
(which implied an illustrative range of multiples of terminal value to next twelve months, or “NTM,”
unlevered free cash flow (excluding stock-based compensation) to be generated by the Company, as
provided by management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of the
Company, multiples ranging from 6.7x to 9.7x). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of
the Capital Asset Pricing Model (which is referred to in this section as “CAPM”), which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including the Company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term
debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for
the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The
perpetuity growth rate range for the Company was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional
judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, the Financial Projections, and market
expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the range of
present values it derived as described above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative
enterprise values it derived for the Company, the net debt of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and added the
net present value of cash tax savings from net operating loss carryforwards and R&D credit carryforwards,
as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management
of the Company to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then derived
a range of illustrative per share of Ping Identity common stock equity values, based on the number of fully
diluted outstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock as of August 1, 2022, as provided by the
management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company and
calculated using the treasury stock method to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Ping
Identity common stock ranging from $23.59 to $35.77.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis.
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value
per share of Ping Identity common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a
theoretical future value of the Company’s equity as a function of the Company’s estimated future NTM
revenue and assumed one-year forward enterprise value to revenue multiples. For this analysis, Goldman
Sachs used the Financial Projections for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. Goldman Sachs first calculated
the implied enterprise values for the Company as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by
applying enterprise value to NTM revenue multiples, which are referred to in this section as “EV / NTM
Revenue,” of 5.5x to 7.5x to revenue estimates for the Company for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025
based on the Financial Projections. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs
using its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical EV / NTM
Revenue multiples for the Company and certain selected software companies as described in the section
below captioned “- Selected Public Company Comparables”. Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of
the Company’s forecasted net debt for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, respectively, as of the relevant
year-end, each as provided by the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the
Company, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values
for the Company as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then divided the
results by the number of projected year-end fully diluted outstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock
for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, respectively, as provided by the management of the Company, and
approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company to derive a range of implied future
share of Ping Identity common stock prices. Goldman Sachs then discounted the December 31, 2022 to
December 31, 2024 implied future share of Ping Identity common stock price values as of August 1, 2022
using an illustrative discount rate of 12.9%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s standalone cost of
equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United
States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of
Ping Identity common stock of $22.49 to $39.37 per share of Ping Identity common stock.

Selected Transactions Analysis.
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions
in the software industry since 2016. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and
compared the implied EV / NTM Revenue of the applicable target company based on the enterprise value of
the target company as a multiple of the target company’s NTM revenue at the time each such selected
transaction was announced based on FactSet and Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (“IBES”) estimates.
While none of the selected transactions or companies that participated in the selected transactions are
directly comparable to the transaction or the Company, the companies that participated in the selected
transactions are companies with operations, results, market sizes and product profiles that, for the purpose
of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of those of the Company.

of June 30, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Company, to
derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs divided the range of illustrative
equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock as of August
1, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Company, calculated
using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied values per share of Ping Identity common stock
of $23.48 to $35.76.
Premia Analysis.
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for 160
cash transactions announced during the last ten years involving a public technology, media or
telecommunications company listed in the United States as the target, where the enterprise value was above
$1 billion. Using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated for the entire period the median,
25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s last
undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a
median premium of 28%, a 25th percentile premium of 18% and a 75th percentile premium of 44% across the
period. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference
range of illustrative premia of 18% to 44% to the Company share price of $17.17 as of August 1, 2022, and
calculated a range of implied values per share of Ping Identity common stock of $20.25 to $24.72.
Selected Public Company Comparables.
Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following high-
growth publicly traded corporations in the cybersecurity industry, which are collectively referred to as the
“selected cybersecurity companies”:
Cyberark Software Ltd.
ForgeRock, Inc.
Tenable Holdings, Inc.
Rapid7, Inc.
Goldman Sachs also reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following
publicly traded corporations in the software infrastructure industry, which are collectively referred to as the
“selected infrastructure software companies”:
JFrog Ltd.
Jamf Holding Corp.
Pagerduty, Inc.
Splunk Inc.
Alteryx, Inc.
Informatica Inc.
New Relic, Inc.
The selected cybersecurity companies and the selected infrastructure software companies are collectively
referred to as the “comparable companies.” Although none of the comparable companies are directly
comparable to the Company, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies in the cybersecurity industry and software infrastructure industry, respectively, with operations
that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of August 1, 2022 as a multiple of NTM
revenue for the Company and the comparable companies, based on financial and trading data as of August 1,
2022 and information from FactSet, publicly available historical and market data and IBES estimates.

General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all
of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board
as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the
$28.50 in cash per share of Ping Identity common stock to be paid such holders pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the
Company, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially
different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and
Parent and was approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these
negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific merger consideration to the
Company or the Board or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the transaction.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the Board in making its determination to approve the transaction. The foregoing summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the
fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached
as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and
services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and
51

funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which
they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in
securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments
of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Vista Equity Partners
LLC (“Vista”), an affiliate of a significant equityholder of the Company, and Thoma Bravo, L.P. (“Thoma
Bravo”), an affiliate of a significant equityholder of Parent, and any of their respective affiliates and, as
applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to the Company in
connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transaction. Goldman
Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in connection with the transaction, the principal portion of
which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse
certain of its expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of
its engagement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and
may receive, compensation. During the two-year period ended July 21, 2022, Goldman Sachs did not
recognize compensation for its financial advisor and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment
Banking Division to the Company and/or its affiliates. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to Vista and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time
for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having
acted as left lead bookrunner with respect to a follow-on offering of JAMF Holding Corp., a portfolio
company of Vista, of 11,000,000 shares of its common stock in November 2020; and as lead left bookrunner
with respect to the initial public offering of PowerSchool Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of Vista, of
39,473,685 shares of its Class A common stock in July 2021. During the two-year period ended July 21, 2022,
Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisor and/or underwriting services provided by
its Investment Banking Division to Vista and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $192
million. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Thoma
Bravo and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking
Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as bookrunner with respect to
the initial public offering of McAfee Corp. (“McAfee”), a portfolio company of Thoma Bravo, of 23,000,000
shares of its Class A common stock in October 2020; as financial advisor to Thoma Bravo with respect to its
acquisition of RealPage, Inc. in December 2020; as bookrunner with respect to the initial public offering by
Thoma Bravo Advantage, an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, of 100,000,000 units in January 2021; as financial
advisor to McAfee in the sale of certain assets of its enterprise business in March 2021; as financial advisor
to Thoma Bravo LLC, an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, with respect to its acquisition of Proofpoint, Inc. in
August 2021; and as financial advisor to McAfee with respect to its sale in November 2021. During the two-
year period ended July 21, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisor and/or
underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates and
portfolio companies of approximately $80 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent, Vista, Thoma Bravo and their respective
affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which its Investment Banking Division may receive
compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with Vista, Thoma Bravo and their
respective affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of
Thoma Bravo and Vista from time to time and may do so in the future.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transaction. Pursuant
to a letter agreement dated July 23, 2022, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor
in connection with the transaction. The letter agreement between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides
for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement
of the transaction, at approximately $39 million, $7.5 million of which became payable upon execution of the
Merger Agreement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In
addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including
attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various
liabilities, including certain liabilities under federal securities laws.

Ping Identity Holding Corp._20220916_DEFM14A_20342713_4518798.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
Ping Identity does not, in the ordinary course, make long-term projections as to future performance available
to the public (other than certain financial targets for fiscal year 2024 that were disclosed at the Company’s
investor day in December 2021), given, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial
performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be
realized. In the ordinary course and in preparation for its Investor Day on December 1, 2022, Ping Identity
prepared an updated strategic plan setting forth annual recurring revenue projections for fiscal year 2021
through 2024 (the “November Strategic Plan”), which was reviewed with the Board on November 2, 2021. In
connection with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, senior management prepared certain
unaudited prospective financial information for Ping Identity. Financial projections for the remainder of fiscal
year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2036 were prepared by senior management and reviewed and
approved for use by the Ping Identity Board on June 3, 2022 (the “June Projections”). Following the
completion of Ping Identity’s second fiscal quarter, management updated the financial projections to reflect
Ping Identity’s actual performance for the second quarter of 2022 (the “Updated Projections”) and certain
forecasts related to the expected utilization by the Company of certain net operating loss carryforwards and
R&D credit carryforwards of the Company that had been prepared by the Company’s management (the “Tax
Attributes Forecasts” and together with the November Strategic Plan, the June Projections and the Updated
Projections, the “Projections”). The Projections were prepared by senior management at the direction of the
Ping Identity Board. The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and,
accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC or established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Ping Identity’s independent registered
public accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the
Projections, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or
its achievability.
The tables below present summaries of the November Strategic Plan, the June Projections, the Updated
Projections and the Tax Attributes Forecasts, as prepared by senior management and provided by senior
management to the Ping Identity Board. The Projections were also provided to Goldman Sachs for use and
reliance by Goldman Sachs in connection with its financial analyses and in connection with its opinion to the
Ping Identity Board as described above under the heading “- Opinion of Goldman Sachs”. In addition, the
June Projections, excluding the financial projections for the fiscal years 2027 through 2036, were provided to
the participants in the strategic process, including Thoma Bravo, for purposes of their due diligence review
of Ping Identity. The Projections summarized below are included solely to provide Ping Identity stockholders
access to financial projections that were made available to the Ping Identity Board, the Transaction
Committee, Goldman Sachs and/or Thoma Bravo in connection with the proposed Merger, and are not
included in this proxy statement to influence a Ping Identity stockholder’s decision whether to vote to adopt
the Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.
The Projections summarized below, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future
economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict and many of which are beyond Ping Identity’s control. The Projections also reflect assumptions that
are subject to change, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding: growth rates; market share;
market size and conditions; products and product mix; contract duration expansion; renewal rates;
annualized recurring revenue; operating expenses; margins; and net working capital. The Projections cover
multiple years, and thus, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive
year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Projections include, but are
not limited to: general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit or securities
markets; industry and market dynamics; competition; and those risks and uncertainties described in Ping
Identity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. See also the section entitled “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this proxy statement.
In addition, the Projections reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple
interpretations based on actual results, revised prospects for Ping Identity’s business, changes in
53 (1) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may
occur and that was not anticipated when the Projections were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will
differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Projections. The Projections assume organic
company growth without business expansions from mergers and acquisitions or alternative business or
licensing models. In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or
events occurring after the date on which the Projections were prepared and do not give effect to any
changes or expenses incurred after the date on which they were made, including as a result of the Merger or
any effects of the Merger. Ping Identity does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to
reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections were prepared or to reflect the
occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be
in error. There can be no assurance that the financial results in the Projections will be realized, or that future
actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the Projections.
Certain of the measures included in the Projections are financial measures that are not calculated in
accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP
financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures, because they exclude charges
and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC’s rules
concerning non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures
of non-GAAP financial measures in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the
Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement, which would otherwise
require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of
non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared or relied upon by the Ping Identity Board in connection
with its consideration of the Merger Agreement or by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its financial analyses.
Accordingly, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of any financial measures included in the
Projections.

If the Merger Proposal is approved and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ping Identity upon the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement. As the surviving corporation in the Merger, Ping Identity will continue to exist following the
Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Following the Merger, all of the Ping Identity common stock will be beneficially owned by Parent and none of
the Company’s current stockholders will have any direct ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the
Company, the surviving corporation or Parent after the consummation of the Merger. As a result, the
Company’s current stockholders will no longer have the potential to benefit from any increase in the value,
nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Ping Identity common stock. Following the Merger,
Parent will have the potential to benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and also will bear the risk
of any decrease in the Company’s value.
At the Effective Time, and without any action by any stockholder, each share of Ping Identity common stock
that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Ping
Identity common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their statutory rights of
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be automatically canceled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Please
see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Consideration to be Received in the
Merger.”
Immediately prior to the Effective Time:
Ping Identity Stock Options: Each Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share less than the Merger
Consideration, whether vested or unvested, will, at the Effective Time, be automatically canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ping Identity common stock
subject to such stock option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such stock option. Each Option with an
exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled
automatically at the Effective Time for no consideration.
Ping Identity Vested RSU Awards: Each Vested RSU will automatically, at the Effective Time, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for
any other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Ping Identity

We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will
be approximately $2.8 billion, which will be funded via equity financing described below. Parent and Merger
Sub have represented to Ping Identity in the Merger Agreement that the aggregate proceeds from the Equity
Financing are sufficient to make all payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including payment of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration and repayment of certain indebtedness of the Company as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement) to be paid at the closing of the Merger by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company and all fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing by the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub in connection with the Merger and the Equity Financing.
Parent has obtained a commitment from the Thoma Bravo Fund to provide equity pursuant to the terms of
the Equity Commitment Letter. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub delivered to Ping Identity a copy of the Equity Commitment Letter. Other than as expressly set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full proceeds of the Equity Financing. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to
the contrary, in no event will the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Equity Commitment Letter
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, the Thoma Bravo Fund has committed to contribute or cause to
be contributed to Parent at the closing of the Merger certain equity financing for the purpose of allowing
Parent and/or Merger Sub to fully fund (i) the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable by Parent and/or
Merger Sub, (ii) the repayment of certain indebtedness of the Company and (iii) related fees and expenses to
be paid at the closing pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
The obligations of the Thoma Bravo Fund to provide the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment
Letter are subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement and (ii) the satisfaction or written waiver by the parties to the Merger Agreement, as
applicable, of each of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 of the Merger Agreement (other than
any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the prior or substantially
concurrent satisfaction or valid waiver of such conditions at the closing). The funding of the Equity
Financing will occur substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Merger.
The obligation of the Thoma Bravo Fund to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately
terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of the closing of the Merger and the payment in
full of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, certain indebtedness of the Company and related fees and
expenses to be paid at the closing, (ii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms, and (iii) the occurrence of any event which terminates the Thoma Bravo Fund’s obligations or
liabilities under the Limited Guaranty in accordance with its terms.
Ping Identity is an express third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter solely with respect to
enforcing Parent’s right to cause the commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter to be funded by the
Fund to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights
against the Thoma Bravo Fund to perform its funding obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, in
each case, subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

Details of the beneficial ownership of Ping Identity common stock by the Company’s non-employee directors
and executive officers are set forth in the section of this proxy statement titled “- Security Ownership of
Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.” In addition to their interests in the Merger as stockholders,
the Company’s non-employee directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. In considering the
proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting, you should be aware of these interests. Members of the
Ping Identity Board and the Transaction Committee were aware of and considered these interests in reaching
the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and to declare that the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were advisable and in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and in recommending that the holders of Ping Identity common stock
vote for adoption of the Merger Agreement.

December 31, 2021, and did not receive any severance benefits in connection with her departure from
the Company;

B. Kristian Nagel, our former Chief Operating Officer, resigned from his employment with the
Company, effective as of July 15, 2022, he did not receive any severance benefits in connection with
his departure from the Company, and will serve in an advisory role through September 30, 2022;
each non-employee director and executive officer holds the outstanding equity awards that were held
by each non-employee director and such executive officer as of September 12, 2022 the latest
practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement; and
the amounts set forth below regarding executive officer compensation are based on compensation
levels as of September 12, 2022.

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and the ESPP
For additional information regarding beneficial ownership of Ping Identity common stock by each of Ping
Identity’s non-employee directors and executive officers and beneficial ownership of Ping Identity common
stock by all non-employee directors and executive officers as a group, please see the section of this proxy
statement titled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.” Each of Ping
Identity’s non-employee directors and executive officers will be entitled to receive, for each share of Ping
Identity common stock he or she holds as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the same
Merger Consideration in cash in the same manner as other holders of Ping Identity common stock.
Each of Ping Identity’s non-employee directors hold RSUs, except for Messer. Fosnaugh, Aliabadi, Breach
and Taylor, who are representatives of Vista and receive no compensation for their service as directors on
our board. Ping Identity’s executive officers hold RSUs, PSUs and Options that will be afforded the treatment
described below. Ping Identity’s non-employee directors do not hold any outstanding PSUs or Options.
Under our equity incentive programs, we have granted Options, and we continue to grant restricted stock
units (“RSUs”) and performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) to our employees and executive officers, to
incentivize and reward them for our long-term corporate performance based on the value of Company
60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Common Stock. Certain of our non-employee directors are granted RSUs under our equity incentive
programs in accordance with the terms of our non-employee director compensation policy (the “Director
Compensation Policy”). We have granted Options pursuant to the 2016 Stock Option Plan (the “2016 Plan”)
and we have granted Options, RSUs (including RSUs held by our non-employee directors) and PSUs
pursuant to the Ping Identity Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”). In addition, Ping Identity
maintains the Ping Identity Holding Corp. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Ping Identity ESPP”).
The RSU award agreements with Ping Identity’s executive officers provide for RSU awards to be immediately
earned and payable if the executive officer incurs a termination without cause, for good reason, death or
disability (a “Qualifying Termination”) within 24 months following a change in control, which will include
completion of the Merger. The PSU award agreements with Ping Identity’s executive officers provide for the
PSU awards to be immediately earned and payable if following a change in control, which will include
completion of the Merger, but prior to the applicable vesting determination, the executive officer incurs a
Qualifying Termination.
At the Effective Time, all Ping Identity equity awards, including awards held by our non-employee directors
and executive officers, that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will generally be subject
to the following treatment:
Options
The Merger Agreement provides that each Option with an exercise price per share less than $28.50 that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding, whether vested or unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of $28.50 over the per share exercise price of such Option.
Each Option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $28.50 will be canceled automatically at
the Effective Time for no consideration.
RSUs
Each vested RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any RSU that vests in
accordance with its terms as a result of the consummation of the Merger (a “Vested RSU”) will, at the
Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) $28.50.
Each RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested RSU (an “Unvested
RSU”) will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and replaced with a contingent right to receive an amount in
cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested RSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) $28.50 (the “Cash Replacement RSU Amounts”), which Cash Replacement RSU
Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates, generally vest
and be payable at the same time as the RSUs for which the Cash Replacement RSU Amounts were exchanged
and based on the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as applied to the RSU for
which the Cash Replacement RSU Amount was exchanged.
PSUs
Each vested PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any PSU that vests in
accordance with its terms as a result of the consummation of the Merger (a “Vested PSU”) will, at the
Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) $28.50.
Each PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested PSU (an “Unvested
PSU”) will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and replaced with a contingent right to receive an
61 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested PSU (with any applicable
performance conditions deemed achieved at target levels of performance) as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) $28.50 (the “Cash Replacement PSU Amounts”), which Cash Replacement PSU
Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates, generally vest
and be payable at the same time as the PSUs for which the Cash Replacement PSU Amounts were exchanged
and based on the same terms and conditions (including with respect to time-based vesting), as applied to the
PSU for which the Cash Replacement PSU Amount was exchanged.
At or prior to the closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with Ping Identity, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, the aggregate vested equity award consideration owed to all holders of
Options, Vested RSUs and Vested PSUs (collectively, the “Vested Equity Award Holders”). As promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is in no
less than five business days after the closing date, the Vested Equity Award Holders will be paid by Ping
Identity or the surviving corporation, through its payroll system, payroll provider, all amounts required to be
paid to such holders in respect of Options, Vested RSUs and Vested PSUs that are canceled and converted
into a cash payment, less any required withholding.
Ping Identity ESPP
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as soon as practicable following August 2, 2022, Ping Identity will
ensure that (i) except for the offering period in effect as of such date, no new offering periods will be
authorized or commenced under the Ping Identity ESPP, (ii) no new participants will commence participation
in the Ping Identity ESPP, (iii) no participant will be permitted to increase such participant’s payroll
deduction elections or contribution rates, (iv) each purchase right outstanding under the Ping Identity ESPP
as of August 2, 2022 will be exercised no later than three business days prior to the Effective Time, (v) each
participant’s accumulated contributions will be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock on such
final exercise date, and (vi) the Ping Identity ESPP will be terminated effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All shares of Company Common Stock purchased on the final exercise date under the Ping
Identity ESPP will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive $28.50, without
interest thereon.
Double-Trigger RSU and PSU Awards
The RSU award agreements provided that all RSUs held by the executive officers, will immediately become
fully earned and payable in the event of a Qualifying Termination of such employee’s employment within the
24-month period following a consummation of a “Change in Control”  (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) of
Ping Identity. The PSU award agreements provided that all PSUs held by the executive officers, will
immediately become fully earned and payable if following a consummation of a Change in Control of Ping
Identity, but prior to the applicable vesting determination, the employee incurs a Qualifying Termination.
Quantification of Potential Payments for Equity Awards
The table below sets forth (i) the number of Options, and unvested PSUs and RSUs, as applicable, as of
September 12, 2022, the assumed date of the Merger solely for the purposes of this disclosure, and held by
each executive officer of Ping Identity (and our other named executive officers other than Ms. Romer) and
each non-employee member of the Board, and (ii) the estimated value of those awards (on a pre-tax basis).
These values have been calculated assuming the price of a share of Ping Identity’s common stock is $28.50,
which represents the per share price of the Merger Consideration. The actual value realized with respect to
any Options, PSUs or RSUs cannot be determined with any certainty until the awards are settled.

directors will accelerate and fully vest “single-trigger” in connection with the Merger.
Severance Entitlements
Each of Ping Identity’s current executive officers is a party to a letter agreement (each referred to as an
“executive agreement”) that provides for certain severance payments and benefits in connection with certain
terminations of employment.
63

(3)
(1)
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Mr. Durand’s, Mr. Dani’s and Ms. Sharma’s executive agreement provide that, upon termination of
employment by Ping Identity without “cause” or a resignation for “good reason”  (together an “Executive
Qualifying Termination”), the executive officer will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment
equal to 12 months, 9 months and 6 months of annual base salary, respectively. Upon an Executive
Qualifying Termination, Mr. Durand is also entitled to monthly cash payments equal to our contribution
toward health insurance for up to 12 months following such a termination or resignation.
For purposes of the executive agreements, “cause” generally means a material failure to perform
responsibilities or duties, engaging in illegal or improper conduct or in gross misconduct in the fulfillment of
responsibilities or duties, commission or conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony, a
crime involving moral turpitude or any other act or omission that the Company in good faith believes may
harm the standing and reputation of the Company, a material breach of a duty of loyalty to the Company or
material breach of the Company’s written code of conduct and business ethics or of certain restrictive
covenants imposed on the executive, dishonesty, fraud, gross negligence or repetitive negligence committed
without regard to corrective direction in the course of discharge of duties as an employee, personal
bankruptcy or insolvency, or excessive and unreasonable absences from duties for any reason (other than
authorized vacation or sick leave) or as a result of disability.
For purposes of the executive agreements, “good reason” generally means a material, adverse change in the
duties or responsibilities of the executive, an aggregate reduction in the executive’s base salary by more than
10% or a reduction less than 10% that is not applied to other executive officers, a material breach by the
Company of any offer letter or employment agreement with the executive, or a relocation of more than fifty
miles of the executive’s primary place of work.
The foregoing severance payments and benefits under the executive agreements are subject to the delivery
of an effective separation and release agreement by the executive officer containing, among other provisions,
a general release of claims in favor of the Company. None of the executive agreements provide for any tax
gross-up payments.
In connection with his departure from the Company, Mr. Harguindeguy entered into a separation agreement
with the Company on July 31, 2022 (referred to as the “Harguindeguy Separation Agreement”), pursuant to
which he was entitled to receive (i) a lump sum payment of $75,000 and (ii) health insurance coverage for him
and his eligible dependents through the earliest of (a) December 31, 2022, (b) the date he and his dependents
become ineligible for such coverage, and (c) the date he and his dependents become eligible for coverage
from another employer. The payments and benefits under the Harguindeguy Separation Agreement were
subject to the execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims by Mr. Harguindeguy in favor of
Ping Identity.
Mr. Nagel did not receive and is not eligible to receive any severance benefits upon his termination of
employment with the Company.
The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits for each of Messrs. Durand and Dani is set
forth below in the table entitled “- Quantification of Payments and Benefits”.
280G Mitigation Actions
Under the Merger Agreement, Ping Identity may take certain actions before the Effective Time to mitigate the
amount of potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals”  (each as defined in Section
280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), including the executive officers,
except that without the consent of Parent, (i) the vesting and payment for any RSUs or PSUs held by any
disqualified individual may not be accelerated, (ii) no additional compensation or benefits may be provided
to any disqualified individual that is not otherwise permitted pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (iii) no
gross-ups will be paid with respect to any such excess parachute payments. As of the date of this
information statement, Ping Identity has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of
Section 280G of the Code on Ping Identity or any disqualified individuals. No executive officer is entitled to
receive gross-ups or tax reimbursements from Ping with respect to any potential excise taxes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ping Identity Non-Employee Director Compensation
Under the Merger Agreement, Ping Identity may continue to pay non-employee members of the Board their
annual fees, retainers, reimbursements and stipends, in each case, without proration and in accordance with
the terms of the Director Compensation Policy. As described above in the section entitled “Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” all RSUs held by non-employee directors will
accelerate and fully vest “single-trigger” in connection with the closing of the Merger.
Other Interests
As of the date of this information statement, none of our directors or executive officers has entered into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with Parent regarding employment or service with, or
compensation following the Merger to be paid by, Parent. Prior to the closing of the Merger, however, our
directors or executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements, arrangements or understandings with
Parent regarding employment or service with, or compensation following the Merger, to be paid by Parent.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation
of each of Ping Identity’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and
that will or may become payable to Ping Identity’s named executive officers at the consummation of the
Merger or upon a Qualifying Termination of employment that occurs within 24 months following the
consummation of the Merger, assuming (i) the closing had occurred on September 12, 2022, (ii) each of the
named executive officers experiences a Qualifying Termination on such date, (iii) the named executive
officers’ respective base salaries remain unchanged from those that were in effect as of the date of this filing,
(iv) Options, PSUs and RSUs held by the named executive officers that are outstanding as of the date hereof
do not otherwise vest prior to the completion of the Merger, (v) for purposes of determining the value of
Options, PSUs and RSUs, the value of a share of Company Common Stock is equal to $28.50, (vi) no named
executive officer receives any additional equity grants prior to completion of the Merger, and (vii) each
named executive officer has properly executed any required releases and complied with all requirements
(including any applicable restrictive covenants) necessary in order to receive the payments and benefits
described below. Some of the assumptions used in the table below are based upon estimates of information
not currently available (see the footnotes to the table below) and, as a result, the actual amounts to be
received by any of the individuals below may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. No amounts
are reflected below for Ms. Romer as she separated from employment with the Company on December 31,
2021 and did not receive and is not entitled to receive any payments or benefits required to be disclosed by
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K.
The payments described in the table below would be made pursuant to the arrangements described above in

The amounts in this column attributable to PSUs and RSUs are considered to be “double-trigger,” which
means that both a “Change in Control” of Ping Identity, such as the Merger, and a qualifying

Potential Future Arrangements
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of the Company’s executive officers has discussed or entered
into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or
participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the
Merger, however, certain executive officers of the Company may have discussions, or may enter into
agreements with, Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to
purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Ping Identity’s directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies. See “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification of Directors and Officers and Insurance.”",68,75

The following discussion summarizes certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to
holders of Ping Identity common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Ping Identity common
stock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based
upon the provisions of the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial
decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement and all of which are
subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing
interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements set forth herein. The U.S. federal income tax laws
are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service (referred to herein as the “IRS”) regarding any of the tax issues discussed
herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences of the
Merger described in this proxy statement.
This discussion assumes that holders of Ping Identity common stock hold their shares as “capital assets”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular

holder of Ping Identity common stock in light of such holder’s individual circumstances, nor does it address
U.S. state or local, non-U.S., or estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified
small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code, the Medicare tax on net investment
income or any other aspect of any U.S. federal tax other than the income tax. This discussion also does not
address tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of Ping Identity common stock subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions, brokers or
dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds, partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities and their partners or
members, S corporations, tax-exempt organizations, governmental organizations, retirement or other tax-
deferred accounts, insurance companies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market method of
accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term
residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Ping Identity common stock through the exercise
of Company stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who hold their Ping Identity common
stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below)
whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment
companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Ping Identity common stock under the constructive sale
provisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) an equity interest in Parent
or the surviving corporation and holders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under
the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Ping Identity
common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the
partner and activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership holding Ping Identity
common stock or a partner of a partnership holding Ping Identity common stock, you are urged to consult
your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger relevant to you.
This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of Ping Identity common stock are
urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in
light of their particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the Merger arising under the U.S. federal
tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, “golden parachute” rules, or
under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Ping Identity common
stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;
a trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States
and one or more U.S. persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of the Code); and
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Ping Identity common
stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate that is not
a U.S. holder.",75,76

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Ping Identity common stock pursuant to the Merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
67 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
cash received pursuant to the Merger (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes)
and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share of Ping Identity common stock will generally be equal to the amount
the U.S. holder paid for such share. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-
term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of
the closing. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are
generally eligible for a reduced rate of federal income taxation. Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary
income rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss must be calculated
separately for each block of Ping Identity common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and at
the same price in a single transaction). U.S. holders who own separate blocks of Ping Identity common stock should
consult their own tax advisors with respect to these rules.
A U.S. holder may, unless an exception applies, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding
(currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the Merger, unless such U.S. holder
provides its correct taxpayer identification number (referred to as the “TIN”) on IRS Form W-9 (or if
appropriate, a substitute or successor form) and certifies under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct
and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S.
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required
information to the IRS in a timely manner and other requirements are satisfied.",76,77

Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment
or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder),
in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as
a U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such corporation may be subject to
branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income
tax treaty) on earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business, subject to certain adjustments;
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-
U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at such lower rate as may be specified under
an applicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder’s net gain realized in the Merger, which may
be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any (even though the
individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that such non-U.S. holder has
timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or
the Company is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal
income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of (1) the five-year period ending on the date of
the Merger and (2) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period in the Ping Identity common stock, and, at
any time during such period, the non-U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more
than 5% of the outstanding Ping Identity common stock. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real
property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or
exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other
assets used or held for use in a trade or business. The Company does not believe that it was and
does not expect that it will be a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal
income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding
(currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received by such non-U.S. holder pursuant to the

U.S. Antitrust
The obligations of Parent and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the waiting period
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act. Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until notifications have been filed and certain information has
been furnished to the FTC and the DOJ and the specified waiting period has expired or has been terminated.
The Company and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act
with the DOJ and the FTC on August 8, 2022. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 PM EDT
on September 7, 2022. Both before and after the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the
DOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds.
In addition, the Merger may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which Parent
and the Company operate. These authorities may claim that there is authority, under the applicable state and
federal antitrust laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to prohibit the Merger under the
circumstances and based on the standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can be no
assurance that one or more state attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the
Merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, neither Parent nor the Company has been notified by any
state attorney general indicating any plan to review the Merger.
Other Regulatory Notifications
The consummation of the Merger is also conditioned upon the clearance or approval by the antitrust
authorities in certain other jurisdictions and other relevant authorities under foreign investment laws. The
Merger cannot be completed until Ping Identity and Parent obtain clearance to consummate the Merger or
the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions.
There can be no assurances that all of the required regulatory approvals will be obtained and, if obtained,
there can be no assurances as to the timing of any approvals.
The Merger Agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties, with respect to filings under the
HSR Act and foreign regulatory laws, to supply (or cause to be supplied) information that may be required to
make such filings or any additional information that may be requested by the FTC, DOJ, or other
governmental authorities in which such a filing is made, to cooperate and coordinate (and to cause their

reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective affiliates), all actions
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to (1) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods pursuant to the HSR Act and obtain any foreign regulatory consents applicable to the Merger as
promptly as practicable and (2) obtain all clearances, consents, approvals, waivers, actions, non-actions, or
other authorizations pursuant to the HSR Act and any foreign regulatory laws applicable to the Merger as
promptly as practicable. For more information regarding these covenants, see the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Filings.”
Litigation Related to the Merger
In connection with the Merger Agreement, one complaint has been filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York and is captioned O’Dell v. Ping Identity Holding Corp., et al., 22-cv-
7770 (filed September 12, 2022). The foregoing complaint is referred to as the “Merger Action.” The Merger
Action generally alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on
September 6, 2022 misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the
Company’s financial projections and the analyses performed by the financial advisor to the Ping Identity
Board in connection with the Merger. The Merger Action asserts violations of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a),
and SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. § 244.100, and violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act against Ping Identity’s directors and officers. The Merger Action seeks, among other
things, an injunction enjoining the stockholder vote on the Merger and the consummation of the Merger
unless and until certain additional information is disclosed to Ping Identity stockholders, costs of the action,
including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees, and other relief the court may deem just and proper.
The Company cannot predict the outcome of the Merger Action. The Company believes that the Merger
Action is without merit and Ping Identity and the individual defendants intend to vigorously defend against
the Merger Action and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed,
absent new or significantly different allegations, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional
filings.",79,79

and governs the legal relations between the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and allocates risks between

the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made
to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates specified in the Merger
Agreement. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for
purposes of the contract between the respective parties and are subject to representations, warranties,

disclosure letter made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger
Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts), and may be subject to standards of materiality
applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors, security holders, or
securities laws. Investors and security holders are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement
and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company also agreed to, within two business days following the execution of the Merger Agreement,
request that all non-public information previously provided by or on behalf of Ping Identity or any of its
subsidiaries to any third party with whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into during the six-month
period immediately preceding the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal be
returned or destroyed, and agreed to immediately cease and cause its subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions,
communications or negotiations with any person (other than the parties to the Merger Agreement and their
respective representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal and shut off all access granted to
any such person to any electronic data room.
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement
and the Effective Time, the Company will be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate
or modify, any provision of any standstill or similar provision that prohibits a proposal being made to the
Ping Identity Board unless the Ping Identity Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.
If, at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the
Merger Agreement and the Company’s receipt of the Ping Identity stockholder approval, the Ping Identity
Board receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Ping Identity Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company is entitled to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with and furnish any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is
provided to such person and was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) following the time it is provided to such person.
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, Ping Identity agreed to as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within 48 hours) notify Parent of Ping Identity’s receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice
must include the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company must also keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and any related
discussions or negotiations.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide written offer or
proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub) to engage in an Acquisition Transaction.
Furthermore, the term “Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions
(other than the Merger) involving:
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of shares of more than 20% of the outstanding
Ping Identity common stock, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in a person beneficially owning more than 20% of the Ping Identity
common stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer;
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of more than 20% of the consolidated assets, net
revenue or net income of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Ping Identity Board);
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or other transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which
any person would hold, directly or indirectly, shares of Ping Identity common stock representing more
than 20% of the equity interests of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction after giving
effect to the consummation of such transaction; or
any combination of the foregoing.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
will not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Acquisition Proposal” means any Acquisition Proposal for an
Acquisition Transaction on terms that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a financial point of view,
to the Company Stockholders than the Merger (taking into account any legal, regulatory, financial, timing,
financing and other aspects of such proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) considers
relevant and any revisions to the Merger Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter made or proposed in
writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition
Proposal” in this definition, all references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be
deemed to be references to “50%”.
Ping Identity Board Recommendation Change
The Ping Identity Board may not (any of the following actions, a “Company Board Recommendation
Change”):
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, its
recommendation to Ping Identity stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Company Board
Recommendation”)in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;
adopt, approve or recommend to the Company’s stockholders an Acquisition Proposal;
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy statement;
fail to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company’s
stockholders within ten business days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the
Exchange Act if an Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced; or
other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer, fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten business days after Parent so
requests in writing (with the Company having no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than
three separate occasions).
In addition, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company may enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Ping
Identity stockholder approval, the Ping Identity Board or any committee of the Ping Identity Board may make
a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to (i) a Superior Proposal, if it determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (ii) any change, event, effect, development
or circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable or the consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on the date of the Merger Agreement and does not
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or to the mere fact that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published financial projections or forecasts for any period ending on or after the date the Merger Agreement
(an “Intervening Event”), if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject in each case to
compliance with the procedures described below.
In the case of a Superior Proposal, no adverse recommendation change and/or termination of the Merger
Agreement may be made:
until after the third business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising Parent
that the Ping Identity Board intends to resolve to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal and specifying the reasons, including the identity of the third party
making, such Superior Proposal, the material terms of such Superior Proposal and copies of all
relevant agreements relating to such Superior Proposal (with any amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Superior Proposal requiring a new notice of superior proposal with a
new notice period of two business days); and

enable such record date to be set for a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
stockholder approval of the Merger (the “Special Meeting”). The Company agreed to hold the Special
Meeting as promptly as practicable following the clearance of the proxy statement by the SEC (but no earlier
than 30 days following the mailing of the proxy statement to the Company’s stockholders).
The Company may postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting:
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the stockholder approval (provided that the
stockholder meeting will not be so delayed by more than 15 business days without the prior consent
of Parent);
for the absence of a quorum (provided that the stockholder meeting will not be so delayed by more
than 15 business days without the prior consent of Parent);
if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the stockholder meeting by applicable law or a
request from the SEC or its staff; or
in order to give the Company’s stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure
that the Company has sent or other made available to its stockholders (including in connection with
any Company Board Recommendation Change) (provided that the stockholder meeting will not be so
delayed by more than 5 business days).
Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company has agreed to use
reasonable efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Unless the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, the Company will submit the Merger
Agreement for a vote by its stockholders at the Special Meeting even if the Ping Identity Board (or a
committee thereof) has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.
The Company has agreed to ensure that the proxy statement will not, on the date it is first disseminated to
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
85 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. However, the
Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy statement. Parent and Merger Sub agreed to
ensure that such information supplied by them for inclusion in the proxy statement will not, on the date it is
first disseminated to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.
If at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement, any
other required Company filing or any other required Parent filing, as the case may be, so that such filing
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, then the party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information will be promptly prepared
and filed with the SEC by the appropriate party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its
staff, disseminated to the Company’s stockholders.
Subject to applicable law, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the proxy statement to be
disseminated to Ping Identity’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event more
than three business days, following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will
not review, or that it has completed its review of, the proxy statement, which confirmation will be deemed to

not review, or that it has completed its review of, the proxy statement, which confirmation will be deemed to
have occurred if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
tenth calendar day following such filing with the SEC that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the proxy
statement.",94,95

Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Ping Identity that:
Parent has delivered to Ping Identity a true, accurate and complete copy of the duly executed Equity
Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Thoma
Bravo Fund has committed to invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein (the “Equity Financing”).
The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Ping Identity is an express third party beneficiary
thereof in order to cause the Thoma Bravo Fund to fund the Equity Financing.
As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto. As of the date of the
Merger Agreement, the commitments in the Equity Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
terminated, replaced or rescinded. As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified in any respect.
The Equity Commitment Letter is the only agreement relating to the Equity Financing. Other than as
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, there are no other agreements, side letters, or
arrangements, conditions precedent or other contingencies relating to the Equity Commitment Letter.
As of the date of the Merger Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or the other parties to
the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the Equity Financing
required to be satisfied by them or (iii) otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing to be
unavailable or materially delayed. Assuming satisfaction of the closing conditions to the Merger, as
of the date of the Merger Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any term or condition of the Equity Financing required to be satisfied by Parent or
that the Equity Financing completed by the Equity Commitment Letter will not be available to Parent
and/or Merger Sub on the closing date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company with respect to its
capital stock and compliance by the Company with certain specified covenants in all material
respects, the aggregate proceeds of the Equity Financing will be sufficient to (i) make all payments
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Aggregate Merger Consideration) to be paid at
the closing by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect
to the Merger) the principal of and interest on, and all other indebtedness outstanding pursuant to
certain of the Company’s indebtedness as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iii) pay all

Commitment Letter;
if all of the conditions precedent to the funding of the Equity Financing are satisfied, consummate the
Equity Financing at or prior to the closing;
comply with its obligations pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter; and
enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter.
Parent will not permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the
Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be
expected to, (i) reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing, (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Equity Financing, (iii) have the effect of preventing, materially impeding, materially delaying or
otherwise materially adversely affecting the closing or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the Thoma Bravo Fund under the Equity Commitment
Letter.
In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors,
representatives and other agents to use their reasonable best efforts, to provide Parent and Merger Sub with
all customary cooperation as is reasonably requested by Parent to arrange, syndicate and obtain debt
financing (if any) to be obtained by Parent and/or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates in connection with
the Merger (the “Debt Financing”), including using reasonable best efforts in:
causing management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions (upon reasonable
request) with rating agencies to the extent customary for the Debt Financing at times and locations to
be mutually agreed;
assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings agencies to the
extent required in connection with the Debt Financing, including providing reasonable and customary
assistance to Parent with the preparation of customary rating agency presentations and bank
information memoranda required in connection with the Debt Financing;
assisting Parent in connection with the preparation and execution of any pledge and security
documents and other definitive financing documents (including, to the extent regarding the Company
or its subsidiaries, the schedules thereto and the execution (but not the preparation) of a customary
solvency certificate);
furnishing Parent with (A) customary information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent to the extent that such information is of the type and form

directors of the Company will not approve the Debt Financing prior to the closing date; and
at least four business days prior to the closing date, furnishing Parent with all customary
documentation and other information with respect to the Company required by U.S. regulatory
authorities pursuant to applicable “know your customer”, beneficial ownership and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations.
The Company or its subsidiaries will not be required to:
waive or amend any terms of the Merger Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Effective Time;
enter into any definitive agreement the effectiveness of which is not conditioned upon the closing
(other than the execution of customary authorization letters, representation letters and ratings agency
engagement letters in connection with its obligations discussed above);
give any indemnities that are effective prior to the Effective Time;

subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and all liabilities incurred by them in
connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing under the Merger Agreement, except if
such liabilities are a result of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, its

As of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Ping
Identity and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or
officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Ping Identity or any of its subsidiaries prior to
the
88 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective Time), on the other hand (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors and administrators, an
“Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, for a period of six years
following the Effective Time, the surviving company or any of its subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the
surviving company and its subsidiaries to, cause all the organizational documents of the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement and
reimbursement of expenses provisions set forth in the organizational documents as of August 2, 2022, which
provisions will not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable law.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause
the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in effect on August 2, 2022, each Indemnified Person from and against
any costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection
with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, to the
extent that such legal proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to the
fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Ping Identity or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates; any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates,
or taken at the request of Ping Identity or such subsidiary or affiliate (including in connection with serving at
the request of the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another person (including any employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and the Merger, as
well as any actions taken by Ping Identity, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any
disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered
the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent).
If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such
legal proceeding, the surviving corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses
of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such legal proceeding. None of
Parent, the surviving corporation nor any of their respective affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any legal
proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all
liability arising out of such legal proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether
the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by
independent legal counsel selected by the surviving corporation (which counsel will be reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the surviving
corporation.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause
the surviving corporation to, maintain in effect Ping Identity’s current directors’ and officers’ liability and
similar insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms
(including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those
of Ping Identity’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided that in no event will the
surviving corporation be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 400% of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is referred to as the maximum annual
premium. If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the maximum annual premium, then the
surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the maximum annual premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Ping
Identity’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. In satisfaction of the foregoing
obligations, prior to the Effective Time Ping Identity may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the
Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as Ping Identity’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the
aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the maximum annual premium. If the Company elects to
purchase

such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect for a period of no less than six
years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations under such “tail” policy. If the Company
is unable to obtain the “tail” policy and Parent or the surviving corporation are unable to obtain the
insurance described above for an annual cost less than or equal to the maximum annual premium, Parent will
cause the surviving corporation to instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
aggregate annual premium equal to the maximum annual premium.",97,99

For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent agreed to provide each employee of the
Company or its subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues employment with Parent or any subsidiary of Parent (including the
surviving corporation) immediately following the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with (1) base
salary or wage rate and short-term cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (2) employee
benefits (excluding, in each case and for the avoidance of doubt, nonqualified deferred compensation,
severance, retention, change in control compensation or equity or equity-based plans or arrangements)that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect for (or available to) such Continuing Employee
under the Company’s employee plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the
twelve month period following the Effective Time, Parent agreed to cause the surviving corporation and its
respective subsidiaries to provide agreed upon severance benefits or compensation to eligible employees.
With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is made
available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each such plans, a “New Plan”), the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to, cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance determinations), except to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits for
the same period of service. In addition, Parent will or will cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) each Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding employee plan
(such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing life insurance, medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence
of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan be waived for the
Continuing Employees and their covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable, met or
waived under the comparable employee plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
or vision benefits, any eligible expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing
Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan begins, if such participation begins in the year in
which the Effective Time occurs, to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time, and will otherwise be subject to the terms of such vacation and/or paid time off
policies as determined by Parent and its affiliates from time to time (but in no event subject to forfeiture).
With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), for
the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) pay to each Continuing Employee who
remains employed with Parent, the surviving corporation or their respective affiliates through the end of
such fiscal year, at the same time or times that Parent, the surviving corporation or their applicable affiliate
pays annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other similarly situated employees thereof but in no

(ii) the Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee is entitled to receive under the applicable Company
Incentive Plan based on actual level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year
(as determined after giving appropriate effect to the Merger).
The Merger Agreement provides that the foregoing provisions under this “- Employee Benefits Matters”
section will not be deemed to: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of

Ping Identity Holding Corp._20220916_DEFM14A_20342713_4518798.Pdf,General,"General
Under the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of
your shares of Ping Identity common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with
interest, if any, as determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration you would otherwise be entitled to
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL described herein. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders electing to exercise
appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights.
Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.
This section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal
rights. The following discussion, however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal
rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is
accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/​
index.html#262 and incorporated by reference herein. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL to
“stockholder” are to the record holder of the shares of Ping Identity common stock immediately prior to the
Effective as to which appraisal rights are asserted. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The following discussion does not
constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Ping
Identity stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders of shares
of Ping Identity common stock who: (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares
to the Company prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the
Effective Time; and (4) otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger)
as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger Consideration. Any such Ping Identity stockholder
awarded “fair value” for the holder’s shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash,
together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Merger Consideration. It is possible that any
such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as,
that which Ping Identity stockholders will receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting to
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less
than 20 days before the Special Meeting. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with such
notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company’s stockholders of the availability of appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of
the applicable statutory provisions is accessible at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.
Stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the right to do so should review the
following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure to comply with the procedures of Section
262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Company unless certain stock ownership
conditions are satisfied by the Ping Identity stockholders seeking appraisal. Because of the complexity of the
procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to
consult with their own legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. A
Ping Identity stockholder who loses his, her, their or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration.

Ping Identity Holding Corp._20220916_DEFM14A_20342713_4518798.Pdf,How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights,"How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are a Ping Identity stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of
Ping Identity common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does
not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand
must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to
demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder’s failure to make a written demand for
appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal
rights;
You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet or by
telephone, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will
nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which does not contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
instruct the proxy to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
You must continuously hold your shares of Ping Identity common stock from the date of making the
demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares
before the Effective Time;
Any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (or any person
who is the beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held either in a voting trust or
by a nominee on behalf of such person and for which such record holder has complied with such
requirements) or the Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Company is
under no obligation to file any petition and has no present intention of doing so; and
You must otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL.
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Ping
Identity common stock.
In addition, because Ping Identity’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected
to continue to be listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Ping Identity common
stock, unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
Ping Identity common stock eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger
for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. We refer to conditions (1) and (2) as
the “ownership thresholds.” At least one of the ownership thresholds must be met in order for Company
stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Ping Identity common stock.
Voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing
to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as
required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from
any proxy or vote. However, you must not vote your shares via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by
proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in order to exercise your appraisal rights with
respect to such shares.",109,109
Ping Identity Holding Corp._20220916_DEFM14A_20342713_4518798.Pdf,Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights,"Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights
Only a holder of record of shares of Ping Identity common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time may assert appraisal rights for the shares of Ping Identity common stock registered
100 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record.
The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the stock
certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. Beneficial
owners may perfect appraisal rights if such beneficial owner (1) reasonably identifies in his, her or its
demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (2) provides documentary evidence
of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true
and correct copy of what it purports to be and (3) provides an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the Company and the office of Register in Chancery. A holder of record,
such as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds shares of Ping Identity common stock as a nominee or
intermediary for others, may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to the shares of Ping
Identity common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other
beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Ping Identity
common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Ping Identity common stock is
expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Ping Identity common stock held in
the name of the holder of record.
If you hold your shares in bank or brokerage accounts or other nominee forms, and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your bank, broker or nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to make a demand for appraisal of those shares. If
you have a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a nominee or
intermediary, you may perfect your appraisal rights by reasonably identifying your holder of record,
providing documentary evidence of such beneficial ownership attaching a statement that such documentary
evidence is true and providing an address where you consent to receive notices given by the Company and
the office of Register in Chancery. If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage who in turn holds the
shares through a central securities depository nominee, such as the Depository Trust Company, a demand
for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as the holder of record.
If you own shares of Ping Identity common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint
owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for
appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and
expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or
holders of record. If you hold shares of Ping Identity common stock through a nominee or intermediary who
in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for
appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as record holder.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written
demand to:

If the Merger is consummated, the surviving corporation will give written notice of the Effective Time within
ten days after the Effective Time to Ping Identity stockholders who did not vote in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and who made a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Company stockholder that made a demand for
appraisal but did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party will
have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the per share price in accordance with the Merger
Agreement for his, her or its shares of Ping Identity common stock, but after such 60-day period a demand
for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the surviving corporation. In addition, no
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as
101 TABLE OF CONTENTS
to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which approval may be
conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision
will not affect the right of any Ping Identity stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the
Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either a record
holder or a beneficial owner of Ping Identity common stock, provided such person has complied with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving
corporation must commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial
owner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Ping Identity common stock held by all
stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to
file an appraisal petition and has no present intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares
appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the
time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written
request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Ping Identity common stock not voted
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Ping Identity has received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The surviving corporation must
mail this statement to you within the later of (1) ten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the
request therefor or (2) ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are
the beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or
intermediary on your behalf, you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the
surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Ping Identity
common stock who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide
the Delaware Court of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders
who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares
have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine
which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal
who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery
will also dismiss proceedings as to all Ping Identity stockholders if neither of the ownership thresholds
described above is met. Where proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not
successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Ping Identity
common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will
thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of Ping Identity common stock at the Effective Time held by
all Ping Identity stockholders who have properly perfected appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving
corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the
proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder entitled to appraisal. If the surviving
corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL, interest
will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving
corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary cash payment before such
payment was made, unless such interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is
102 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
made. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value,
less any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders
of Ping Identity entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon
surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
factors which were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of
value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court
construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of
speculation, may be considered.”
You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Ping Identity common stock as determined under
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to
receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and
does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Moreover, neither Ping Identity nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share price to any Ping
Identity stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for
purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Ping Identity common stock is less than the per share
price. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of such shares, then all Ping Identity stockholders will lose
the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the per share price described in the Merger Agreement,
without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those
costs to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances.
Each Ping Identity stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for its own attorneys’ fees
and expert witnesses’ fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Ping Identity common stock entitled to
appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and award pursuant to a
reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after
the Effective Time, vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other
distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Ping
Identity common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may
withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the per share price by delivering a written withdrawal of
103 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger to the surviving corporation, except that any
attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the
surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as
to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be
conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision
will not affect the right of any Ping Identity stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the
Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for
appraisal, or lose the appraisal right, your shares of Ping Identity common stock will be converted into the
right to receive the per share price, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in
the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your
shares of Ping Identity common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement without interest. In view of
the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Ping Identity stockholder and are
considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and
financial advisor.
The process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of Section 262
of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own legal and financial
advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there are any inconsistencies
between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.

If the Merger is completed, we do not expect to hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, as Ping Identity
will cease to be an independent public company and will become a subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is not
completed, you will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in the Company’s annual meetings of
stockholders, and we will hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, in which case we will provide notice of
or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2023 annual meeting will be held. If the 2023 annual
meeting of stockholders is held, stockholder proposals will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the
proxy statement and form of proxy for the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders in accordance

Our Amended and Restated Bylaws set forth procedures to be followed by stockholders who wish to
nominate candidates for election to the Ping Identity Board in connection with annual meetings of
stockholders or who wish to bring forth other business at the annual meeting of stockholders. All such
nominations must be accompanied by certain background and other information specified in our Amended
and Restated Bylaws. A stockholder wishing to nominate a director for the 2023 annual meeting of
stockholders or bring forth other business must have provided written notice to the Secretary of their
intention to make such nomination no earlier than January 3, 2023, and no later than February 2, 2023. To
comply with the universal proxy rules (once effective), shareholders who intend to solicit proxies in support
of director nominees, other than the Company’s nominees, must provide notice that sets forth the
information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than March 4, 2023.

Board of Directors 
Ping Identity Holding Corp. 
1001 17th Street, Suite 100 
Denver, CO 80202
Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than
Project Polaris Holdings, LP (“Parent”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”), of Ping Identity Holding Corp. (the “Company”) of the $28.50 in cash
per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 2,
2022 (the “Agreement”), by and among Parent, Project Polaris Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Company.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal
investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial
activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests
or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and
investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other
financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including
Vista Equity Partners LLC (“Vista”), an affiliate of a significant equityholder of the Company, and Thoma
Bravo, L.P. (“Thoma Bravo”), an affiliate of a significant equityholder of Parent, and any of their respective
affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the
Company in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction.
We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the principal portion of which
is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of
our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We
have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates
from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation.
We have also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Vista and/or its affiliates
and portfolio companies from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may
receive, compensation, including having acted as left lead bookrunner with respect to a follow-on offering of
JAMF Holding Corp. (“JAMF”), a portfolio company of Vista, of 11,000,000 shares of its common stock in
November 2020; and as lead left bookrunner with respect to the initial public offering of PowerSchool
Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of Vista, of 39,473,685 shares of its Class A common stock in July 2021.
We have also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Thoma Bravo and/or its
affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received,
and may receive, compensation, including having acted as bookrunner with respect to the initial public
offering of McAfee Corp. (“McAfee”), a portfolio company of Thoma Bravo, of 23,000,000 shares of its Class
A common stock in October 2020; as financial advisor to Thoma Bravo with respect to its acquisition of
RealPage, Inc. in December 2020; as bookrunner with respect to the initial public offering by Thoma Bravo
Advantage, an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, of 100,000,000 units in January 2021; as financial advisor to McAfee
in the sale of certain assets of its enterprise

business in March 2021; as financial advisor to Thoma Bravo LLC, an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, with respect
to its acquisition of Proofpoint, Inc. in August 2021; and as financial advisor to McAfee with respect to its
sale in November 2021. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to
the Company, Parent, Vista, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio
companies for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman
Sachs also may have co-invested with Vista, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates from time to time
and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Thoma Bravo and Vista from time to time
and may do so in the future.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; the annual reports
to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the three fiscal years ended December
31, 2021; the registration statement on Form S-1 of the Company, dated August 23, 2019, as amended,
including the prospectus contained therein, relating to the registration and resale of Company Common
Stock; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain
other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst
reports for the Company; certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its
management as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”); including certain analyses prepared
by the management of the Company related to the expected utilization by the Company of certain net
operating loss carryforwards and R&D credit carryforwards of the Company, as approved for our use by the
company (the “Tax Attributes Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with the members of senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations,
financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for
certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain
recent business combinations in the software industry and in other industries; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,
discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof.
In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts and the Tax Attributes Forecasts have

the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by
the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including the fairness of the

payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used

transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii)

product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
A-19 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Stock represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share Price, and the Certificates so surrendered
will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record
holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the
“Uncertificated Shares”) will be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.7 with respect of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, such record holder, upon receipt
of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request), will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by (2) the Per Share
Price, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon
the surrender of such Certificates and transfer of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c).
Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that
the Payment Agent shall transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting such exchange
present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
(f) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.
(g) Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by Parent) upon
demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to
this Section 2.9 shall thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), as general creditors thereof, for any claim to
the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares five years after the
Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously
entitled thereto.

rights to such equity interests would reasonably be expected to (a) delay in any material respect the
obtaining of, or increase in any material respect the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period, (b) increase in any material respect the risk of any Governmental
Authority seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, or (c)

aggregate amount of the Equity Financing; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Equity Financing; (iii) have the
effect of preventing, materially impeding, materially delaying or otherwise materially adversely affecting

Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability and
similar insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are
equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c),
the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 400% of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 400% amount, the “Maximum Annual
Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. In satisfaction
of the foregoing obligations, prior to the Effective Time the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail”
policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost
for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase
such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect for a period of no less
than six years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If the Company
is unable to obtain the “tail” policy and Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the
insurance described in this Section 6.10(c) for an annual cost less than or equal to the Maximum Annual
Premium, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to instead obtain as much comparable insurance
as possible for an aggregate annual premium equal to the Maximum Annual Premium.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving
Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person
who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c)
(and their heirs and representatives), the “Other Indemnified Persons”) without the prior written consent
of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or Other
Indemnified Persons are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of
enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons and Other Indemnified Persons
pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such
Persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the Organizational Documents of the
Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or
impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy
or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.
6.11 Employee Matters.
(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control”  (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective
Time.
(b) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) assume and honor all of the Employee Plans in
A-53 TABLE OF CONTENTS

herein shall limit the Surviving Corporation’s ability to terminate or amend such Employee Plans in
accordance with their terms.
(c) Employment; Benefits. For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (the
“Continuation Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (i)
base salary or wage rate and short-term cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time; and
(ii) employee benefits (excluding, in each case and for the avoidance of doubt, nonqualified deferred
compensation, severance, retention, change in control compensation or equity or equity-based plans or
arrangements) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect for (or available to) such
Continuing Employee under the Employee Plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the
Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) provide severance benefits or compensation to eligible employees as set forth in Section 6.11(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.
(d) New Plans. With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or
agreement that is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each such
plans, a “New Plan”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit
for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance determinations), except to the extent that it
would result in duplication of coverage or benefits for the same period of service. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) each Continuing Employee will
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding Employee
Plan (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing life insurance, medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such
New Plan be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable, met or waived under the comparable Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, any eligible expenses incurred
by the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins, if such participation begins in the year in which the Effective Time occurs, to be given full credit
pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employees and their covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Any vacation
or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and will otherwise be
subject to the terms of such vacation and/or paid time off policies as determined by Parent and its
Affiliates from time to time (but in no event subject to forfeiture).
(e) Company Incentive Plans. With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans as set
forth in Section 6.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), for the
fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) pay to each Continuing Employee
who remains employed with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries through
the end of such fiscal year, at the same time or times that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
applicable Subsidiary pays annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other similarly situated
employees thereof, but in no event later than March 15 immediately after the end of such fiscal year, a
bonus for such fiscal year (the “Annual Bonus”) that is equal to the greater of (i) the target Annual
Bonus that such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not
the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(e), Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use,
real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case, arising out of or in connection with
entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to (x) Section 8.1(c) (provided that, at the
Termination Date, all of the conditions set forth in Article VII, other than the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(a), have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, so long as such conditions are at the time of termination capable of
being satisfied as if such time were the Closing)), (y) Section 8.1(d) or (z) Section 8.1(e); (B)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this
Agreement, any Person shall have publicly announced or the Company shall have publicly
disclosed an Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn or
otherwise abandoned prior to such termination; and (C) within twelve months following such
termination of this Agreement, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company
enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction
and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within three Business Days) after such consummation pay to Parent the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to
“20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”
(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must
promptly (and in any event within three Business Days) following such termination pay to
A-60 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent.
(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must prior
to or substantially concurrently with such termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent.
(c) Expense Amount. If this Agreement is validly terminated and the Company Termination Fee is
payable by the Company to Parent in accordance with the terms hereof, then in addition to the Company
Termination Fee, the Company shall also pay, or cause to be paid to Parent, an amount (the “Expense
Amount”) equal to the sum of all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid or payable by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
which Expense Amount shall not exceed $1,500,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent within five Business Days after the date of such
termination.
(d) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee and the Expense Amount on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Company Termination Fee and the Expense Amount may be payable pursuant to
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events.
(e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are
an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the Company Termination Fee and the Expense Amount are not a
penalty, but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such amounts are payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or (c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3 or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent Parent’s reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding,
together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made
through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, the “Enforcement Expenses”), which Enforcement
Expenses shall not exceed $5,000,000.

(i) Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement, the Guarantee
or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $188,500,000 plus the Reimbursement
Obligations in the aggregate for all such breaches (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). In no event will
the Company be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award in excess of
the Parent Liability Limitation against (A) Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor; and (B) the former,
current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, agents and
attorneys, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor), Representatives, members,

Related Parties hereunder.

extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3, or Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section
9.8, as applicable, will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and Merger Sub and each of

Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
