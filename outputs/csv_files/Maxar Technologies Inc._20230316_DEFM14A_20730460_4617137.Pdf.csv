On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will merge
with and into Maxar (which we refer to as the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will

will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE and the TSX. In addition, Maxar common
stock will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the
“Exchange Act”), and Maxar will no longer file periodic or other reports with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”) or applicable Canadian securities regulators. If the
Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, subject to
your appraisal rights (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger

the Merger Consideration (and for SARs, less the exercise price per share of Maxar common stock subject to
such SAR) (which we refer to as the “Cash Amount”), less any required tax withholding and deductions. For
purposes of clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of common stock subject
to a Maxar PSU will equal (i) for a PSU granted in 2020, 175% of the target number of shares of Maxar

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 68)
The exchange of Maxar common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) who exchanges shares of Maxar common stock for cash in the Merger
generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash

the Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state,

treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the
particular tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Appraisal Rights (see page 62)
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Maxar stockholders who continuously
hold shares of Maxar common stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection
3 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Maxar stockholders may be entitled to have
their shares of Maxar common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in
cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Maxar common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (or in certain
circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to
be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each Maxar stockholder
entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, Maxar stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Maxar stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of
their shares of Maxar common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Maxar stockholders must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to
Maxar before the vote of Maxar stockholders is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (b)
not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to
hold shares of Maxar common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all
other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Maxar unless certain stock ownership conditions
are satisfied by the Maxar stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal
rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262
of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL
is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Maxar common stock through a
bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,
broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on
your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights.”",12,13

In connection with the Merger Agreement, several complaints have been filed in federal court as
individual actions. The complaints are captioned as follows: (1) O’Dell v. Maxar Technologies Inc., et al., 23-
cv-00929 (filed February 3, 2023 in the Southern District of New York); (2) Johnson v. Maxar Technologies
Inc., et al., 23-cv-00383 (filed February 9, 2023 in the District of Colorado); (3) Zaczkiewicz v. Maxar
Technologies Inc., et al., 23-cv-00401 (filed February 10, 2023 in the District of Colorado); and (4) Jeweltex
Manufacturing Retirement Plan v. Maxar Technologies Inc., et al., 23-cv-00873 (filed February 27, 2023 in
the Northern District of California) (which we refer to collectively as the “Complaints”).
The Complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Maxar on January 31, 2023
in connection with Merger Agreement (the “Preliminary Proxy”) misrepresents and/or omits certain
purportedly material information. The Complaints assert violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against Maxar and the members of the Board of
Directors. The Complaints seek, among other things: (i) an injunction enjoining the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) rescission or rescissory
damages in the event the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are
consummated; (iii) direction that the defendants comply with the Exchange Act and disseminate a revised
Preliminary Proxy; (iv) direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a result of any
misconduct; (v) costs of the action, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees; and (vi) other relief
the court may deem just and proper. In addition to the Complaints, starting on February 6, 2023, purported
stockholders of Maxar sent demand letters (which we refer to as the “Demands,” and together with the
Complaints, as the “Matters”) alleging similar deficiencies regarding the disclosures made in the Preliminary
4 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Proxy. One such letter additionally seeks corporate books and records in order to investigate alleged
wrongdoing by Maxar’s Board of Directors, Maxar’s executive officers and/or Maxar’s financial advisors in
connection with the Merger Agreement.
Maxar cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. Maxar management believes that the Matters are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent demands or filed
actions. If additional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different
allegations, Maxar will not necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.",13,14

Financing”) to be provided by the preferred equity investor parties (which we refer to as the “Preferred
Equity Investor Parties”) to the preferred equity commitment letter, dated December 15, 2022 (as amended,

accordance with the Merger Agreement, which we refer to as the “Preferred Equity Commitment Letter” and,
together with the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter, which we refer to as the
“Financing Commitments”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter.
In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to Maxar copies of the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letters, and Preferred Equity Issuer has delivered to
Maxar a copy of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter. Such amounts will be used to fund the aggregate
purchase price required to be paid at the Closing (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Closing and Effective Time”), and to also fund certain
other payments (including the Required Amounts), subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement.
The Equity Financing Sources have committed to capitalize Parent at the Closing with an aggregate
equity contribution equal to approximately $4.1 billion for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts
(which we refer to as the “Equity Contribution”). Maxar is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity
Commitment Letters solely with respect to (i) requiring Maxar’s consent to any amendment or modification of
the Equity Commitment Letters and (ii) the rights granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letters,
such that Maxar is entitled to specifically enforce the obligations of each Equity Financing Source (and any
of their respective successors or assigns) under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter through an action
for specific performance, in each case without a requirement that such enforcement be at the direction of
Parent and subject to (a) the limitations and conditions set forth in each Equity Commitment Letter and (b)
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
The Equity Financing Sources have entered into that certain Limited Guarantee, dated as of December
15, 2022 (which we refer to as the “Guarantee”), whereby they have agreed to severally (but not jointly, or
jointly and severally) guarantee the due, punctual and complete payment, performance and discharge of
either of the following mutually exclusive obligations: (a) the obligation of Parent to pay, or to provide
adequate funds for the payment to Maxar of, (1) certain indemnification and reimbursement obligations
solely if and when payable by Parent to Maxar and its representatives in connection with arrangement of the
Debt Financing and certain other fees and expenses payable by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
plus (2) an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee (plus certain enforcement expenses payable by
Parent), solely if and when any of the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
or (b) the obligation of Parent to fund an amount equal to the Equity Contribution in the event, and only in
the event, that specific performance with respect to Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded by Parent and to consummate the Closing is awarded against Parent pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, subject in all respects to the terms of the Merger Agreement. We refer to the obligations set
forth in the preceding sentence as the “Guaranteed Obligations.” Notwithstanding anything in the
Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement to the contrary, Maxar has agreed that in no event
is any Equity Financing Source required to pay any amount to Maxar or any affiliate thereof under, in respect
of, or in connection with the Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement, in excess of, in the
case of amounts paid with respect to clause (a) of the Guaranteed Obligations, the pro rata portion of such
Equity Financing Source with respect to such amounts and with respect to clause (b) of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the pro rata portion of such Equity Financing Source of the Equity Contribution.
In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, (a) the Lender Parties have committed to provide
Parent with Debt Financing, and (b) Parent has obtained commitments for Preferred Equity

Financing, to pay the Required Amounts. The obligations of the Lender Parties to provide Debt Financing

number of customary conditions, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger. For

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 26, 2022, Maxar retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
(which we refer to as “J.P. Morgan”) as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Board of Directors on December 15, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to
the Board of Directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in the
proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its
December 15, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board of Directors, dated December
15, 2022, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in
the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated December 15, 2022, which sets forth, among
other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P.
Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such

addressed to the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its
evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did
not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the
consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Maxar or as
to the underlying decision by Maxar to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any Maxar stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the
proposed Merger or any other matter.

Commencing on December 15, 2022 and continuing until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 14,
2023 (which we refer to as the “Go-Shop Period”), Maxar and its directors, officers, employees and other
representatives had the right to, directly or indirectly, and subject to certain limitations: solicit or initiate
Acquisition Proposals (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - 
Go-Shop Period”); provide non-public information relating to Maxar and its subsidiaries to third parties,
solely pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Go-Shop Period”) and so long as Parent was given
9 TABLE OF CONTENTS
access to the same information; and otherwise cooperate with or assist any Acquisition Proposal, including
by granting a waiver under any “standstill provision” or similar obligation of third parties to allow such
parties to submit or amend an Acquisition Proposal on a confidential basis to the Board of Directors.
After the end of the Go-Shop Period (or, in the case of an Excluded Party, as defined in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - No Shop Period,” once such party is no longer an
Excluded Party), Maxar has agreed to, and to cause its officers to, and to instruct and use reasonable efforts
to cause its directors and other representatives to, promptly cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any third party or its representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal)
and to promptly terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
person, cease providing any further non-public information of Maxar or its subsidiaries to any such person
and request the return or destruction of any non-public information of Maxar or its subsidiaries theretofore
furnished to any such person (with whom a confidentiality agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or any other proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal was
entered into at any time within the immediately preceding 12-month period).
Also after the end of the Go-Shop Period, other than with respect to Excluded Parties so long as they
remain Excluded Parties, Maxar has agreed not to, and to cause its officers not to, and to instruct and use
reasonable efforts to cause its directors and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, among other
things: solicit or initiate Acquisition Proposals; provide non-public information relating to Maxar and its
subsidiaries to third parties in furtherance of Acquisition Proposals; enter into discussions or negotiations
with third parties regarding Acquisition Proposals; adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
approve any person or “group”  (as defined in the Exchange Act) becoming an “interested stockholder”
under Section 203 of the DGCL; and, except for Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements, enter into any
agreements that provide for an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction (as defined in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Go-Shop Period”).
During the No Shop Period (which is the period of time following the Go-Shop Period), Maxar has also
agreed to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate, fail to enforce or otherwise modify any
provision of any standstill, confidentiality or other similar agreement that prohibits or purports to prohibit a
proposal being made to the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), unless the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable laws and Maxar provides notice to Parent
of such determination within 24 hours.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, under certain specified circumstances, until the adoption of
the Merger Agreement by Maxar stockholders, Maxar may, among other things, provide information to, and
engage in discussions or negotiations with, a person in respect of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if,
subject to complying with certain procedures, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes (or could reasonably be expected to lead to) a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - No Shop Period”).
Additionally, following the Go-Shop Period Maxar has agreed to, subject to certain requirements and
procedures, promptly notify Parent of any Acquisition Proposal received by Maxar before or after the end of
the Go-Shop Period, including identifying the material terms and conditions of such proposals and the
parties making such proposals and providing copies of material documents and other material written
materials submitted with such proposals. Maxar has also agreed to provide updates on the status of such
proposals when requested by Parent, subject to certain conditions.

Go-Shop Period” and “The Merger Agreement - No Shop Period.”

to change its recommendation regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and/or to terminate the Merger
Agreement, as applicable, for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal or
in light of an Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled

complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including giving Parent appropriate notice of

determines in good faith, after having consulted with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy

The termination of the Merger Agreement by Maxar in connection with the Board of Directors’
authorization for Maxar to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction
contemplated by a Superior Proposal will result in the payment by Maxar of a termination fee of $124.5 million
if done after the Go-Shop Period ends (and it would have resulted in the payment of a termination fee of
$51.9 million if done before the Go-Shop Period ended at 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 14, 2023).

What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $53.00 in
cash, without interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of Maxar common stock
that you own (other than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you
have properly and validly exercised (and do not withdraw) your appraisal rights in accordance with, and
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Maxar common stock,
you will receive $5,300 in cash in exchange for your shares of Maxar common stock (other than any
Unconverted Shares), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Unconverted Shares
means (a) certain shares of Maxar common stock held in the treasury of Maxar or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiaries of Maxar (in each case, other than
any such shares of Maxar common stock held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf
of third parties), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) shares of Maxar common
stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have properly
and validly exercised (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights in accordance with, and who have complied
with, Section 262 of the DGCL. If you are the holder of any outstanding Maxar RSUs, 2023 Employee
RSUs, PSUs, DSUs or SARs immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether the award is vested or
unvested, your award will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive a cash amount equal to
the product of (x) the total number of shares of Maxar common stock subject to the award and (y) the
Merger Consideration (and for SARs, less the exercise price per share of Maxar common stock subject
to such SAR) (which we refer to as the “Cash Amount”), less any required tax withholding and
deductions. For purposes of clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of
common stock subject to a Maxar PSU will equal (i) for a PSU granted in 2020, 175% of the target number
of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU, (ii) for a PSU granted in 2021, 176% of the
target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU, and (iii) for a PSU granted in
2022, 184% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU. The payment
of the Cash Amount in consideration of 33% of the number of shares of Maxar common stock covered
by a 2023 Employee RSU will be made no later than 10 business days following the Closing Date, and
the payment of the Cash Amount in consideration of 67% of the number of shares of Maxar common
stock covered by a 2023 Employee RSU will be paid in two substantially equal installments on each of

date; provided that, if such holder experiences a termination without cause or for good reason, any
unpaid amount will be paid to the holder within 30 days of such termination.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
The exchange of Maxar common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder who exchanges shares of Maxar common
stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of Maxar common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such
U.S. Holder.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address
state, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to
special treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to
determine the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger.
What will I receive for my SARs, RSUs, PSUs, or DSUs, as applicable, in the Merger?
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time:
RSUs, 2023 Employee RSUs, PSUs, DSUs and SARs that are outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Cash Amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Maxar common
stock subject to such award and (y) the Merger Consideration (and for SARs, less the exercise price
per share of Maxar common stock subject to such SAR), less any required tax withholding and
deductions. For purposes of clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares
of common stock subject to a PSU will equal (i) for a PSU granted in 2020, 175% of the target number
of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU, (ii) for a PSU granted in 2021, 176% of the
target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU, and (iii) for a PSU granted in
2022, 184% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU.
Payment of the Cash Amount in consideration of 67% of the number of shares of Maxar common
stock covered by a 2023 Employee RSU will be paid in two substantially equal installments on each of
January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, subject to the holder’s continued employment with Maxar, the
Surviving Corporation, or a subsidiary through the applicable payment date (or earlier termination of
employment without cause or for good reason), and payment of the Cash Amount in consideration of
33% of the number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by a 2023 Employee RSU will be paid
no later than 10 business days following the Closing Date.
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal?
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock
entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders
of the shares of Maxar common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or
by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the
Compensation Proposal is required to approve the Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of the
holders of the shares of Maxar common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in
person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Maxar stockholder of record to: (a)
submit a signed proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the
instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting at the
Special Meeting”); or (c) attend the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a

quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how
to vote your shares (resulting in “broker non-votes”) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, the
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark
the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed
proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3)
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
What constitutes a quorum?
The holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote present in
person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special
Meeting. Because there were 75,549,337 shares of Maxar common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
as of the Record Date, we will need holders of at least 37,774,669 shares present in person, or by remote
communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Maxar stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, Maxar stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Maxar common stock.
Instead, Maxar will remain an independent public company, Maxar common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the NYSE and the TSX and registered under the Exchange Act, and Maxar will
continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC and applicable Canadian securities regulators.
Under specified circumstances, Maxar will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $124.5 million,
upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees.”
Why are Maxar stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Maxar to seek an advisory (nonbinding)
vote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.
What will happen if Maxar stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote
with respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Maxar.
Therefore, if the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed,
the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Maxar’s named
executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
What do I need to do now?
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy
statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how
it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your shares can be voted at the Special
Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Should I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?
No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures”) will send each holder of record
of an outstanding certificate a letter of transmittal and instructions that explain how to exchange shares
of Maxar common stock represented by such holder’s certificates for the Merger Consideration. Also
after the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will send each holder of uncertificated shares
represented by book entry the Merger Consideration for each such book-entry share upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request).
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Maxar common stock after the Record Date but before
the Special Meeting?
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the
Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Maxar common stock after the
Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy)
are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of
you notifies Maxar in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your
shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares of Maxar common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to
sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your
proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in
the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”).
What is the difference between holding shares as a Maxar stockholder of record and holding shares in “street
name” as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are
considered to be the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Maxar.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of shares of Maxar common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has
been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those
shares, to be the Maxar stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You
are also invited to attend the virtual Special Meeting.
How may I vote?
If you are a Maxar stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Maxar common stock are registered in
your name with Computershare, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
Internet: Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system
is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 18, 2023. Once you enter the Internet
voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
Telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is
available 24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 18, 2023. Once you
enter the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or
change) your voting instructions.
Mail: Mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-paid
envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. on
April 18, 2023.
At the Special Meeting: Shares held directly in your name as a Maxar stockholder of record may be
voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be

voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from
your bank, broker or other nominee.
If your shares of Maxar common stock are held “in street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee, the
holder of your shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form
and directions on how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the
Internet or by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy
to ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both
of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still
attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over
the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on
your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for
which you will be responsible.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through
your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is a Maxar stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such
Maxar stockholder on their behalf. If you are a Maxar stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over
the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card.
If you hold shares beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by
your bank, broker or other nominee.
If a Maxar stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or
your proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or
telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before
the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be
voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal.
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this
proxy statement. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by
any of the following actions:
Notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing at 1300 West 120th Avenue, Westminster, Colorado

Signing and returning a later dated proxy card;
Submitting a new proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone; or
Voting virtually at the Special Meeting. Please note that virtual attendance at the Special Meeting will
not by itself constitute revocation of a proxy.
Any change to your proxy that is provided by telephone or the Internet must be submitted by 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on April 18, 2023.
If you hold your shares of Maxar common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker
or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special
Meeting via the Special Meeting website.
If you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy

What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
This means you own shares of Maxar common stock that are registered under different names or are in
more than one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a Maxar stockholder of
record and other shares through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In
these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of
the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy
cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes
with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy
card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with
another Maxar stockholder?
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more Maxar stockholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single proxy statement to those Maxar stockholders. This process, which is
commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for Maxar
stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Maxar and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy
materials to multiple Maxar stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary
instructions have been received from the affected Maxar stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish
to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your
household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future
deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage
account or Maxar if you are a Maxar stockholder of record by making a request to our Corporate
Secretary at 1300 West 120th Avenue, Westminster, Colorado 80234 or by calling our proxy solicitor,
Georgeson LLC, at (888) 613-9817. In addition, Maxar will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request
to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special
Meeting. In addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Maxar
will file the final voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been
certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
Maxar has engaged Georgeson LLC, which we refer to as “Georgeson,” to assist in the solicitation of
proxies for the Special Meeting. Maxar estimates that it will pay Georgeson a fee of approximately
$20,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Maxar has agreed to indemnify
Georgeson against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies
(subject to certain exceptions).
Maxar also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their
respective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Maxar
common stock. Maxar directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by
electronic means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
We currently expect to complete the Merger in mid-2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the
Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.
How can I obtain additional information about Maxar?
Maxar will provide copies of this proxy statement and any documents incorporated by reference herein
(not including exhibits to the documents that are incorporated by reference unless such exhibits are
specifically incorporated by reference into such documents) without charge to any Maxar stockholder
who makes a request to our Corporate Secretary in writing at 1300 West 120th Avenue, Westminster,
Colorado 80234 or by telephone at (303) 684-7660. The requested documents will be provided by first
class mail or other similarly prompt means. Maxar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022 and other SEC filings may also be accessed at https://sec.gov or on Maxar’s
Investor website at http://investor.maxar.com. Maxar’s website address is provided as an inactive

proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to our

stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly
demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek
appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL. This means that Maxar stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw
their demand for appraisal, and follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL
may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in
cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Maxar common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain
circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to
be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each Maxar stockholder
entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, Maxar stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review
Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.
Maxar stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to Maxar before
the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor
of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your shares of Maxar common stock

As part of Maxar’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the
Board of Directors and Maxar’s management periodically review, consider and assess Maxar’s operations
and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals
and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for

combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, as compared to the benefits and
risks of continued operation as a standalone company, and have sometimes included outside financial and
legal advisors.
On May 16, 2022, a representative of Advent contacted General Howell M. Estes, III, Chairman of the
Board of Directors, regarding Advent’s potential interest in Maxar. Later that day, representatives of Advent
emailed Daniel L. Jablonsky, Maxar’s Chief Executive Officer and indicated that representatives of Advent
would be in Colorado later that month and that they would like to meet with Mr. Jablonsky and other
members of Maxar’s management to discuss their view of Maxar’s future business prospects and other
potential opportunities. Following such communication, Maxar’s then-Chief Strategy Officer (the “CSO”)
agreed to meet by videoconference with representatives of Advent to discuss such matters.
On May 26, 2022, representatives of Advent met with the CSO by videoconference and provided
background information with respect to Advent and defense and aerospace companies in which Advent had
invested or that Advent had acquired, including Cobham Limited and Ultra Electronics. Representatives of
Advent explained that they believed that Maxar was well positioned for future success and that Advent was
confident in Maxar’s future business prospects. The substance of this meeting was relayed by the CSO to
Mr. Jablonsky and other members of Maxar’s management team.
On May 27, 2022, representatives of Advent sent an email to Mr. Jablonsky stating that they had
enjoyed their meeting with Maxar, and that they would like to open up a dialogue between Advent and Maxar
about ways in which Advent might be helpful to Maxar in the future. They also requested a follow up
meeting with Maxar in which Mr. Jablonsky would participate. In this email, representatives of Advent did
not provide a specific agenda or proposal with respect to which they intended to discuss or propose during
such a meeting, and Mr. Jablonsky did not schedule a meeting with Advent following the May 27, 2022 email.
On June 15, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the “June 15 Letter”),
addressed to Mr. Jablonsky and General Estes. The June 15 Letter contained a nonbinding indication of
interest for Advent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock at a value of $48 per
share in cash. The June 15 Letter noted, among other things, that Advent’s proposal was subject to the
satisfactory completion of confirmatory due diligence (supplementary to Advent’s already-completed
outside-in diligence) as well as the negotiation and execution of a merger agreement and other related
documentation, and attached as an exhibit a due diligence request list. The June 15 Letter also noted that the
transaction would not be subject to a financing condition. Promptly following receipt of the June 15 Letter,
Mr. Jablonsky shared it with the Board of Directors.
On June 17, 2022, Mr. Jablonsky emailed representatives of Advent a letter confirming receipt of the
June 15 Letter, stating that the June 15 Letter had been shared with the Board of Directors, and that the
Board of Directors would review the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter carefully, with the assistance of
Maxar’s financial and legal advisors. Mr. Jablonsky’s letter stated that he would respond to the proposal in
the June 15 Letter after the Board of Directors had the opportunity to review and consider the proposal.
Following receipt of the June 15 Letter, based upon discussions with General Estes and other
independent directors, Mr. Jablonsky and Maxar’s management determined that it would be advisable for
Maxar to retain a financial advisor to aid Maxar’s management and the Board of Directors in evaluating the
proposal contained in the June 15 Letter. Between June 15, 2022 and July 28, 2022, members of Maxar’s
management met with several candidates, and determined to explore retaining J.P. Morgan as financial
advisor to Maxar in connection with its consideration of the June 15 Letter. J.P. Morgan was selected based
on its qualifications, expertise and reputation in the aerospace and defense sectors, and its knowledge of the
business and affairs of Maxar.
On July 6, 2022, representatives of Advent contacted members of Maxar’s management team to inquire
about a response to the June 15 Letter. On July 8, 2022, members of Maxar’s management team reiterated the
sentiments expressed in Mr. Jablonsky’s June 17, 2022 letter: that Maxar would respond to the June 15 Letter
once the Board of Directors had carefully reviewed and considered the proposal contained therein.
On July 28, 2022, the Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled, in-person meeting in Westminster,
Colorado, during which members of Maxar’s management, representatives of Maxar’s financial advisor,
30 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
J.P. Morgan, and representatives of Maxar’s legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell
Lipton”) participated. Additionally, representatives of Milbank LLP (“Milbank”), regulatory counsel to
Maxar, participated in the meeting telephonically. At the meeting, Mr. Jablonsky described Maxar’s contacts
with Advent, including the May 26, 2022 meeting and the June 15 Letter and the proposal contained therein.
A representative of Wachtell Lipton provided an overview of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under
Delaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Maxar. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan provided an overview of the current market landscape based on publicly available information and
Maxar’s historical performance based on publicly available information and information provided by Maxar’s
management. Additionally, representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board of Directors J.P. Morgan’s
preliminary financial analysis of the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter, based on the July 2022 Base
Case Forecast. The representatives of J.P. Morgan also discussed various precedent transactions, including
recent leveraged buyout transactions by private equity sponsors, the state of the U.S. leveraged financing
market and the difficulties facing that market at that time, and addressed the potential impact such difficulties
could have on Advent’s ability to obtain financing in connection with a potential transaction, and other
public market considerations. Additionally, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Milbank reviewed the
likely regulatory approvals that would be required to consummate a transaction with Advent, as well as the
feasibility and likely timing of such approvals.
Following the presentations by Maxar’s advisors, the Board of Directors discussed the June 15 Letter
and how best to proceed with respect to the proposal contained therein. In particular, the Board of Directors
discussed (i) the possibility that undertaking any potential transaction could result in significant distraction
and diversion of management’s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar’s strategic priorities,
including the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program, (ii) the state of the U.S. leveraged
financing market and whether the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter was likely to be actionable in light
of the then-current market conditions, (iii) the likelihood that Advent and its potential financing sources
would agree to be required to complete any potential transaction in the event that the WorldView Legion
program was not successful, and the significant negative impact on Maxar and its stockholders that would
likely arise from a failed transaction, and (iv) the valuation of Maxar that could be achieved upon the
successful execution of Maxar’s business plan relative to the consideration proposed in the June 15 Letter,
including risks related to Maxar’s ability to execute successfully on its business plan and the likely impact
that certain adverse changes to the business plan would have. In light of these and other considerations
discussed among members of the Board of Directors and Maxar’s management, the Board of Directors
unanimously determined that further engagement with Advent with respect to Advent’s June 15 Letter was
not warranted at the time. The Board of Directors directed members of Maxar’s management to inform Advent
of the Board of Directors’ decision.
Additionally, following the July 28, 2022 meeting, the Board of Directors determined that Maxar should
retain J.P. Morgan as Maxar’s financial advisor in connection with Maxar’s consideration of Advent’s
proposal and related matters.
On August 1, 2022, Mr. Jablonsky emailed a letter (the “August 1 Letter”) to representatives of Advent
that responded to the June 15 Letter. The August 1 Letter stated that the Board of Directors had carefully
reviewed and considered the June 15 Letter, with the assistance of Maxar’s financial and legal advisors, and
had unanimously determined that the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter did not provide a basis for
further discussions at that time, and that the Board of Directors believed that it was in the best interest of
Maxar and its stockholders for the company to remain focused on the execution of its business plan and, in
particular, the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program.
On August 22, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the “August 22 Letter”)
addressed to Mr. Jablonsky and General Estes. The August 22 Letter contained an updated nonbinding
proposal for Advent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock at a value of $50 per
share in cash. Additionally, the August 22 Letter reiterated Advent’s request for additional confirmatory due
diligence information, stating if Advent were allowed access to certain due diligence information, Advent
could be in a position to either reaffirm or increase the value of its proposal. Promptly following receipt of
the August 22 Letter, Mr. Jablonsky shared it with the Board of Directors. Mr. Jablonsky also confirmed to
representatives of Advent that he had received the August 22 Letter.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 29, 2022, representatives of Advent sent an email to Mr. Jablonsky to inquire as to the status
of Maxar’s response to the August 22 Letter and request an in person meeting in the coming weeks with Mr.
Jablonsky.
Mr. Jablonsky discussed the August 22 Letter and Advent’s August 29, 2022 email with General Estes
and other members of the Board of Directors, as well as members of Maxar management and representatives
of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton. These conversations included discussions of the reasons why the
Board of Directors had instructed Mr. Jablonsky to inform Advent following the Board of Directors’ July 28,
2022 meeting that the June 15 Letter did not warrant further discussion, including, in particular, the
possibility that undertaking any potential transaction process could result in significant distraction and
diversion of management’s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar’s strategic priorities, including
the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program and the likelihood that Advent and its potential
financing sources would agree to complete any potential transaction in the event that the WorldView Legion
program was not successful, and the significant negative impact on Maxar and its stockholders that would
likely arise from a failed transaction. During these conversations and others, it was noted that Advent’s new
proposal did not address whether a proposed transaction and any committed financing in connection
therewith would be subject to the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program, and members of
the Board of Directors expressed the view that Maxar’s response to the August 22 Letter and Advent’s
August 29, 2022 email did not warrant a different response than the June 15 Letter.
Following these conversations, on September 6, 2022, Mr. Jablonsky emailed a letter (the “September 6
Letter”) to representatives of Advent, which stated that the Board of Directors had determined that the
proposal contained in the August 22 Letter did not provide a basis for further discussion. The September 6
Letter also noted that, consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors continually assesses
opportunities to enhance Maxar stockholder value, and that following the deployment of the WorldView
Legion program, engagement with respect to a potential transaction might be fruitful.
Additionally, following Mr. Jablonsky’s transmission of the September 6 Letter, members of Maxar’s
management instructed J.P. Morgan to inform Advent that J.P. Morgan was acting as Maxar’s financial
advisor, and to explain to Advent that the September 6 Letter had advised that continued engagement
following the deployment of Maxar’s WorldView Legion program might be more fruitful because of the
possibility that undertaking any potential transaction at the current time could result in significant
distraction and diversion of management’s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar’s strategic
priorities, including the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program, and the Board of
Directors’ concern that Advent and its potential financing sources would not agree to be required to
complete any potential transaction in the event that the WorldView Legion program was not successful.
During these discussions, representatives of Advent explained to representatives of J.P. Morgan that
Advent’s proposal was not conditioned upon the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program.
Acting at the instruction of members of Maxar management, J.P. Morgan asked Advent to provide greater
clarity in writing regarding its commitment to accept the risk that the WorldView Legion program would not
be successful in a potential transaction.
On September 12, 2022, during the course of a conversation at an international trade conference, the
Chief Executive Officer of Party A informed Mr. Jablonsky that Party A had long admired Maxar, and that
Party A might be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Maxar, but would not be prepared to
discuss any such transaction for a period of six to nine months. Mr. Jablonsky informed the Chief Executive
Officer of Party A that Party A should contact Mr. Jablonsky if Party A had a proposal or strategic
transaction that Party A wished to discuss with Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky promptly informed the Board of
Directors of his conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A. Since the September 12, 2022
conversation, representatives of Party A have not made any such proposal.
On September 19, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the “September 19
Letter”) addressed to Mr. Jablonsky and General Estes. The September 19 Letter stated that its purpose was
to clarify that Advent’s proposal was not conditioned upon the successful deployment of the WorldView
Legion program. Mr. Jablonsky promptly shared the September 19 Letter with the Board of Directors
following its receipt.
32 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following receipt of the September 19 Letter, Mr. Jablonsky engaged in discussions with General Estes,
other members of Maxar’s management and representatives of each of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton.
Among other things, these discussions focused on (i) the need for greater clarity with respect to the extent
of Advent’s commitment regarding its proposal not being conditioned on the successful deployment of the
WorldView Legion satellite program, including how such assurances would be documented in the definitive
documentation for a potential transaction, (ii) the challenging state of the U.S. leveraged financing market,
and the concern that potential financing sources might not agree to provide a potential purchaser with
committed financing in a transaction where the purchaser had assumed the risk related to the successful
deployment of the WorldView Legion satellite program, and (iii) the other matters considered by the Board of
Directors at its July 28, 2022 meeting. Following such discussions, members of Maxar’s management
instructed J.P. Morgan to communicate to Advent the need for greater specificity with respect to the matters
addressed in the September 19 Letter, as well as the need for Advent to reaffirm its $50 per share price.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan promptly communicated these messages to Advent.
On September 30, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed to Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the “September 30
Letter”). The September 30 Letter stated that Advent appreciated the feedback it had received from
representatives of J.P. Morgan with respect to the September 19 Letter, and sought to clarify the meaning of
Advent’s statement that Advent’s proposal was not conditioned upon the successful deployment of the
WorldView Legion program. Specifically, the September 30 Letter stated that: (i) any transaction agreement
would be structured such that Advent would bear 100% of the risk related to any potential failure of the
WorldView Legion program to perform (launch, deployment, post-launch functionality, etc.), such that the
failure of the WorldView Legion program to perform would have no bearing on Advent’s obligation to
consummate the proposed transaction, or affect the purchase price, (ii) such transaction agreement would
expressly exclude WorldView Legion-related risks impacting the future performance of the WorldView Legion
program from any “material adverse effect” definition and closing conditions in such agreement, and would
also not include bring-down tests linked to WorldView Legion program-related representations and
warranties, and (iii) Advent’s potential financing sources had agreed to the framework identified in clauses
(i) and (ii) of this paragraph. Additionally, the September 30 Letter included the $50 price per share that
Advent had included in the August 22 Letter. Mr. Jablonsky promptly shared the September 30 Letter with
the Board of Directors following its receipt.
On October 12, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which members
of Maxar’s senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Wachtell Lipton were
present. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was for the Board of Directors to discuss
the updated proposal from Advent to acquire Maxar for $50 per share in cash contained in the August 22
Letter, as supplemented by the September 19 Letter and the September 30 Letter. A representative of Wachtell
Lipton discussed legal matters, including the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the
context of the consideration of Advent’s proposal. Additionally, members of Maxar’s management and of J.P.
Morgan reviewed with the Board of Directors the July 2022 Base Case Forecast, as well as the October 2022
Satellite Loss Case Forecast, which had been prepared by Maxar’s management to analyze the long-term
financial impact of the potential loss or failure of satellites, including satellites that are to be part of the
WorldView Legion satellite program, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Certain Financial Projections.” Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Board of Directors
their preliminary financial analysis of the proposal contained in the August 22 Letter. The representatives of
J.P. Morgan also discussed various precedent transactions, including recent leveraged buyout transactions
by private equity sponsors, the state of the U.S. leveraged financing market and the difficulties facing that
market at present, including the potential impact such difficulties could have on Advent’s ability to obtain
financing in connection with a potential transaction, and other public market considerations.
Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors further discussed the proposal and
potential responses, including in the context of Maxar’s standalone plan, as well as potential short- and
long-term execution and strategic risks to Maxar’s long-range financial plan on a standalone basis. In
particular, members of the Board of Directors discussed (i) that Advent’s $50 per share proposal represented
approximately a 96% premium to the closing price of Maxar common stock on August 19, 2022, as well as an
approximately 173% premium to the closing price of Maxar common stock on September 29, 2022, the day
prior to the September 30 Letter, (ii) the statements contained in the September 19 Letter and the
33 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
September 30 Letter with respect to Advent’s acceptance of risks related to the WorldView Legion program in
a potential transaction, (iii) the intensive efforts required of Maxar and its management to successfully
execute on Maxar’s strategic priorities, including making the WorldView Legion program a success, and the
distraction that could result from engaging with Advent or other potential acquirers with respect to a
potential transaction, along with the fact that there would be no guarantee that Maxar would reach final
agreement with respect to such a transaction, even one that shifted the risk related to the deployment of the
WorldView Legion program to the purchaser, and (iv) the challenging state of the U.S. leveraged financing
market, and the Board of Directors’ assessment that it might be challenging for Advent to secure committed
financing for a potential transaction. The Board of Directors also discussed, including with representatives
of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan, whether it would be advisable to contact other potential bidders,
including in the context of an auction, before engaging discussions with Advent. As part of such
discussions, the Board of Directors also considered concerns that such a process could result in additional
distraction and diversion of management’s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar’s strategic
priorities, including the successful deployment of the Worldview Legion program, and that such a process
could also result in market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction, which could disrupt Maxar’s
business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in Maxar’s stockholder base
and potential stock price volatility. Additionally, the members of the Board of Directors discussed whether it
would be in the best interest of Maxar and its stockholders to permit Advent to perform a limited amount of
confirmatory commercial due diligence, in order to evaluate whether Advent’s proposal to acquire Maxar and
to obtain the committed financing required in connection therewith, was executable, while also minimizing the
distraction to members of management as they continued to execute on Maxar’s strategic priorities, including
preparing for the deployment of the WorldView Legion program. Following discussion of these and other
considerations among members of the Board of Directors, Maxar’s management and Maxar’s financial and
legal advisors, the Board of Directors did not reach a conclusion with respect to any further engagement
with Advent, but determined to meet again to continue its discussion.
On October 16, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which members
of Maxar’s senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Wachtell Lipton were
present. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was for the Board of Directors to continue
its discussion of Advent’s proposal to acquire Maxar for $50 per share in cash contained in the August 22
Letter, as supplemented by the September 19 Letter and the September 30 Letter. A representative of Wachtell
Lipton discussed certain legal matters, including the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law
in the context of the consideration of Advent’s proposal. Additionally, representatives of J.P. Morgan
discussed in greater detail the state of the U.S. leveraged finance market, including that some transactions
continued to be completed notwithstanding the generally challenging financing environment, noting that
direct lenders had played a more prominent role in acquisition financings in recent months, and that Advent
had expressed an interest in working with direct lenders in connection with the financing of a proposed
transaction with Maxar.
Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors discussed whether or not the proposal
from Advent was credible, including based on Advent’s prior diligence evaluation that Advent noted in its
prior letters that it had completed, Advent’s efforts to engage with potential financing sources and its
willingness to bear the risk with respect to the WorldView Legion program between the signing and closing
of any transaction. Members of Maxar’s senior management then discussed with the Board of Directors their
views with respect to the possibility of a transaction with Advent, and their opinion on the views of Maxar’s
stockholders with respect to such a transaction. The Board of Directors discussed a framework for potential
limited engagement with Advent with respect to a potential transaction, noting that at any time Maxar would
have the opportunity to immediately terminate discussions with Advent should it become clear that Advent
would not be able to provide a fully financed transaction with a customary degree of transaction certainty, or
if the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of Maxar and its stockholders to do so.
Members of the Board of Directors discussed this framework and, after considering the factors discussed at
both of the October 12, 2022 and October 16, 2022 meetings of the Board of Directors, instructed
management to proceed with providing a limited amount of business diligence to Advent, with instructions
to Advent that, prior to the Thanksgiving holiday on November 24, 2022, Advent would be required to
deliver a revised proposal to Maxar including, in particular, documentation and other assurance to support
the availability of committed financing to Advent for a proposed transaction at a price of at least $50 per
share.
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following this determination, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Advent to
explain the proposed framework. Additionally, between October 17, 2022 and October 19, 2022, Maxar and
Advent negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and
Advent’s legal counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (“Weil”), participating in such negotiations. On
October 19, 2022, Maxar and Advent entered into the confidentiality agreement, which included a customary
standstill provision and a list of permitted financing sources, including BCI. In connection with the entry of
the confidentiality agreement, representatives of Advent shared with Maxar and its advisors a due diligence
request list containing items that Advent stated it required in order to submit the proposal contemplated by
Maxar’s proposed framework.
On October 25 and 26, 2022, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled, in-person meetings in
Westminster, Colorado. During these meetings, Mr. Jablonsky provided an update of the discussions with
Advent, including that Mr. Jablonsky and other members of Maxar’s senior management had scheduled a
meeting with representatives of Advent in Colorado for October 28, 2022. Additionally, on October 26, 2022,
members of Maxar’s senior management reviewed with the Board of Directors the October 2022 Base Case
Forecast, which had been prepared by Maxar’s management in the ordinary course to (i) reflect, among other
updates, Maxar’s actual financial results for the period since the July 2022 Base Case Forecast had been
prepared, and (ii) incorporate management’s projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027,
as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Certain Financial Projections.”
On October 27, 2022, Maxar began uploading due diligence materials to a confidential data room hosted
by Intralinks (the “Data Room”). Representatives of Advent received access to the Data Room shortly
thereafter.
On October 28, 2022, members of Maxar’s management met in person with representatives of Advent
and of certain potential financing sources with whom Maxar had given its prior written consent for Advent to
share Maxar’s confidential information in Colorado, including BCI. At this meeting, management of Maxar
provided representatives of Advent with additional information regarding Maxar’s business, potential areas
of value and Maxar’s management’s view of Maxar’s future prospects as a standalone company.
Additionally, Maxar’s management and representatives of Advent and of the potential financing sources
held multiple business diligence meetings by videoconference during the weeks of November 7, 2022 and
November 14, 2022. Additionally, during this time, Maxar made available additional confidential business
diligence information to Advent and its representatives, as well as to the potential financing sources.
On November 2, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the “November 2
Letter”) addressed to Mr. Jablonsky stating that they appreciated the opportunity to meet with Mr.
Jablonsky and members of Maxar’s management in Colorado during the management presentation on
October 28, 2022. The November 2 Letter also stated that Advent continued to be very interested in pursuing
an acquisition of Maxar at $50 per share, and would look to improve on the $50 per share price, as outlined in
Advent’s August 22 Letter. Additionally, the November 2 Letter stated that Advent and the potential
financing sources anticipated submitting an updated proposal with draft documentation related to the
committed financing prior to the Thanksgiving holiday as contemplated by the framework proposed by
Maxar. The November 2 Letter also requested that Maxar consent to provide confidential information to a
limited number of additional potential financing sources, including additional direct lenders, in order to
increase the certainty of any committed financing, and potentially improve its terms. Mr. Jablonsky promptly
shared the November 2 Letter with the Board of Directors following its receipt. Additionally, Maxar provided
its consent for Advent to share confidential information with a limited number of additional potential
financing sources.
On November 11, 2022, a representative of a global investment bank placed a telephone call to Mr.
Jablonsky. The representative of the global investment bank informed Mr. Jablonsky that he was calling on
behalf of a client that might be interested in a potential strategic transaction with Maxar, and that he was
calling to gauge Maxar’s interest in such a transaction. The representative of the global investment bank,
however, declined to identify his client to Mr. Jablonsky. Mr. Jablonsky informed the representative that
Maxar continually assesses opportunities to enhance Maxar stockholder value, and that if the
representative’s client had a proposal for Maxar and the Board of Directors to consider, then the
representative’s client should contact Mr. Jablonsky. Mr. Jablonsky promptly informed the Board of
Directors of his conversation with the representative of the global investment bank.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 22, 2022, Maxar filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “EchoStar 8-K”) disclosing that
Maxar had entered into an amendment to its contract (such amendment, the “EchoStar Amendment” and
such contract, the “EchoStar Contract”) with an affiliate of EchoStar Corporation (“EchoStar”) related to the
delay of the shipment of the JUPITER 3 satellite, following EchoStar having communicated its intention to
Maxar to terminate its contract with Maxar as a result of the delay and demand return of all monies paid by
EchoStar to Maxar. Additionally, the EchoStar 8-K also disclosed the anticipated financial impact of the
amendment on Maxar’s guidance, including that (i) there will be no change to Maxar’s 2022 free cash flow
guidance, (ii) there will be a $65 million reduction in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022, (iii) there will be
an approximately $20 million reduction in free cash flow in 2023 related primarily to the forgone payments
from EchoStar, and (iv) there would be up to an estimated $30 to $40 million reduction in free cash flow in
2023 attributable to the purchase of goods and/or services pursuant to a certain separate commercial
agreement entered into between Maxar and EchoStar, as amended. In response to these events, Maxar’s
management made adjustments to its long-term strategic plan as a result of the EchoStar Amendment, which
adjustments were incorporated into the November 2022 Base Case Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite
Loss Case Forecast, in each case as defined and described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Certain Financial Projections.”
On November 23, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed a letter to Mr. Jablonsky containing a
proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock for $50 per share in cash (the
“November 23 Proposal”). Consistent with the framework proposed by Maxar following its Board of
Directors’ October 16, 2022 meeting, the November 23 Proposal also (i) stated that Advent had completed its
commercial and financial due diligence, (ii) confirmed that Advent and its potential financing sources had
completed its diligence with respect to the WorldView Legion program and reaffirmed their position that the
transaction would not be conditioned on the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program and
(iii) provided additional detail with respect to the equity and debt financing plan for the proposed
transaction. Advent included with the November 23 Proposal drafts of each of the Commitment Letters,
which were subject to the completion of confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation of definitive
transaction documentation. The November 23 Proposal also reaffirmed that the successful deployment of the
WorldView Legion program would not be a condition to the consummation of the financing in connection
with the proposed transaction, and stated that Advent was in a position to negotiate definitive
documentation with Maxar and announce a transaction by December 16, 2022. As a next step, the November
23 Proposal suggested that the parties and their advisors engage immediately, including with respect to
customary confirmatory due diligence to supplement the materials provided to date. Mr. Jablonsky promptly
shared the November 23 Proposal with the Board of Directors following its receipt.
On November 23, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which
members of Maxar’s senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Wachtell
Lipton were present. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was for the Board of Directors
to discuss the November 23 Proposal, and the Board of Directors’ response to such proposal. Mr. Jablonsky
summarized Maxar’s interactions with Advent and its representatives since the October 16, 2022 meeting of
the Board of Directors, including the October 28, 2022 management presentation. The representatives of J.P.
Morgan then reviewed current market conditions, Maxar’s historical stock price and financial profile and the
perspectives of financial analysts that cover Maxar. Additionally, the representatives of J.P. Morgan
reviewed the financial market’s reaction to the recently announced amendment to the EchoStar Contract, and
members of the Board of Directors and their financial and legal advisors discussed the risks inherent in
Maxar’s business and the potential for the proposed transaction to “de-risk” for stockholders Maxar’s
execution with respect to its WorldView Legion program and the other aspects of its long-term plan. The
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton then reviewed the terms of the November 23 Proposal,
including the draft debt and equity commitment letters provided with the proposal, which were intended to
address the Board of Directors’ questions at prior meetings regarding Advent’s commitment to the proposal
and its ability to obtain committed financing in a challenging acquisition financing market. Representatives
of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton also discussed Advent’s proposed timeline, which included a target
announcement date of December 16, 2022. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then presented to the Board of
Directors its preliminary financial analyses of the November 23 Proposal, based on the November 2022 Base
Case Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast.
36 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Additionally, members of Maxar’s management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with
the Board of Directors the inclusion of BCI as a minority equity investor as part of the November 23
Proposal, and the fact that Milbank had informed members of Maxar’s management that the proposed
transaction outlined in the November 23 Proposal would be subject to CFIUS’s jurisdiction.
Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors, Maxar’s management and representatives
of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton discussed the November 23 Proposal, including whether the proposal
provided a basis with which to engage with Advent and whether it represented an improvement over
Advent’s prior proposals. In particular, members of the Board of Directors discussed (i) Advent’s continued
willingness to accept the risk related to the WorldView Legion program, such that Maxar would not be
subject to risk of non-consummation of a transaction based on the success of that program, (ii) the fact that
the $50 price per share represented a 116% premium to the closing price of Maxar common stock on
November 23, 2022 and (iii) the likely regulatory approvals in connection with a proposed transaction and the
potential timeline associated in connection therewith.
Members of the Board of Directors, Maxar’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Wachtell Lipton discussed the benefits and risks of potential next steps available to Maxar, including (i)
ceasing engagement with Advent and continuing as a standalone company, (ii) engaging with Advent on its
proposed timeline of a December 16, 2022 announcement, without proactively seeking other potential
bidders, and requiring as a condition of such engagement with Advent that any definitive agreement with
Advent include a “go-shop” provision or other mechanism that would permit Maxar to solicit and entertain
potentially superior proposals from other bidders while having a binding contract with Advent, or (iii)
engaging with Advent, either on its proposed timeline or on a longer timeline, while also reaching out to
other potential bidders before entering into a transaction with Advent. In particular, the Board of Directors,
Maxar’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton discussed the risks of
contacting other bidders before engaging in continued discussions with Advent, including concerns that
market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt Maxar’s business relationships and
risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in Maxar’s stockholder base and potential stock price
volatility, and the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire Maxar given its
size and the challenging U.S. market for acquisition financing. Members of the Board of Directors also
discussed the fact that, given that the first anticipated launch of the Worldview Legion satellite program was
planned for early 2023, announcing a proposed transaction with Advent by December 16, 2022 would “de-
risk” the effect of that launch for Maxar stockholders. Additionally, members of the Board of Directors
directed J.P. Morgan and Maxar’s management to seek to increase the $50 per share price set forth in the
November 23 Proposal.
Following this discussion, Mr. Jablonsky, the other members of Maxar’s management and the
representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting, and the independent members of the Board of Directors met
in executive session with Wachtell Lipton. General Estes explained that the purpose of the executive session
was for the independent members of the Board of Directors to discuss whether to continue engagement with
Advent, and if so, under what terms. A representative of Wachtell Lipton then advised the independent
members of the Board of Directors of their fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of their
consideration of Advent’s proposal. The independent members of the Board of Directors then discussed the
November 23 Proposal, and the best path available to maximize value for Maxar and its stockholders, during
which the directors discussed each of the factors and considerations previously mentioned, along with the
impact of the recent EchoStar settlement described in the EchoStar 8-K, the directors’ high level of
confidence in Maxar’s management team, the risks inherent in Maxar’s business and the potential for the
proposed transaction to “de-risk” for stockholders Maxar’s execution with respect to its WorldView Legion
program and the other aspects of its long-term plan.
Following this discussion, Mr. Jablonsky and members of Maxar’s management rejoined the meeting.
Members of the Board of Directors then discussed Maxar’s potential as a standalone company with members
of management and the risks inherent in Maxar’s business, as well as the valuation of Advent’s November 23
Proposal, and the committed financing that Advent appeared likely to secure if a proposed transaction could
be agreed. As a result, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that it was in the best interest of
Maxar and its stockholders to proceed to negotiate the terms and documentation of an acquisition of Maxar
by affiliates of Advent, for cash, including to determine if the $50 price per share proposed by Advent
37 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the November 23 Proposal could be improved, and seek from Advent assurances of satisfactory
arrangements with respect to both financing and other matters related to transaction certainty, and to inform
Advent that any merger agreement must include a “go-shop” or other similar mechanism to provide a market
check, subject in all cases to final approval by the Board of Directors.
Following the Thanksgiving holiday, on November 25, 2022, after discussions with Mr. Jablonsky and
members of Maxar’s management, representatives of J.P. Morgan met telephonically with representatives of
Advent. During this telephone call, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with Advent changes to the
November 23 Proposal that could make it more attractive to Maxar, including: (i) meaningfully improving the
$50 price per share in the November 23 Proposal; (ii) providing for a robust go-shop period during which
Maxar and its representatives would be permitted to solicit bids from third parties; (iii) providing a
termination fee equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction, payable by Maxar to Advent in the event
that Maxar terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into a definitive agreement with a topping bidder,
provided that such termination fee would be equal to 1.25% of the equity value of the transaction if Maxar
terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into an agreement with a bidder during the go-shop period;
and (iv) providing a high degree of transaction certainty, including with respect to obtaining any required
regulatory approvals.
On November 25, 2022 and November 26, 2022, representatives of Advent and J.P. Morgan engaged in
multiple conversations with respect to the items raised by J.P. Morgan on November 25. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan kept Mr. Jablonsky updated as to the status of these conversations. On November 26, 2022,
representatives of Advent met by videoconference with representatives of J.P. Morgan and orally provided
an updated proposal (the “November 26 Proposal”). The November 26 Proposal contained the same terms as
the November 23 Proposal, except that (i) the price per share in cash paid to Maxar stockholders would be
$53, (ii) the merger agreement would provide Maxar with a 60-day go-shop period, and (iii) the merger
agreement would provide for a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction, payable
by Maxar to Advent in the event that Maxar terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into a definitive
agreement with a topping bidder, provided that such termination fee would be equal to 1.25% of the equity
value of the transaction if Maxar terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into an agreement with a
bidder during the 60-day go-shop period. Additionally, Advent stated that the parties were willing to provide
a high degree of transaction certainty, including with respect to obtaining the CFIUS Approval and any other
required regulatory approvals. Advent suggested that representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Milbank and J.P.
Morgan discuss questions they might have with respect to the CFIUS Approval and other required
regulatory approvals with representatives of Weil and Covington & Burling LLP (“Covington”), regulatory
counsel to Advent. Representatives of J.P. Morgan promptly summarized the terms of the November 26
Proposal to Mr. Jablonsky, members of Maxar’s management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton. Mr.
Jablonsky promptly shared the details of the November 26 Proposal with the Board of Directors following its
receipt.
On November 27, 2022, representatives of Weil, Covington, Wachtell Lipton and Milbank met by
videoconference. During this meeting, representatives of Covington provided an overview of BCI and
described the regulatory efforts commitments to which Advent was willing to agree in the definitive
transaction documentation, which would provide a high degree of transaction certainty, including with
respect to obtaining any required regulatory approvals. Following the November 27, 2022 meeting,
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Milbank described the information provided during the meeting,
including Advent’s proposed regulatory efforts commitments, to Maxar’s management. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Regulatory Approvals and Related
Matters.”
Consistent with the views expressed by the Board of Directors at its November 23, 2022 meeting, on
November 28, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed representatives of Advent that Maxar was
prepared to proceed to negotiate a transaction on the terms of the November 26 Proposal, but that any such
proposed transaction was subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation and the approval of the
Board of Directors.
In addition, beginning on November 28, 2022, Maxar made certain additional due diligence materials
available to Advent and its representatives in the Data Room. Thereafter, from November 28, 2022 through
December 15, 2022, Advent, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted confirmatory due diligence on
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Maxar, including through the additional materials made available in the Data Room and telephone and
videoconference calls with members of Maxar’s management. Also, during that period representatives of
Wachtell Lipton and Milbank participated in telephone and videoconference calls with Advent, BCI and their
respective regulatory counsel with respect to regulatory due diligence.
On November 29, 2022, the representative of the global investment bank that had contacted Mr.
Jablonsky on November 11, 2022 placed a telephone call to Mr. Jablonsky. During this telephone call, the
representative identified his client as Party B, and asked that Mr. Jablonsky speak with the Chief Executive
Officer of Party B to discuss Party B’s thoughts on a potential strategic transaction. On November 30, 2022,
Mr. Jablonsky and his executive assistant contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Party B to schedule a
telephone call, which was scheduled for December 8, 2022. During the December 8, 2022 telephone
conversation, the Chief Executive Officer of Party B informed Mr. Jablonsky that if Maxar ever determined to
engage in a strategic transaction, that Party B would potentially be interested in such a transaction. Mr.
Jablonsky informed the Chief Executive Officer of Party B that if Party B wished to make a proposal providing
for a strategic transaction with Maxar, then it should do so promptly, in writing. Mr. Jablonsky promptly
informed the Board of Directors of his conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Party B.
On November 30, 2022, Weil provided initial drafts to Wachtell Lipton of the proposed merger agreement
and the other transaction documents. Between November 30, 2022 and December 15, 2022, the parties’
respective management teams and legal and financial advisors engaged in extensive negotiations regarding
the terms of the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documentation. During the course of
these negotiations, areas of discussion and negotiation between the parties included, among other things,
the specific terms of the go-shop provisions, the size and triggers of the Parent Termination Fee, Maxar’s
obligations with respect to the operation of its business during the period between the signing of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, the scope of the restrictions applicable to actions taken by
Maxar during the period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger,
the termination provisions and the triggers of the Company Termination Fee payable by Maxar, the
representations and warranties to be made by the parties, and the provisions regarding Maxar’s equity
awards, employee benefit plans, retention, severance and other compensation matters.
On December 11, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which
members of Maxar’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Wachtell Lipton and Milbank were
present. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was to provide an update on the status of
discussions with Advent with respect to a proposed transaction. Mr. Jablonsky and representatives of J.P.
Morgan then provided an overview of the discussions with Advent since the Board of Directors’ November
23, 2022 meeting, including the terms of the November 26 Proposal. Additionally, Mr. Jablonsky and Maxar’s
financial and legal advisors provided an overview of the status of negotiations, the principal terms of the
transaction documentation, the confirmatory due diligence review and the timing for a potential transaction
announcement, which was anticipated to be December 16, 2022. Additionally, representatives of Milbank
provided an update on the regulatory approvals required in connection with the proposed transaction and
the likely time to completion. Following this discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview
of the potential go-shop process if the parties reached a proposed transaction. After this discussion,
representatives of J.P. Morgan departed the meeting. Members of the Board of Directors then reviewed
disclosures from J.P. Morgan regarding material relationships with Maxar, Advent and certain of their
respective affiliates. The Board of Directors reviewed the disclosures and determined that none of the
disclosed relationships would impact J.P. Morgan’s ability to act as financial advisor to Maxar in connection
with the potential transaction. The Board of Directors reiterated to members of Maxar’s management the
directive it had provided at its November 23, 2022 meeting, and instructed Maxar’s management and its
advisors to attempt to negotiate a transaction on the terms described in the November 26 Proposal, subject
to final approval by the Board of Directors.
On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended
by members of Maxar’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Wachtell Lipton and Milbank.
During this meeting, members of Maxar’s management and its financial and legal advisors reviewed the
history of negotiations with Advent. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed J.P. Morgan’s financial
analyses of the Merger Consideration provided for in the proposed Merger Agreement with Advent, based
on
39 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the projections set forth in the November 2022 Base Case Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite Loss
Case Forecast. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary
duties under Delaware law in the context of their consideration of the potential transaction, and the principal
terms of the draft Merger Agreement and other transaction documentation, including the terms of the
proposed Financing. Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors then reviewed updated
disclosures from J.P. Morgan regarding material relationships with Maxar, Advent and their respective
affiliates, and J.P. Morgan’s ownership of common equity of Maxar and its affiliates, which were consistent
with the disclosures discussed at the Board of Directors’ December 11, 2022 meeting. Following this
discussion, members of Maxar’s management discussed with the Board of Directors the proposed
communications strategy in connection with the announcement of the proposed transaction, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan led a discussion of the process that would begin once the 60-day go-shop
period commenced after the announcement of the transaction, including with respect to planned outreach to
potential bidders, including Party A and Party B. Following this discussion, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral
opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, to the Board of Directors on
December 15, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in the
proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement entitled “- Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.”
Following further discussion and deliberation, including taking into account the factors described
below in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Recommendation of the Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the Board of Directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
Agreement, the other transaction documents, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Maxar and its stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted the
Merger Agreement, the other transaction documents, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement, (iii) recommended that Maxar
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be
submitted for consideration by Maxar stockholders at the Special Meeting.
Following the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of the parties executed the Merger
Agreement and the other transaction documents on the evening of December 15, 2022. Before the opening of
financial markets in New York on December 16, 2022, the parties issued a press release announcing the
transaction. The press release announcing the transaction also noted that the Merger Agreement included a
60-day go-shop period that would expire on February 14, 2023.
On December 16, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Maxar, acting at the direction of the Board of
Directors, began contacting potential counterparties that might consider making an Acquisition Proposal in
connection with the Go-Shop Period, including Party A and Party B. Over the course of the Go-Shop Period,
J.P. Morgan and Maxar engaged with or actively solicited Acquisition Proposals from 36 potentially
interested third parties, including Party A and Party B. Maxar executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements with two of those 36 parties (including Party B) and subsequently provided non-public
information relating to Maxar and its subsidiaries to those two parties.
The Go-Shop Period expired at 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 14, 2023. To date, no party has
made an Acquisition Proposal following the execution of the Merger Agreement.",38,49

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at
the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, to be advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of Maxar and its stockholders, and recommend that Maxar stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors consulted with Maxar’s senior management team, as well as our
financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors that
the Board of Directors viewed as supporting its decision:
the current and historical trading prices of shares of Maxar common stock, and the fact that the
Merger Consideration of $53.00 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 129% to the
closing price of Maxar common stock as of December 15, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public
announcement of the Merger Agreement, a premium of approximately 135% to the volume weighted
average price of Maxar common stock over the 60 days prior to the announcement of the Merger
Agreement and a premium of approximately 34% to the highest price of Maxar common stock over the
52 weeks prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement;
the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including risks related to
Maxar’s execution with respect to its WorldView Legion program, Maxar’s need to frequently raise or
expend capital due to the capital intensive nature of Maxar’s business, and the difficulty and cost of
obtaining capital, the risks associated with execution of Maxar’s growth into existing and new
markets, and the difficulty of accurately forecasting customer demand in connection therewith, the
fact that Maxar conducts a significant amount of its business with governmental entities, and such
business is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts, and Maxar’s reliance on systems and
satellites that are subject to the risks of operating in space and in support of government missions;
that the Merger Agreement provides that no effect relating to or arising from Maxar’s WorldView
Legion satellite program can constitute or contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect, and the
consummation of the Merger is not conditioned on the absence of any such effect or the success of
the WorldView Legion program;
the fact that the Merger Consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with
certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the Merger, in comparison to the
risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent value from Maxar’s
standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives involving transactions in which all or a
portion of the consideration would be payable in equity or involving sales of one or more of our lines
of business;
the Board of Directors’ knowledge of the business, assets, operations, financial condition, earnings
and prospects of Maxar, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in
which Maxar and each of its businesses operate, including economic, market and capital raising
conditions;
the Board of Directors’ belief that the Merger is more favorable to Maxar stockholders than the other
strategic alternatives available to Maxar, including remaining as an independent public company, the
feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing
such alternatives;
the fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations and that we
negotiated an increase by Advent from its June 15, 2022 proposed price of $48.00 per share, and the
fact that representatives of Advent informed representatives of the Company and its financial advisor
that the Merger Consideration was the maximum price that Advent was willing to pay;
Advent’s experience investing in and operating companies in the defense, space and information
services industries, including companies critical to U.S. national security, and track record as a
responsible owner of defense and security businesses;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the fact that Advent is headquartered in the United States and that Maxar will remain a U.S.-
controlled and operated company following the consummation of the Merger;
the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire Maxar in light of its size
and unique line of business, as well as the ability to obtain committed acquisition financing in the
current economic climate and interest rate environment;
the fact that Parent has obtained committed debt and preferred equity financing from reputable
financial institutions and committed equity financing from the Sponsors in an aggregate amount,
together with the available cash and cash equivalents (in each case, if any) of Maxar, sufficient to
fund the Required Amounts under the Merger Agreement;
Parent’s obligation under the Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things proper, advisable or necessary to
consummate and obtain the Financing on terms (subject to certain exceptions) and conditions
described in the applicable Financing Commitments;
the Board of Directors’ belief that contacting other potential bidders prior to signing a definitive
agreement with Advent would result in significant risks to Maxar and its business, including
concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the launch and
deployment of satellites as part of Maxar’s WorldView Legion satellite program, Maxar’s business
relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and
potential stock price volatility;
the Board of Directors’ belief, based on interactions of representatives of Maxar with representatives
of Advent, that soliciting other potential buyers prior to signing a definitive agreement with Advent
could delay or jeopardize the availability of Advent’s proposal;
Maxar’s right under the Merger Agreement to a 60-day “go-shop” period, during which Maxar may
actively solicit Acquisition Proposals (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Go-Shop Period”) from, and furnish information to and conduct negotiations
with, third parties, providing an opportunity to determine if a third party is willing to pay a higher
value per share than Advent;
Maxar’s right under the Merger Agreement, in response to unsolicited acquisition proposals, to
furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties in certain circumstances (in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement);
the Board of Directors’ right, under the Merger Agreement, to fail to make, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify its recommendation that our stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement under certain
circumstances, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, including Maxar’s payment of the
Company Termination Fee if Parent elects to terminate the Merger Agreement in such circumstances;
Maxar’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances and subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation
of a Superior Proposal, upon Maxar’s payment of the Company Termination Fee;
the fact that in certain circumstances a lower Company Termination Fee of $51.9 million (representing
approximately 1.25% of Maxar’s equity value) would be payable by Maxar, and that the lower
termination fee of $51.9 million and the Company Termination Fee of $124.5 million (representing
approximately 3% of Maxar’s equity value) were viewed by the Board of Directors, after consultation
with our outside legal counsel and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances and not
likely to preclude or discourage any other party from making a competing acquisition proposal,
particularly with respect to those parties that make an acquisition proposal during the Go-Shop
Period;
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
the risks and uncertainties that continue to be created by the ongoing conflict between the Russian
Federation and Ukraine, including disruptions and dislocations to the equity and debt capital
markets, as well as the impact of the increase in interest rates, and the stated intention of members of
the Federal Open Market Committee to continue to increase interest rates in 2023;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the high probability that the Merger would be completed based on, among other things, Advent’s
proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions, the absence of a financing condition, and
the $249 million Parent Termination Fee (representing approximately 6% of Maxar’s equity value)
payable to Maxar if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is
guaranteed by the Guarantors;
the financial analyses presented to the Board of Directors by J.P. Morgan and the fact that J.P.
Morgan rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written
opinion, to the Board of Directors on December 15, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC”  (the full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated
December 15, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its
opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference);
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which were reviewed by the Board of Directors
with our financial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of robust arm’s-
length negotiations between the parties;
Maxar’s ability, under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific
performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent
other breaches of the Merger Agreement;
the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to holders of shares of Maxar common stock
who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required
procedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to
have a Delaware court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or
the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement; and
the fact that the Merger would be subject to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Maxar
stockholders, and Maxar stockholders would be free to reject the proposed transactions by voting
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be
made prior to the Special Meeting (which would, in certain cases, be subject to payment by Maxar in
certain circumstances of a $124.5 million Company Termination Fee if Maxar subsequently were to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, an Acquisition Proposal).
The Board of Directors also considered a variety of risk and other potential negative factors in its
consideration of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the following material potentially negative
factors:
our inability, after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on February 14, 2023, to solicit competing
acquisition proposals and the possibility that the $124.5 million Company Termination Fee (or $51.9
million Company Termination Fee under certain circumstances) payable by us upon the termination of
the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential bidders from
making a competing bid to acquire us;
the fact that, following the Merger, Maxar will no longer exist as an independent public company and
our existing stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth;
the fact that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner, or at all, due to a failure of
certain conditions to the closing of the Merger;
the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate
the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Maxar stockholders, as well
as the risk that the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be obtained,
resulting in Parent, Merger Sub and Preferred Equity Issuer not having sufficient funds to complete
the Merger, or that Parent, Merger Sub and Preferred Equity Issuer may otherwise not obtain
sufficient funds to complete the Merger;

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 26, 2022, Maxar retained J.P. Morgan as its financial
advisor in connection with the proposed Merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the
proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Board of Directors on December 15, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to
the Board of Directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions

TABLE OF CONTENTS
set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in
the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its
December 15, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board of Directors, dated December
15, 2022, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in
the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated December 15, 2022, which sets forth, among
other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P.
Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such
opinion. Maxar stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was
addressed to the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its
evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did
not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the
consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Maxar or as
to the underlying decision by Maxar to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of Maxar as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the
proposed Merger or any other matter.
In connection with preparing its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
reviewed a draft dated December 15, 2022 of the Merger Agreement;
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Maxar and the
industries in which it operates;
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of
certain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for
such companies;
compared the financial and operating performance of Maxar with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and
historical market prices of the Maxar common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such
other companies;
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by Maxar’s management relating
to its business; and
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P.
Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of Maxar’s management with respect to
certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of Maxar, the financial condition
and future prospects and operations of Maxar and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or
appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Maxar or
otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such
information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with Maxar, J.P. Morgan
did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct
or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate
the solvency of Maxar, Parent, Preferred Equity Issuer or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P.
Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on
assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the
expected future results of operations and financial condition of Maxar to which such analyses or forecasts
relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they
were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger
45 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement, and that the definitive Merger
Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P.
Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by Maxar, Parent, Preferred Equity
Issuer and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct
in all respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the
assessments made by advisors to Maxar with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all
material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Maxar or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
The projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by Maxar’s management. Maxar does not
publicly disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P.
Morgan’s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward
public disclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain and may be beyond the control of Maxar’s management, including, without limitation, factors
related to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual
results could vary significantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the
use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the section of this proxy statement
entitled “-",53,59
Maxar Technologies Inc._20230316_DEFM14A_20730460_4617137.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
While Maxar has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Maxar has not, as a
matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings, or
other results beyond the then-current annual period due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of
accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and
subjectivity of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in the ordinary course, Maxar’s
management prepares a long-term strategic plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Board
of Directors, that reflects Maxar’s management’s financial and business outlook for Maxar. In connection
with the proposed Merger, Maxar is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited
prospective financial information of Maxar, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger,
prepared by Maxar’s management, solely because, as described below, certain financial information was
given to the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration and evaluation of the Merger and to J.P.
Morgan for its use and reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to the
Board of Directors and J.P. Morgan’s opinion as discussed in “- Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.”
At a meeting of the Board of Directors on July 28, 2022, Maxar’s management provided to the Board of
Directors one set of non-public, unaudited financial projections included in Maxar’s long-term strategic plan,
which covered the second half of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 through the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2026 (referred to herein as the “July 2022 Base Case Forecast”), which forecast was based on
and reflected, among other things, the following assumptions: (1) the successful launch by early 2023 of
each of the six satellites that make up Maxar’s WorldView Legion satellite program; (2) the successful
operation
50 TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Maxar’s entire existing satellite constellation; and (3) the successful execution of Maxar’s strategy,
including its growth strategy, across each of the Maxar’s three business lines. Additionally, Maxar’s
management provided a copy of the July 2022 Base Case Forecast to J.P. Morgan for use in its preliminary
financial analysis of Maxar that was presented to the Board of Directors at the July 28, 2022 meeting.
From time to time, Maxar’s management has also prepared a “downside” version of its long-term
strategic plan that assumed that one or more of Maxar’s satellites would suffer a negative impact. In
connection with the Board of Directors’ consideration of Advent’s August 22 Letter, as defined and
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Background of the Merger,” Maxar’s management
prepared a second set of non-public, unaudited financial projections for the second half of the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2022 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026 (such forecast is referred to in
this proxy statement as the “October Satellite Loss Case Forecast”), which forecast was based on and
reflected, among other things, the following assumptions: (1) the permanent loss of two out of the six
satellites that make up Maxar’s WorldView Legion satellite program (i.e., the complete failure of one launch in
connection with the WorldView Legion satellite program), the financial impact of which was also intended to
represent either (A) the potential impact of the permanent loss of two out of the six satellites that make up
Maxar’s WorldView Legion satellite program or (B) the potential impact of the permanent loss of WorldView 3
satellite, in each case, which could be more or less, depending on the circumstances; (2) the successful
operation otherwise of Maxar’s entire existing satellite constellation; and (3) the successful execution of
Maxar’s strategy, including its growth strategy, across each of Maxar’s three business lines. The October
2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast was prepared by adjusting the July 2022 Base Case Forecast to reflect the
assumptions described in the previous sentence. Maxar’s management provided the October Satellite Loss
Case Forecast to the Board of Directors at a meeting on October 12, 2022. Additionally, Maxar’s management
provided a copy of the October Satellite Loss Case Forecast to J.P. Morgan for use in their preliminary
financial analysis of Maxar that was presented to the Board of Directors at the October 12, 2022 meeting.
At a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors on October 26, 2022, in connection with a
review of Maxar’s performance against the financial targets in the long-term strategic plan, Maxar’s
management prepared and provided to the Board of Directors certain updates to the July 2022 Base Case
Forecast to (i) reflect, among other updates, Maxar’s actual financial results for the period since the July 2022
Base Case Forecast had been prepared, and (ii) incorporate management’s projected results for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2027 (such updated non-public, unaudited financial projections, which covered
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2027, the “October 2022 Base Case
Forecast”). A copy of the October 2022 Base Case Forecast was provided to Advent during the management
presentation that took place in Colorado on October 28, 2022, following execution of a confidentiality
agreement with Maxar, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Background of the
Merger.”
Additionally, in November 2022, Maxar’s management made adjustments to its long-term strategic plan
in order to incorporate the impact of, among other things, (i) the amendment to the EchoStar Contract, as
defined and described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Background of the Merger,” and (ii)
Maxar’s November 3, 2022 acquisition of Wovenware.
At a meeting of the Board of Directors on November 23, 2022, in connection with the Board of Directors’
consideration of the November 23 Proposal, as defined and described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “- Background of the Merger,” Maxar’s management provided to the Board of Directors (i) an
updated version of the October 2022 Base Case Forecast, incorporating the November 2022 changes to the
long-term strategic plan (such updated forecast, the “November 2022 Base Case Forecast”) and (ii) an
updated version of the October 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast, incorporating the November 2022 changes
to the long-term strategic plan and including management’s projections for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2027 (such updated forecast, the “November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast,” and, together with the
July 2022 Base Case Forecast, the October 2022 Base Case Forecast, the October Satellite Loss Case
Forecast and the November 2022 Base Case Forecast, the “Company Projections”). Each of the November
2022 Base Case Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast were provided to J.P. Morgan,
and Maxar directed J.P. Morgan to use and rely on the November 2022 Base Case Forecast and the November
2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast in connection with the financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to the
Board of Directors and J.P. Morgan’s opinion as discussed in “- Opinion of J.P. Morgan
51 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Securities LLC,” and such use and reliance was approved by the Board of Directors. Maxar provided certain
financial information that was used to make the November 2022 adjustments to the October 2022 Base Case
Forecast to Advent, but did not provide Advent with the November 2022 Base Case Forecast, the October
Satellite Loss Case Forecast or the November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast.
Maxar advised the recipients of the Company Projections that its internal financial forecasts are
subjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Company Projections or of this summary does not
constitute an admission or representation by Maxar, J.P. Morgan, or any other person that the information is
material, should not be regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, J.P. Morgan, Maxar or its
management, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of
the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on
as such. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and
readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company Projections.
The Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were
based are subjective in many respects and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions
attributable to the dynamics of Maxar’s industry and based on actual experience and business
developments. The Company Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous
assumptions with respect to Company performance, industry performance, general business, economic,
regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject
to significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond Maxar’s control. The Company
Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and
uncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking
Statements,” that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and
for actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance
that the Company Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower
than projected, and the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results
and should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Company Projections do not
take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared,
including the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the
preparation of the Company Projections may have changed since the date the Company Projections were
prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional
significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be
achieved.
In addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results
after the date the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of
Maxar, Advent or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any
obligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to
reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in
the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error (except, in the case of Maxar, as
required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the
Company Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held more than three months
after the Company Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting
information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company
Projections set forth below. The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the
historical financial statements and other information contained in Maxar’s public filings with the SEC. Maxar
urges all of its stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial
results. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public
disclosure or toward compliance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),
published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither KPMG LLP
(“KPMG”), Maxar’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has
examined, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the Company Projections and, accordingly,

neither KPMG nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto. The KPMG report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Maxar’s
historical financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein
and should not be read to do so.
Maxar has not made and makes no representation to any Maxar stockholder or to Advent, Parent,
Merger Sub or Preferred Equity Issuer in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company
Projections or regarding Maxar’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the
Company Projections or that the projected results will be achieved.
July 2022 Base Case Forecast
Maxar’s management prepared the July 2022 Base Case Forecast with respect to Maxar’s business, as a
standalone company, for the second half of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 through the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2026, except that unlevered free cash flow was calculated by J.P. Morgan solely using
the prospective financial information included in the July 2022 Base Case Forecast, which calculation was
reviewed and approved by Maxar’s management for J.P. Morgan’s reliance and use in connection with the
preliminary financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to the Board of Directors at the July 28, 2022

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, adjusted for certain items affecting the comparability of Maxar’s ongoing operating
results, including restructuring, impairments, insurance recoveries, and transaction and integration
related expense. Transaction and integration related expense includes costs associated with de-
leveraging activities, acquisitions and dispositions and the integration of acquisitions.
Unlevered Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation and
amortization, the pre-interest tax impact, capital expenditures and changes in net working capital, while
adding back depreciation and amortization and other cash flow impacts related to impairments, the
acquisition of Wovenware and the amendment to the EchoStar Contract.
Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning
of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, which are financial measures that are not calculated in
accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP
financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an
alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a
reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP
financial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Company Projections) in connection
with a proposed transaction like the Merger when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy
statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures were not
relied upon by J.P. Morgan for purposes of its financial analysis and opinion or by the Board of Directors in
connection with its consideration of the Merger. Accordingly, Maxar has not provided a reconciliation of the
non-GAAP financial measures included in the Company Projections to the relevant GAAP financial
measures.
The Company Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Maxar of
the Merger and do not attempt to predict or suggest future results following the Merger. The Company
Projections do not give effect to the Merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the Merger
Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the Merger, the effect on
Maxar of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger
Agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would
likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered,
accelerated, postponed, or not taken in anticipation of the Merger. Further, the Company Projections do not
take into account the effect on Maxar of any possible failure of the Merger to occur.",59,64

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that Maxar stockholders approve the
transaction and vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal, Maxar stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of
Maxar have certain interests in the transactions that are or may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Maxar stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and
considered

them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it,
including the Merger, and in making their recommendation that Maxar stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement.
These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them, including compensation that
may become payable in connection with the Merger to named executive officers, which is the subject of a
nonbinding, advisory vote of Maxar stockholders, are quantified in the narrative below. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 2: The Compensation
Proposal.” The dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes
only and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.
For purposes of this disclosure,
the named executive officers of Maxar are:
Daniel L. Jablonsky, Chief Executive Officer
Biggs C. Porter, Chief Financial Officer
Walter S. Scott, Chief Technology Officer
Leon Anthony Frazier, General Manager, Public Sector
James C. Lee, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary
“qualifying termination” means a termination of employment without cause or for good reason (each
term as defined in the relevant agreement)
Treatment of Maxar Equity Awards
Maxar SARs
Each Maxar SAR that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1)
the total number of shares of Maxar common stock subject to such Maxar SAR as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per
share of Maxar common stock subject to such Maxar SAR as of the Effective Time.
Maxar PSU and RSUs
Each Maxar PSU and RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding
any Maxar RSUs granted in 2023 to any individual who is not a non-employee Maxar director (each such
excluded RSU, a “2023 Employee RSU”), whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Maxar common stock
subject to the respective award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Merger
Consideration. For purposes of clause (1) of the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of
common stock subject to a Maxar PSU will equal (i) for a Maxar PSU granted in 2020, 175% of the target
number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such Maxar PSU, (ii) for a Maxar PSU granted in 2021,
176% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such Maxar PSU, and (iii) for a
Maxar PSU granted in 2022, 184% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such
Maxar PSU.
2023 Employee RSUs
For each 2023 Employee RSU, 33% of the number of shares covered by such 2023 Employee RSU that
are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “single trigger shares”), whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1)
the number of single trigger shares and (2) the Merger Consideration, with such payment to be made no later
than 10 business days following the Effective Time. The remaining shares covered by such 2023 Employee
RSU (the “double trigger shares”), whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of double trigger shares and
56 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(2) the Merger Consideration, with such payment to be made in two substantially equal installments on each
of January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, subject to the holder’s continued employment with Maxar, the
Surviving Corporation, or a subsidiary through the applicable payment date; provided, that, if such holder
experiences a qualifying termination, any unpaid amount will be paid to the holder within 30 days of such
termination.
For an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the Merger
occurs on March 10, 2023, and each of the named executive officers experiences a qualifying termination on
that date, see “- Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Maxar’s Named Executive Officers” below. We
estimate that the value of unvested equity awards held by all executive officers, other than the named
executive officers, that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs on March 10, 2023, and all such
executive officers experience qualifying terminations on that date is $12,931,998. We estimate that the
aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Maxar that would vest
assuming that the Merger occurs on March 10, 2023 is $2,076,540.
Executive Severance Arrangements
Daniel L. Jablonsky
Maxar is party to an amended and restated employment agreement with Daniel L. Jablonsky (the
“Jablonsky Agreement”). Pursuant to the Jablonsky Agreement, if Mr. Jablonsky experiences a qualifying
termination during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months following a change in
control, he will be entitled to (1) severance equal to 2.99 times the sum of his then-current base salary plus
his target annual bonus for the year of termination, generally payable in a lump sum, (2) accelerated vesting
of Mr. Jablonsky’s outstanding equity awards, with any performance conditions calculated based upon the
higher of actual achievement and prorated target achievement, (3) up to 36 months of continued health
coverage for Mr. Jablonsky and his dependents under Maxar’s group health plan, or reimbursement for such
costs, and (4) “executive package” outplacement services. The foregoing payments are conditional on Mr.
Jablonsky’s executing and not revoking a release of claims agreement with Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky is
prohibited for a period of one year following termination of employment from competing with Maxar and
soliciting Maxar’s employees.
Messrs. Porter, Scott, Frazier and Lee
Each of Messrs. Porter, Scott, Frazier and Lee is party to a change in control and severance agreement
with Maxar. These agreements provide that, in the case of Messrs. Frazier and Lee, in the event of a
qualifying termination during the period beginning three months before and ending 24 months following a
change in control of Maxar, and, in the case of Messrs. Porter and Scott, in the event of a qualifying
termination on or during 24 months following a change in control, the executive officer will be entitled to (1)
severance equal to two times the sum of the executive’s then-current base salary plus his target annual
bonus for the year of termination, generally payable in a lump sum, (2) a lump sum payment equal to 24
months of continued COBRA premiums, (3) “executive package” outplacement services, and (4) accelerated
vesting of the executive’s outstanding equity awards; provided, that, Mr. Porter is only eligible for
accelerated vesting if he experiences a qualifying termination within the first 12 months following a change in
control. The foregoing payments are conditional on the executive executing and not revoking a release of
claims agreement with Maxar. Each of Messrs. Porter, Scott, Frazier and Lee is prohibited for a period of one
year following termination of employment from competing with Maxar and soliciting Maxar’s employees.
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments described above that would be payable to
Maxar’s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination on March 10, 2023, see “- Quantification of
Payments and Benefits to Maxar’s Named Executive Officers” below. We estimate that the aggregate value of
severance payments that would be payable to all Maxar executive officers who are not named executive
officers, assuming a qualifying termination on March 10, 2023, is $21,702,338.
Retention Awards
In connection with the Merger, Maxar awarded each named executive officer a one-time cash retention
bonus. Maxar awarded Mr. Jablonsky a retention bonus of $1,500,000, Mr. Frazier a retention bonus of
57 
(1) 
a) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
$700,000, Mr. Lee a retention bonus of $650,000, Mr. Porter a retention bonus of $500,000 and Mr. Scott a
retention bonus of $300,000. Each retention bonus will vest with respect to one third of the award upon the
Effective Time and with respect to the remaining two thirds of the award on the one year anniversary of the
Effective Time, subject to the recipient’s continued employment through the applicable vesting date (or such
recipient’s earlier qualifying termination). The estimated aggregate amount of retention bonuses that will be
payable to all Maxar executive officers who are not named executive officers is $1,390,000.
Indemnification Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Maxar’s directors and executive officers will be entitled
to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the effective time under
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and
insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification and
Insurance.”
New Compensation Arrangements
Any executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are
retained to provide services to the Surviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation
arrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent,
any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation
arrangements between such persons and the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been
established or discussed.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Maxar’s Named Executive Officers
The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Maxar’s named executive
officers would receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and
each such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination on March 10, 2023 (which is the
assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); (ii) a per share price of
Maxar ordinary shares of $53; (iii) that each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target
bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement; and (iv) equity awards
that are outstanding as of March 10, 2023. The calculations in the table below do not include any amounts
that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In
addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may
occur prior to the Effective Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to
March 10, 2023. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual
amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth
below.

the COBRA premiums for the executive for the 24 months following the termination and (4) outplacement
services at Maxar’s cost.
Each of the named executive officers must sign a release of claims against Maxar, and each of the
named executive officers is prohibited for a period of one year following termination of employment from
competing with Maxar and soliciting Maxar’s employees.
Cash Retention
In connection with the Merger, each named executive officer received a one-time cash-based
retention bonus in the following amounts. Each retention bonus will vest with respect to one third of
the award upon the Effective Time and with respect to the remaining two thirds of the award on the one
year anniversary of the Effective Time, subject to the recipient’s continued employment through the
applicable vesting date (or such recipient’s earlier qualifying termination).

Each Maxar SAR that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the
product of (a) the number of Maxar common stock shares subject to such Maxar SAR as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Maxar ordinary share subject to such Maxar SAR as of the Effective Time.
Each Maxar RSU and PSU Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the
number of Maxar common stock shares subject to such Maxar RSU or PSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of clause (a) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the number of Maxar common stock shares subject to a Maxar PSU
Award will be based on 175% achievement of target performance for PSU Awards granted in 2020, 176%
achievement of target performance for PSU Awards granted in 2021, and 184% achievement of target
performance for PSU Awards granted in 2022.
Two thirds of the cash payment received in exchange for the 2023 Employee RSUs will vest and be
payable in roughly equal installments on January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, subject to the named
executive officer’s continued employment with Maxar, the Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary
through the applicable payment date; provided, that, in the event the holder of such 2023 Employee
RSUs experiences a qualifying termination, any unvested amount will be paid to the holder within 30
days of such termination. Payment of the remaining third of the cash payment received in exchange for
the 2023 Employee RSUs will be made within 10 business days following the Effective Time.

Letter and the Equity Commitment Letters, and Preferred Equity Issuer has delivered to Maxar a copy of the
Preferred Equity Commitment Letter.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Equity
Financing Sources have committed to capitalize Parent at the Closing with an aggregate equity contribution
equal to approximately $4.1 billion for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. The obligations of each
Equity Financing Source to provide the Equity Financing under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter are
subject only to the following conditions: (a) the satisfaction in full, or waiver by Parent, of each of the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions set forth in the
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), (b) no party having validly terminated the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, (c) Maxar’s confirmation in writing that if each of the Equity
Financing, the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing are funded (including any Alternative
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that has been obtained in accordance
with, and satisfies the conditions of, the Merger Agreement), Maxar will take such actions that are required
of it by the Merger Agreement to consummate the Closing, (d) each of the Debt Financing and Preferred
Equity Financing have been funded or will be funded, in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable, if the

Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (e) the prior or substantially concurrent funding of each
Equity Financing Source’s equity commitment under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter.
The obligation of each Equity Financing Source to fund its equity commitment will automatically and
immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the Closing, (b) the valid termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, (c) the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to
the Guarantee and (d) the commencement by Maxar or any of its controlled affiliates of any lawsuit asserting
any claim pursuant to its Equity Commitment Letter (other than certain retained claims).
Maxar is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to (i)
requiring Maxar’s consent to any amendment or modification of the Equity Commitment Letters and (ii) the
rights granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letters, such that Maxar is entitled to specifically
enforce the obligations of each Equity Financing Source (and any of their respective successors or assigns)
under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter through an action for specific performance, in each case
without a requirement that such enforcement be at the direction of Parent and subject to (a) the limitations
and conditions set forth in each Equity Commitment Letter and (b) the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement.
Debt Financing and Preferred Equity Financing
In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, (a) the Lender Parties have committed to provide
Parent with Debt Financing and (b) Parent has obtained commitments for Preferred Equity Financing,
together in an aggregate principal amount that is sufficient, when taken together with the Equity Financing,
to pay the Required Amounts. The obligations of the Lender Parties to provide Debt Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter, and the obligations of the Preferred Equity Investor Parties to provide Preferred
Equity Financing under the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, in each case, are subject to a number of
customary conditions, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Debt Financing
and Preferred Equity Financing.”
Guarantee
Pursuant to the Guarantee, the Equity Financing Sources have agreed to severally (but not jointly, or
jointly and severally) guarantee the due, punctual and complete payment, performance and discharge of
either of the following mutually exclusive obligations: (a) the obligation of Parent to pay, or to provide
adequate funds for the payment to Maxar of, (1) certain indemnification and reimbursement obligations
solely if and when payable by Parent to Maxar and its representatives in connection with arrangement of the
Debt Financing and certain other fees and expenses payable by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
plus (2) an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee (plus certain enforcement expenses payable by
Parent), solely if and when any of the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
or (b) the obligation of Parent to fund an amount equal to the Equity Contribution in the event, and only in
the event, that specific performance with respect to Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded by Parent and to consummate the Closing is awarded against Parent pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, subject in all respects to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the
Guarantee, the Merger Agreement, or any other agreement to the contrary, Maxar has agreed that in no event
is any Equity Financing Source required to pay any amount to Maxar or any affiliate thereof under, in respect
of, or in connection with the Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement, in excess of, in the
case of amounts paid with respect to clause (a) of the Guaranteed Obligations, the pro rata portion of such
Equity Financing Source with respect to such amounts and with respect to clause (b) of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the pro rata portion of such Equity Financing Source of the Equity Contribution.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest of:

If the Merger is consummated, Maxar stockholders who continuously hold shares of Maxar common
stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly
demand appraisal of their shares and otherwise comply with the statutory requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the
DGCL. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under
the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any
legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Maxar stockholders exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder,”
“holder of shares of Maxar common stock” or “Maxar stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of
Maxar common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Maxar
common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person
having a beneficial interest in shares of Maxar common stock held of record in the name of another person,
such as a bank, broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or custodian), depository or other nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely
manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Maxar common stock through a bank, broker or other
nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, Maxar stockholders who: (a) submit a written demand for
appraisal of their shares; (b) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (c) continuously
are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (d) otherwise exactly follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Maxar common stock, exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest
to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss
appraisal proceedings as to all Maxar stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless (i) the total
number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of Maxar common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262;
62 • 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Maxar common stock for
which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (i) and (ii) which are
referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any
time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving
Corporation may voluntarily pay to each Maxar stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant
to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only
on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the
shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time
of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation
to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, such as
the Special Meeting, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which
appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section
262. This proxy statement constitutes Maxar’s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.
In connection with the Merger, any Maxar stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who
wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review this discussion and Annex C carefully. Failure
to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss
of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Maxar stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the
complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Maxar common stock,
Maxar believes that if a Maxar stockholder considers exercising such rights, that Maxar stockholder should
seek the advice of legal counsel.
Maxar stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Maxar common
stock must do ALL of the following:
the Maxar stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal;
the Maxar stockholder must deliver to Maxar a written demand for appraisal before the vote by the
Maxar stockholders is taken on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting;
the Maxar stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Maxar common stock from the date of
making the demand through the Effective Time (a Maxar stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the
Maxar stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
the Maxar stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Maxar common stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation
must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of
the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation
to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, a Maxar stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its
shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any Maxar stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Maxar, before the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will be submitted to Maxar stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such Maxar
stockholder’s shares, and that Maxar stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of
63 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Merger Agreement. A Maxar stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on
the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the
Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be
voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the Maxar
stockholder’s appraisal rights. Therefore, a Maxar stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the
Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or
failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written
demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in
addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A Maxar stockholder’s failure to
make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting of Maxar stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Maxar common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the
shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Maxar common stock
must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Maxar of the identity
of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in
connection with the Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such
as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner,
and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common,
the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an
authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of
record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
MAXAR STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR
OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT
WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES TO MAKE A DEMAND
FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD
OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE,
MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be in writing and should be mailed or
delivered to:

Westminster, Colorado 80234
At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Maxar stockholder who has delivered a written
demand to Maxar and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to
Maxar a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand
made more than 60 days after the Effective Time shall require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any Maxar stockholder
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect
the right of any Maxar stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such Maxar stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
Merger Consideration within 60 days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and
Maxar, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when
that approval is required, or, except with respect to any Maxar stockholder who
64 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with
respect to a Maxar stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value
determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the
Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify
each Maxar stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and
who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective
and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any Maxar
stockholder who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including
for this purpose any beneficial owner of shares of Maxar common stock held either in a voting trust or by
nominee on behalf of such person) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed
by a Maxar stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held
by all dissenting Maxar stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation,
and has no present intention, to file a petition, and Maxar stockholders should not assume that the Surviving
Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of
Maxar common stock. Accordingly, any Maxar stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised
should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Maxar
common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a Maxar
stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the Maxar
stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any Maxar stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written
request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
of Maxar common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to
which Maxar has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The
Surviving Corporation must mail such statement to the requesting Maxar stockholder within 10 days after
receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares
of Maxar common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement
described in this paragraph. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a
Maxar stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Maxar stockholder or a beneficial owner and a copy
thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20
days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all Maxar stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition
be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the Maxar stockholders shown on such verified list at the
addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing
in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another
publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the
Surviving Corporation. After notice to Maxar stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those Maxar stockholders who
have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require Maxar stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to
65 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceedings and, if any Maxar stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may dismiss that Maxar stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Maxar stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights
unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of “Fair Value”
After determining the Maxar stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership
thresholds described above has been satisfied as to Maxar stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the
appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of Maxar common stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any,
to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 that
have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as described below). In determining fair value,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of
the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and
the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters
judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each Maxar stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment
only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the
shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time
of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this
determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects,
the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that
throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of
value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also
stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible
of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Maxar stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as
so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the
consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and
that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and Maxar stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Maxar nor Parent
anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Maxar stockholder exercising appraisal
rights, and each of Maxar and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262,
the “fair value” of a share of Maxar common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as
to Maxar stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of
experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a Maxar
stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by
a Maxar stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to be
appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any Maxar stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Maxar common stock under
Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the Maxar
stockholder’s shares of Maxar common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. A Maxar stockholder will fail to perfect,
or effectively lose or withdraw, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120
days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met or if the Maxar
stockholder properly delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder’s demand for
appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no Maxar stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be
entitled to vote such shares of Maxar common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Maxar
common stock, if any, payable to Maxar stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for
an appraisal is filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met, or if the Maxar
stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written
approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such Maxar stockholder to an appraisal will cease.
Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding
may not be dismissed as to any Maxar stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may
be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
affect the right of any Maxar stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such Maxar stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a
Maxar stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Maxar stockholder wishing to exercise
appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",71,76

In connection with the Merger Agreement, several complaints have been filed in federal court as
individual actions. The complaints are captioned as follows: (1) O’Dell v. Maxar Technologies Inc., et al., 23-
cv-00929 (filed February 3, 2023 in the Southern District of New York); (2) Johnson v. Maxar Technologies
Inc., et al., 23-cv-00383 (filed February 9, 2023 in the District of Colorado); (3) Zaczkiewicz v. Maxar
Technologies Inc., et al., 23-cv-00401 (filed February 10, 2023 in the District of Colorado); and (4) Jeweltex
Manufacturing Retirement Plan v. Maxar Technologies Inc., et al., 23-cv-00873 (filed February 27, 2023 in
the Northern District of California) (which we refer to collectively as the “Complaints”).
The Complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Maxar on January 31, 2023
in connection with Merger Agreement (the “Preliminary Proxy”) misrepresents and/or omits certain
purportedly material information. The Complaints assert violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against Maxar and the members of the Board of
Directors. The Complaints seek, among other things: (i) an injunction enjoining the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) rescission or rescissory
damages in the event the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are
consummated; (iii) direction that the defendants comply with the Exchange Act and disseminate a revised
Preliminary Proxy; (iv) direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a result of any
misconduct; (v) costs of the action, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees; and (vi) other relief
the court may deem just and proper. In addition to the Complaints, starting on February 6, 2023, purported
stockholders of Maxar sent demand letters (which we refer to as the “Demands,” and together with the

Proxy. One such letter additionally seeks corporate books and records in order to investigate alleged
wrongdoing by Maxar’s Board of Directors, Maxar’s executive officers and/or Maxar’s financial advisors in
connection with the Merger Agreement.
Maxar cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. Maxar management believes that the Matters are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent demands or filed
actions. If additional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different
allegations, Maxar will not necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.",76,77

The following is a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
that may be relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of shares of Maxar common stock whose shares of
Maxar common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is
limited to U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Maxar common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to, as amended, as the
“Code”) (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax
consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. Holders. This discussion is based upon the Code,
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this
proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements
and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or
that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this
discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has been
or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Maxar common
stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes
regardless of its source; or
a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of such trust and one or more “United States persons”  (within the meaning of the
Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly
elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light
of their particular facts and circumstances, or to Maxar stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, including, for example:
banks and other financial institutions;
mutual funds;
insurance companies;
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of
Maxar common stock;
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;

tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental
organizations and pension funds;
holders that hold shares of Maxar common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or
other integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S
corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in
such entities);
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Maxar common
stock (by vote or value);
holders that received their shares of Maxar common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a
tax-qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
holders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
holders subject to any applicable minimum tax;
holders exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL; and
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Maxar
common stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial
statement.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the
income tax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income
or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising
under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 or any considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of
2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder and
intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith and any laws,
regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).
If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial
owner of shares of Maxar common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the
partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements
treated as partnerships holding shares of Maxar common stock, and any partners therein, should consult
their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY
PARTICULAR MAXAR STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE MAXAR STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR
TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Maxar common stock pursuant to the
Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for Maxar common stock pursuant to the Merger
will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received
in the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Maxar common stock surrendered
pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.
Holder paid for the shares of Maxar common stock. Any gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain
or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the
completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals,
currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital

General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other
confirmations from governmental entities as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger Agreement -  Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.” These approvals include clearances under
the HSR Act, the CFIUS Approval, the DCSA Approval; approval under the Communications Act; approval
under the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act; notification under Section 122.4 of the U.S. International Traffic
in Arms Regulations; and regulatory approvals under the laws of certain other jurisdictions.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is subject to the HSR Act. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed
until the expiration or termination of a 30-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act
notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) or the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”) issues a request for
additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) prior to the
expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would
begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting
period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. The parties made the
required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on December 30, 2022, and the initial 30-day waiting period expired
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 30, 2023.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration
of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust
70 TABLE OF CONTENTS
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of
the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold
separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the
completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or
desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action
under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger
will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties have received from the
interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which we refer to as “CFIUS”): (a) a
written determination from CFIUS to the effect that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
do not constitute a “covered transaction” pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 800.213, (b) a written determination from
CFIUS to the effect that review or investigation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
has been concluded and that a determination has been made that there are no unresolved national security
concerns and all action under the CFIUS laws has been concluded, or (c) following an investigation
conducted by CFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 800.507, CFIUS has reported the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement to the President of the United States and either (i) the President of the United States
has made a decision not to suspend or prohibit such transaction pursuant to his authorities under Section
721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, or (ii) the President of the United States has not taken any action
within 15 days from the date he received the report from CFIUS (which we refer to as the “CFIUS Approval”).
Maxar, Preferred Equity Issuer and BCI submitted a joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on February 14, 2023, and CFIUS
commenced its review of the joint voluntary notice on February 22, 2023.
In addition, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties have received from the Defense
Counterintelligence and Security Agency (which we refer to as “DCSA”) a written acknowledgement by
DCSA that it has accepted a proposed plan to mitigate any foreign ownership, control or influence with
respect to how Parent intends to govern and operate Maxar in accordance with the National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual, as codified at 32 C.F.R. Part 117 (which we refer to as the “DCSA
Approval”). The Merger cannot be completed until at least 60 days have elapsed since Maxar submitted a
notification to the U.S. Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (which we refer to as
“DDTC”) (pursuant to Section 122.4 of the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (which we refer to
as “ITAR”)). Such notification was submitted on January 16, 2023. The Merger is also subject to approval
from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (pursuant to the Communications Act) and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce (pursuant to the Land Remote
Sensing Policy Act).
Other Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions
(unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties to the Merger Agreement) under their
applicable regulatory laws as amended from time to time, in particular: Australia (pursuant to the Foreign
Acquisitions and Takeovers Act of 1975, as amended); Brazil (pursuant to Law No. 12529 of 2011); Canada
(pursuant to the Investment Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.28 (1st Supp.), as amended); Germany (pursuant to
the Act against Restraints of Competition); Saudi Arabia (pursuant to Royal decree No. M/75 of March 6,
2019); and the United Kingdom (pursuant to the National Security and Investment Act of 2021).
In each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to
consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have
agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make these filings as promptly
as practicable. The relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory
laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties
or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual
rights.

Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock
entitled to vote thereon is required for approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting,
(b) abstentions and (c) “broker non-votes”  (if any) will each have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal. Shares of Maxar common stock represented by properly executed, timely
received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a
Maxar stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the
shares of Maxar common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be voted as
recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Maxar) with a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Maxar to act as
paying agent in connection with the Merger (which we refer to as the “Paying Agent”). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, to be held in trust for
the benefit of the holders of the shares of Maxar common stock (other than Unconverted Shares), cash in
U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the
shares of Maxar common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Unconverted Shares) (which we refer to as the “Payment Fund”). The Paying Agent will invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger
Agreement. If for any reason (including investment losses) at any time the cash in the Payment Fund is
insufficient to make prompt payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent will
promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to such deficiency. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation, as Parent
directs.
Promptly after the Effective Time (and after receipt by the Paying Agent from Maxar’s transfer agent of
all information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent to effect the mailing, provided that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable best efforts to obtain such information to enable such
mailing to occur no later than the fifth business day following the Effective Time), Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an outstanding certificate (which
we refer to as a “Certificate”), if any, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Maxar common stock, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Maxar common stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled.
The Paying Agent will issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated shares of Maxar common stock
represented by book entry (which we refer to as “Book-Entry Shares”) not held, directly or indirectly,
through The Depository Trust Company (which we refer to as “DTC”), if any, the Merger Consideration for
each such Book-Entry Share, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), and such Book-Entry Shares will
then be cancelled. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held, directly or indirectly, through DTC, Parent and
Maxar will reasonably cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent, DTC, DTC’s nominees and
such other reasonably necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries, to the extent practicable, to enable
the Paying Agent to transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable after the Effective

Time, upon surrender of shares of Maxar common stock held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance
with DTC’s customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, Maxar, the
Paying Agent, DTC, DTC’s nominees and such other reasonably necessary or desirable third-party
intermediaries, the Merger Consideration to which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share will be properly transferred and that the person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer
and other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or will have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Paying Agent, of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. Until surrendered as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of shares of Maxar common stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, without any interest thereon. No
interest will be paid to or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. All cash paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Maxar
common stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Thereafter, such holders will be entitled to look to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.",84,85

Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Maxar and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
properly remitted to the applicable governmental authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of
the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent, Maxar or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.",85,85

As described in this proxy statement, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of
Directors has made the recommendation that the Maxar stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change (as defined below in this section of this proxy statement), except as described below.
The Board of Directors has agreed that, during the Pre-Closing Period, it will not:
fail to make, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw, qualify,
amend or modify) in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation that Maxar stockholders vote to
adopt the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”);
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend (or propose publicly to adopt, endorse, approve or
recommend) any Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit Maxar or one of its subsidiaries to execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
analogous agreement or contract which provides for, is intended to provide for or would reasonably
be expected to provide for, directly or indirectly, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement);
following public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal, fail to reaffirm the recommendation that Maxar
stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement within seven business days after Parent
reasonably requests in writing that such recommendation or determination be reaffirmed or, if earlier,

respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, except that Parent may make an additional request after
any material change in the terms of such Acquisition Proposal;
fail to include the recommendation that Maxar stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement in
the proxy statement; or
fail to publicly announce, within 10 business days after an Acquisition Proposal in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction structured as a tender offer or exchange offer relating to Maxar securities has
been commenced, a statement disclosing that the Board of Directors recommends rejection of such
tender or exchange offer.
At any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Maxar stockholders, the
Board of Directors may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, or, in certain specified circumstances,
terminate the Merger Agreement, if:
(A) Maxar has received an Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party that did not result from a
material breach of the provisions described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- No Shop
Period”; (B) such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn; (C) the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that, in light of such
Superior Proposal (and absent any further revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement), the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger
Agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law (it being understood and agreed that such determination in and of itself will not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change); (D) Maxar provides to Parent written notice (which we refer to

Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and advises Parent that the Board of Directors intends to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change absent revisions to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement that would cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal (it
being agreed that the provision of such Notice of Change will not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change); (E) during the period from the time a Notice of Change is provided until
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth business day immediately following the day on which
Maxar delivered such Notice of Change (which we refer to as the “Notice of Change Period”) (it being
understood and agreed that each material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including any revision in price or financing, in each case
during such two business day period will be deemed to constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and
will require a new written notice by Maxar to Parent in compliance with clause (E), except the Notice
of Change Period will be the two business day period from the date of such notice), if requested by
Parent, Maxar and its representatives engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
representatives, the intent and purpose of which is to amend the Merger Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change or the need to terminate the
Merger Agreement, as applicable; (F) at the end of the Notice of Change Period, such Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn, and the Board of Directors reaffirms in good faith after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the terms
of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause (E) or
otherwise) and (G) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement, as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; or
in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in this section of this proxy statement), only if: (A)
Maxar provides to Parent written notice, at least five business days prior to any meeting of the Board
of Directors at which the Board of Directors will consider whether such Intervening Event requires
the Board of Directors to take such action, specifying the date and time of such meeting and the
reasons for holding such meeting, including a reasonably detailed description of facts relating to the
underlying Intervening Event; (B) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change absent any revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;
(C) following such meeting, Maxar provides to Parent written notice (which we refer to as a “Notice of

Event is provided until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth business day immediately
following the day on which Maxar delivered such Notice of Intervening Event (which we refer to as

development with respect to an Intervening Event during such four business day period will require a
new written notice by Maxar to Parent in compliance with clause (C), except the Notice of Intervening

Parent, Maxar and its representatives have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend

Change; (E) the Board of Directors has considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of the

otherwise and (F) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (taking into account any changes to
the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by

specific terms or are otherwise breached (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of it
under the Merger Agreement in order to consummate the Merger Agreement). The parties have agreed that,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, they will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement and, in any action for specific
performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and waives any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement will not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives
any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.
Each party has also agreed that it will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other parties in
seeking and agreeing to an expedited schedule in any litigation seeking an injunction or order of specific
performance.
The parties have agreed that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this section of this proxy
statement, a party will not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to a party under the Merger Agreement (including monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of
the Merger Agreement or in the event that the Merger Agreement has been terminated or in the event that
the remedies provided for in this section of this proxy statement are not available or otherwise are not
granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this section of this proxy statement will require any party to institute
any proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance prior or as
a condition to exercising any termination right (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor will the
commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this section of this proxy statement or anything set forth
in this section of this proxy statement restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement or
pursue any other remedies under the Merger Agreement as are permitted by the Merger Agreement.
The parties have agreed that, subject to the limitations set forth in the next sentence, Maxar will be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and other related transaction documents (including to cause Parent to enforce its
right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters) subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and in the
Merger Agreement. The parties have also agreed that the right of Maxar to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be timely funded to fund a portion of the Required Financing Amount (but not the right of
Maxar to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) will
be subject to the requirements that: (i) all of the mutual Closing conditions and Closing conditions precedent
to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to close, as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “- Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” have been satisfied or waived by Parent (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions are capable of
being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time); (ii) Maxar has confirmed in writing that, if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing is
funded (including any Alternative Debt/Preferred Equity Financing that has been obtained in accordance
with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 4.13(c) of the Merger Agreement), Maxar will take such actions
that are required of it by the Merger Agreement to consummate the Closing; and (iii) the Debt/​Preferred
Equity Financing (or, if applicable, the Alternative Debt/Preferred Equity Financing that has been obtained in
accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 4.13(c) of the Merger Agreement) has been funded
or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing. Under no

Maxar Technologies Inc._20230316_DEFM14A_20730460_4617137.Pdf,PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Maxar is
required to submit a proposal to Maxar stockholders to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Maxar’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the
Compensation Proposal). This compensation is summarized in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement - Interests of Maxar’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.” The Board of
Directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation
information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, Maxar is asking you to approve the following
resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Maxar approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable to Maxar’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Interests of Maxar’s Executive Officers and Directors in
the Merger.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger
Agreement Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to
approve the Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is
advisory only, it will not be binding on Maxar. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved
and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Maxar common stock representing a majority of the
voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding)
basis, the Compensation Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting
will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal and (c) “broker non-votes”  (if any) will have no effect on
the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Maxar common stock represented by properly
executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated
thereon. If a Maxar stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such
proxy card, the shares of Maxar common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be
voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if
necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If Maxar stockholders approve
the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special
Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Maxar
stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had
received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that
the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on
the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to
votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting
if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Maxar common stock representing a majority of the
voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be voted as

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation
in any future meetings of Maxar stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, Maxar stockholders
will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
After the 2023 annual meeting of Maxar stockholders (which we refer to as the “2023 annual meeting”),
there will be no annual meetings of Maxar stockholders if the Merger is completed.
As described in our annual proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting of Maxar stockholders (which
we refer to as the “2022 annual meeting”), filed on March 31, 2022, Maxar stockholders had the opportunity
to submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the 2023 annual
meeting by submitting their proposals in writing to our Corporate Secretary in a timely manner as described
in the annual proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting.
In addition, our bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to business to be brought
before an annual meeting, including stockholder proposals not included in our proxy statement. For director
nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of Maxar stockholders by a
Maxar stockholder, such Maxar stockholder’s written notice must be delivered to Maxar’s Corporate
Secretary at the principal executive offices of Maxar not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to
the one-year anniversary of the immediately preceding year’s annual meeting. If the date of the annual
meeting of Maxar stockholders is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date,
or if no annual meeting of Maxar stockholders was held in the preceding year, notice by the Maxar
stockholder to be timely must be delivered to our Corporate Secretary not earlier than the 120th day prior to
such annual meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the 10th day
following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was first made by Maxar.

The Board of Directors 
Maxar Technologies Inc. 
1300 W 120  Avenue 
Westminster, CO 80234
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Maxar Technologies Inc. (the
“Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of
the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Galileo Parent, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), by and among the Company, the Acquiror, Acquiror’s
parent entity, Galileo Topco, Inc. (“Acquiror Parent”), and the Acquiror’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Galileo
Bidco, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in
treasury or owned by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (in each
case, other than any such shares of Company Common Stock held in a fiduciary, representative or other
capacity on behalf of third parties) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted
into the right to receive $53.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”), subject to and in accordance with the
Agreement.
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated December 15, 2022 of the
Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the
Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the
Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we
deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating
performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we
deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and
certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses
and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business and (vi) performed such
other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the
purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with
respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company,
the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we
believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or
otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or
completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation
to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any
valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company, the

insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of

assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be
consummated as described in the Agreement, and that the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material
respects from the draft
thTABLE OF CONTENTS
thereof furnished to us. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the
Company, the Acquiror Parent, the Acquiror and Merger Sub in the Agreement and the related agreements
are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax
experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues.
We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent
developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm
this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be
paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion
as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the
Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or
nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any
class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock
in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We note that we have not been authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any
other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of the Company or any other alternative transaction.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will
receive a fee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if
the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain
liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our
affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, for which we and such
affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as
joint lead bookrunner on the Company’s offering of debt securities in June 2022 and as joint lead bookrunner
on the Company’s credit facility in June 2022. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and
our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Advent International
Corporation (“Advent”), an affiliate of the Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner
on Advent’s offering of debt securities in February 2022, lead arranger on Advent’s credit facilities in March
2022 and financial advisor to Advent in connection with its acquisition, together with certain co-investors, of
McAfee Corp. in March 2022, as well as providing debt syndication, equity underwriting and financial
advisory services to Advent portfolio companies. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent
bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Advent portfolio companies, for which it receives
customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary
basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. In the ordinary course of our
businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company, the Acquiror or Advent and its
portfolio companies for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any
time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the
consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC.This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in

or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) such investments in all events shall
be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days, or
guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of, the United States of America. If for any reason
(including investment losses) at any time the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to make prompt

shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to such deficiency. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs.

transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificate in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying

to any equity incentive award to acquire the capital stock or shares, as applicable, of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except the right to receive the payment contemplated
by this Section 1.6 in cancellation and settlement thereof.
1.7 Exchange and Payment.
(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company (which may be the Company’s transfer agent) to act as paying agent in connection with
the Merger (the “Paying Agent”). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent, to be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of
Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares), cash in U.S. dollars in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled
Shares or Dissenting Shares) in accordance with this Section 1 (the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments of the Merger Consideration due
pursuant to this Section 1. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; provided that (i) no investment of such cash shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) such investments in all events shall
be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days, or
guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of, the United States of America. If for any reason
(including investment losses) at any time the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to make prompt
payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 1, Parent
shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to such deficiency. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs.
(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and after receipt by the Paying Agent from the Company’s
transfer agent of all information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent to effect the mailing
set forth in this Section 1.7; provided that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain such information to enable such mailing to occur no later than the fifth Business
Day following the Effective Time), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of an outstanding certificate (a “Certificate”), if any, that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificate in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the
A-4 TABLE OF CONTENTS
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
(c) The Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held, directly or indirectly, through
The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), if any, the Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry
Share, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held, directly or indirectly, through DTC, Parent and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent, DTC, DTC’s
nominees and such other reasonably necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries, to the extent
practicable, to enable the Paying Agent to transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of shares of Company Common Stock held of record by DTC or
its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as
agreed by Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, DTC, DTC’s nominees and such other reasonably
necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries, the Merger Consideration to which the beneficial
owners thereof are entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to this Section 1.
(d) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying
Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Paying Agent, of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.
(f) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, without any interest thereon. No interest will be paid to
or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
(g) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Section 1 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.
(h) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to
look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws and (y) if
such determination in clause (x) is made, the Company provides notice to Parent of such determination
within 24 hours thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of an unsolicited proposal, inquiry or

counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws;

result from a material breach of Section 4.4; (B) such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn;
(C) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and that, in light of such Superior Proposal (and absent any further revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(h), as applicable, would be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that such
determination in and of itself shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change); (D) the
Company provides to Parent written notice (“Notice of Change”) to the effect that the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor and

Company to Parent in compliance with clause (E), except the “Notice of Change Period” shall be the
two Business Day period from the date of such notice), if requested by Parent, the Company and
its Representatives engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives, the
intent and purpose of which is to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need
for such Adverse Recommendation Change or the need to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1(h), as applicable; (F) at the end of the Notice of Change Period, such Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn, and the Company Board reaffirms in good faith after

Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause (E) or
otherwise) and (G) the Company Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal,

delivered the Notice of Intervening Event (such period, the “Notice of Intervening Event Period” (it

stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; provided, that any such disclosure or communication
in each of clause (i) or (ii) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company
fails to expressly and publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure or
communication.
(e) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless earlier terminated in accordance

other party’s obligations under, any Financing Commitment, Closing Payments Letter or, to the extent

precedent to the receipt of any Financing to be funded on the Closing Date, (C) adversely affect the

Transactions on the Closing Date becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable (in each case, as such
terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and within the limits of, the “flex”
provisions contained in the Debt Closing Payments Letter), or (ii) the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or, to the extent entered into prior to the Closing Date, any of the

favorable, in any material respect, to the Preferred Equity Issuer or Parent, as applicable, than as set
forth in the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, in effect
as of the date hereof (assuming for purposes hereof that all “flex” provisions contained in the Debt
Closing Payments Letter have been exercised); provided, that nothing herein or in any other provision
of this Agreement shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or
construed to require, (aa) the Preferred Equity Issuer, Parent or any of their Affiliates to waive any term

financing, (dd) Parent or any of its Affiliates to seek any additional common equity financing or
commitments or (ee) the Preferred Equity Issuer or Parent to agree to any Alternative Debt/​Preferred
Equity Financing the terms of which violate or are prohibited by the terms of any other Financing (as in
effect on the date hereof). In the event that Alternative Debt/Preferred Equity Financing is arranged in
accordance with this Section 4.13(c), (A) the terms “Debt Commitment Letter” or “Preferred Equity
Commitment Letter,” as applicable, shall be deemed to include the commitment letters for such
Alternative Debt/Preferred Equity Financing (as amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in
accordance with Section 4.13(a)), (B) the terms “Debt Financing” or “Preferred Equity Financing,” as
applicable, shall be deemed to include such Alternative Debt/Preferred Equity Financing and (C) the
term “Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Sources” shall be deemed to include the lender parties or

event that Alternative Debt/Preferred Equity Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this Section
4.13(c), Parent and the Preferred Equity Issuer shall comply with the covenants and prohibitions in
Section 4.13(a) and Section 4.13(b) with respect to such Alternative Debt/​Preferred Equity Financing
and related commitment letters. Upon written request by the Company, Parent shall keep the Company

information pursuant to this Section 4.13 that would waive the protection of attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent has used its reasonable best efforts to disclose the substance of such information in a
way that would not waive such privilege (provided, that Parent shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, provide the Company with written notice that it is withholding

develop substitute arrangements that would not reasonably be expected to so result in the loss of
attorney-client or similar privilege).

Parent with the Required Information in Compliant form (provided that the filing of the financial

with the SEC will satisfy the delivery requirement of this clause) and (ii) to the extent Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Debt Financing (and, solely with respect to clauses (iv)(B)
and (vii) below, the Preferred Equity Financing), use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its

portion of such information that constitutes material, nonpublic information regarding the
Company Entities and (B) at the Closing, a solvency certificate in the forms required by the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood and agreed
that execution thereof will only be required of such officers of the Company who retain their

receipt of notice of termination of this Agreement; (y) in the case of clause (ii) of this Section
6.3(b), upon the consummation of the Acquisition Transaction and (z) in the case of clause (iii) of
this Section 6.3(b), prior to or concurrently with such termination.
(c) Parent Payment. If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section
6.1(g) or Section 6.1(i) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(b) and, in the case of this clause (ii), at
such time the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(g)
or Section 6.1(i), then Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company, in cash at the time
specified in the following sentence, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $249,000,000 (the “Parent
Termination Fee”). The Parent Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the fees and other provisions of this Section 6.3 are
an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement and the Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty,
but liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly, if

the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section
6.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences
a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any amount set
forth in this Section 6.3 or any portion thereof, the payor Party shall pay the payee Party its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or
portion thereof at the annual rate of the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Laws (collectively, the
“Enforcement Expenses”).
(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent or the Company, as applicable,
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more
than one occasion, whether or not such termination fee may be payable under more than one provision
of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. Nothing
in this Section 6.3(e) shall limit the obligations of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to pay any
amounts required to be paid by such Party under Section 6.3(a) in addition to any nonrefundable fee
required to be paid by such Party.
(f) Each of the Parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that if this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 6.1, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee, to the extent owed
pursuant to Section 6.3(b), and Enforcement Expenses (if any) pursuant to Section 6.3(d), if paid shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsors, the Preferred Equity
Issuer, any other Parent Related Parties and all other affected Persons against the Company Entities and
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, equityholders, members,
managers, Affiliates or Representatives (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) for all losses and
damages in respect of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Transactions, the termination of
this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable
Law arising out of any breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.3, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation to Parent or any other affected Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents, the Transactions or the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to
be consummated (except that the Company shall continue to be obligated to Parent for Enforcement
Expenses (if any) under Section 6.3(c)) and in such event, Parent and Merger Sub shall not seek to
recover any monetary damages or obtain equitable relief from any of the Company Related Parties.
(g) Each of the Parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that if this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 6.1, the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent
owed pursuant to Section 6.3(c), Enforcement Expenses (if any) pursuant to Section 6.3(d),
reimbursements and amounts payable under Section 4.9(c) and Section 4.13, if paid shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the other Company Entities, any other Company Related
Parties and all other affected Persons against Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsors, the Preferred Equity
Issuer, the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Entities and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, equityholders, members, managers, Affiliates or Representatives

The Board of Directors 
Maxar Technologies Inc. 
1300 W 120  Avenue 
Westminster, CO 80234
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Maxar Technologies Inc. (the
“Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of
the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Galileo Parent, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), by and among the Company, the Acquiror, Acquiror’s
parent entity, Galileo Topco, Inc. (“Acquiror Parent”), and the Acquiror’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Galileo
Bidco, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in
treasury or owned by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (in each
case, other than any such shares of Company Common Stock held in a fiduciary, representative or other
capacity on behalf of third parties) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted
into the right to receive $53.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”), subject to and in accordance with the
Agreement.
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated December 15, 2022 of the
Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the
Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the
Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we
deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating
performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we
deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and
certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses
and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business and (vi) performed such
other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the
purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with
respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company,
the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we
believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or
otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or
completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation
to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any
valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company, the
Acquiror Parent, the Acquiror or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express
no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also
assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be
consummated as described in the Agreement, and that the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material
respects from the draft
