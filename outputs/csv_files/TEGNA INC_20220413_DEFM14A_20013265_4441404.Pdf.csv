corporation and as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the

Act”), and TEGNA will no longer file periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”). If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. The time at which the Merger will become effective will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”) (the time of such filing and the acceptance for
record by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by TEGNA

TEGNA Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of TEGNA common stock (other than (i) shares of TEGNA
common stock owned by Parent or owned or held in treasury by the Company, except for shares of TEGNA common
stock held on behalf of third parties; (ii) shares of TEGNA common stock owned or held by any wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, except for shares of TEGNA common stock held on behalf of third parties; and (iii) held
by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented to
such adoption in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect to such adoption in
accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL, with respect to such shares (collectively, the
“Excluded Shares”)) will be automatically converted into the right to receive (i) $24.00 per share of TEGNA common
stock in cash, without interest (the “Base Per Share Merger Consideration”) plus (ii) (A) if the date on which the
closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) occurs (the “Closing Date”) after November 22, 2022, and before February 22,
2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.00166667 multiplied by (y) the number of calendar days elapsed after
November 22, 2022, to and including the Closing Date; (B) if the Closing Date occurs on or after February 22, 2023,
and before March 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.15333333 plus (y) (I) $0.0025 multiplied by (II) the
number of calendar days elapsed after February 22, 2023 to and including the Closing Date; (C) if the Closing Date
occurs on or after March 22, 2023, and before April 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.22333333 plus (y) (I)
$0.00333333 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed after March 22, 2023 to and including the Closing
Date; or (D) if the Closing Date occurs on or after April 22, 2023, and before May 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to
(x) $0.3266667 plus (y) (I) $0.00416667 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed after April 22, 2023 to
and including the Closing Date, in each case without interest (clause (ii) collectively, the “Per Share Ticking Fee,”
and, together with the Base Per Share Merger Consideration, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), in each case
less any applicable withholding taxes.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a designated payment agent a
cash amount that, when taken together with any cash which the Company will deposit with such payment agent at
the Effective Time (to the extent requested by Parent), is sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration for payment of each share of TEGNA common stock owned by each TEGNA stockholder. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and
Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of TEGNA common stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time (less any applicable
withholding taxes), but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares as
determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of TEGNA Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that each restricted stock award in respect of shares of TEGNA common stock (a
“Company Restricted Stock Award”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the
right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less amounts that are
required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each (i) time-based restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of
TEGNA common stock (a “Company RSU Award”) and (ii) performance-based restricted stock unit or performance
share award in respect of shares of TEGNA common stock (a “Company PSU Award”), in each case, whether vested
or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully vested and be converted into the
right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to
such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less
amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law. The number of shares of TEGNA common
stock subject to a Company PSU Award not granted in 2021 will be determined in accordance with the provisions of
the applicable award agreement, which generally provide that the number of shares is determined based on target
performance, unless the two-year performance period is complete as of the change in control, in which case the
number of shares is determined based on actual performance. The number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject
to each Company PSU Award granted in 2021 will equal the greater of (x) such number as determined in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable award agreement (as described in the immediately preceding sentence) and (y)
the number of shares that would be paid under such award assuming the Company’s actual performance versus
target performance for 2021 was also achieved for 2022.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each award of notional shares of TEGNA common stock under a deferred
compensation plan (a “Company Phantom Share Unit Award”) will be converted into the right to receive a cash
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock in respect of such Company
Phantom Share Unit Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less amounts that are required to be
withheld or deducted under applicable law.

The exchange of TEGNA common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
who exchanges shares of TEGNA common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of TEGNA common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by
such stockholder.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or other tax
consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law.
Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the
merger.

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, TEGNA stockholders who continuously hold shares of
TEGNA common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands
4TABLE OF CONTENTS
or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the
Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that TEGNA stockholders may be entitled to have their shares of
TEGNA common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair
value” of their shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as
determined by the court (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount
determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, TEGNA stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice
of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
TEGNA stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the consideration that
they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of TEGNA
common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, TEGNA stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to TEGNA before
the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold shares of TEGNA common stock of record
through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the
DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In
addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of TEGNA unless certain
stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by
Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of TEGNA common stock through a
bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker
or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by
your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights.”

As of April 12, 2022, six lawsuits have been filed by purported TEGNA stockholders in connection with the Merger.
On March 28, 2022, a purported TEGNA stockholder filed a lawsuit against TEGNA and the current members of the
Board of Directors of TEGNA (the “Board of Directors”) alleging that the preliminary proxy statement filed by TEGNA
on March 25, 2022 in connection with the Merger contained alleged material misstatements and/or omissions in
violation of federal law. The lawsuit is captioned Wang v. TEGNA Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02513, and is pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 29, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the
same defendants asserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned O’Dell v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02547, and
is also pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 30, 2022, two additional
lawsuits were filed against the same defendants asserting similar claims; the first lawsuit is captioned Waterman v.
TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-01789, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York;
the second lawsuit is captioned Landskroner v. TEGNA, Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02611, and was pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York until it was voluntarily dismissed on April 1, 2022. In addition, on
March 31, 2022, a fifth lawsuit was filed against the same defendants bringing similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned
Whitfield v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 2:22-cv-01247, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. Finally, on April 7, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants, also asserting similar
claims. The lawsuit is captioned Nutkis v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02894, and is pending in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by TEGNA on March 25, 2022 in
connection with the Merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial
projections of TEGNA, (ii) certain financial analyses of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill, (iii) the financial
5TABLE OF CONTENTS
benefits to TEGNA executives and members of the Board of Directors from the Merger and (iv) certain statements
concerning the sales process. Plaintiffs generally seek, among other things, to enjoin TEGNA from consummating the
Merger, or in the alternative, rescission of the Merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney’s fees.
TEGNA believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the
Merger may also be filed in the future.

obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap equal to $272 million,

The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of TEGNA and its stockholders; (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger; (iii) resolved to recommend that the TEGNA stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement; and
(iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the TEGNA stockholders
at the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof may change, qualify, modify, withhold, rescind or withdraw the foregoing
recommendation under certain circumstances in response to an Intervening Event or in connection with a Company
Superior Proposal (each as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-The
Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Recommendation Change”). However, the Board of
Directors cannot effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse
Recommendation Change”) unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not
limited to, negotiating with Parent and its representatives in good faith over a four-business day period, after which
the Board of Directors shall have determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. The termination of
the Merger Agreement by Parent in the event of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or by TEGNA
following the Board of Directors’ authorization for TEGNA to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an
alternative transaction contemplated by a Company Superior Proposal will result in the payment by TEGNA of a
termination fee of $163 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The

When considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, TEGNA stockholders should be aware that TEGNA’s executive officers and directors
may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, TEGNA stockholders more generally. In (1)
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, (2) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and (3)
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that these interests existed at the time. These interests
include:
•
accelerated vesting and settlement of TEGNA equity awards;
•
a prorated annual bonus in respect of the year in which the Closing or termination occurs;
•
potential severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the
Merger; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving
Corporation.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of TEGNA common stock held by TEGNA
executive officers and directors will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock
held by all other stockholders. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public

principle with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal; or (iv) authorize, commit or resolve to do any of the
foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, under certain specified circumstances, until the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by TEGNA’s stockholders, TEGNA may, among other things, provide information to, and engage or
participate in discussions or negotiations with, a person in respect of a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal if, subject to complying with certain procedures, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) that such Company Takeover
Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Proposals.”
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA’s stockholders, TEGNA is entitled to terminate the Merger
Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Company Superior Proposal if it complies
with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, giving Parent at least four business
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and at the end of such four-business day period,
considering any revisions to the Merger Agreement, so that such Company Superior Proposal no longer constitutes
a “Company Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended
pursuant to any such revisions.
The termination of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA in connection with the Board of Directors’ authorization for
TEGNA to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Company

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other
nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” and did not obtain a
control number, you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number to vote your
shares at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, consisting of
(i) the Base Per Share Merger Consideration of $24.00 in cash plus (ii) any applicable Per Share Ticking Fee in
cash, in each case less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of TEGNA common stock that you own
immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal
rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of TEGNA common stock, you will receive
approximately (i) $2,400.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of TEGNA common stock if the Closing occurs on
or before November 22, 2022; (ii) between $2,400.17 and $2,415.17 in cash in exchange for your shares of TEGNA
common stock if the Closing occurs after November 22, 2022, and before February 22, 2023; (iii) between
$2,415.33 and $2,422.08 in cash in exchange for your shares of TEGNA common stock if the Closing occurs on or
after February 22, 2023, and before March 22, 2023; (iv) between $2,422.33 and $2,432.33 in cash in exchange for

Closing occurs on or after April 22, 2023, and before May 22, 2023, in each case less any applicable withholding
taxes.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
A:
The exchange of TEGNA common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) who exchanges shares of TEGNA common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder
receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of TEGNA common stock
surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such stockholder.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or
other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you
of the merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock is required
to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of
each of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed
proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”); or (iii) vote
virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal
but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, the
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the
boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed
proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and
(3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of TEGNA common stock. Instead, TEGNA will remain
an independent public company, TEGNA common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and
registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, TEGNA will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $163 million, upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement-Termination Fees.”
Q:
Why are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require TEGNA to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote
with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger.
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on TEGNA. Therefore, if the
approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable
under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to TEGNA’s named executive officers in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects

envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the

Meeting”), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
Should I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and
written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of TEGNA common stock represented by such holder’s
certificates or book-entry shares for Per Share Merger Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of TEGNA common stock after the Record Date but
before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of TEGNA common stock after the Record Date
but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between
you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you

notifies TEGNA in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but
you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares of TEGNA common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy
card have been sent directly to you by TEGNA.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of TEGNA common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to
you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the virtual
Special Meeting. If you did not obtain a control number you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to
obtain a control number to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of TEGNA common stock are registered in your name
with Computershare, our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
Internet: Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is
available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on May 16, 2022. Once you enter the Internet
voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions. If you have any
questions about www.proxyvote.com, please contact the bank, broker, or other organization that holds
your shares.
•
Telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is
available 24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on May 16, 2022. Once you
enter the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or
change) your voting instructions.
•
Mail: If you received a proxy card, mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return
it in the postage-paid envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it
before 9:30 a.m. Eastern time on May 16, 2022.
•
At the Special Meeting: To vote during the Special Meeting, visit
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TGNA2022SM and enter the 16-digit control number included in
your proxy card. Online access to the Special Meeting will open approximately 15 minutes prior to the
start of the Special Meeting. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual Special Meeting
during the check-in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on
the virtual Special Meeting log-in page. Technical support will be available starting 15 minutes prior to
the Special Meeting. If you have questions about your control number, please contact the bank,
broker or other organization that holds your shares.
If your shares of TEGNA common stock are held “in street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee, the holder
of your shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form and directions on
how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the Internet or by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to
ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of
which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still
attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, if you have already voted by proxy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy
card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically
over the Internet or by telephone.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the Special Meeting. If you are the
record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:
•
You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the Internet, by
telephone or by mail, at any time before your proxy is exercised at the Special Meeting;
•
You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to TEGNA’s Secretary at 8350 Broad
Street, Suite 2000, Tysons, Virginia 22102, provided such written notice is received before your proxy
is exercised at the Special Meeting; or
•
You may attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat. Simply attending the virtual Special Meeting,
will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you hold your shares of TEGNA common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting by
entering the 16-digit control number included in your proxy card. If you have questions about your control
number, please contact the bank, broker or other organization that holds your shares. If you did not obtain a
control number, you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number to vote your
shares at the Special Meeting.
If you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:

Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of TEGNA common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of TEGNA common stock is
called a “proxy card.” David T. Lougee, our Chief Executive Officer, and Akin S. Harrison, our Senior Vice
President and General Counsel, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of substitution
and re-substitution.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?
A:
This means you own shares of TEGNA common stock that are registered under different names or are in more
than one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and other shares
through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive
multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions
for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares
you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by
mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
TEGNA intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following
the Special Meeting. All reports that TEGNA files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion
of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about TEGNA?
A:
TEGNA will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2021 Annual
Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,
without charge to any stockholder who makes a written request to our Secretary at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000,
Tysons, Virginia 22102. TEGNA’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed at
www.sec.gov or on TEGNA’s Investor website at https://investors.tegna.com/. TEGNA’s website address is
provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is
not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to
our website provided in this proxy statement.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address
with another stockholder?
A:
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for
proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single
proxy statement to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,”
potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
TEGNA and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials
to multiple stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been
received from the affected stockholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and
would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these
documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if
your shares are held in a brokerage account or TEGNA if you are a stockholder of record by sending a written
request to our Secretary at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000, Tysons, Virginia 22102. In addition, TEGNA will
promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the
proxy statement.
Q:
Who can help answer my questions?
A:
If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or the accompanying proxy statement,
would like additional copies of the accompanying proxy statement or need help voting your shares of TEGNA
common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:

TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement, and any document to which TEGNA refers in this proxy statement, contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Exchange Act, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable
laws. Such forward-looking statements include statements relating to TEGNA’s strategy, goals, future focus areas and
the value of the proposed transaction to TEGNA stockholders. These forward-looking statements are based on
TEGNA management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the forward-
looking statements were prepared or made, as applicable. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are
not historical facts and may be identified by terms such as “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “estimates,” “should,”
“could,” “outlook,” and “anticipates” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements,
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including the uncertainty associated with the potential
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on TEGNA’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental or regulatory approvals of the
Merger and the related transactions involving the parties that could cause the parties to terminate the
Merger Agreement;
•
risks related to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing the Merger (including the failure to obtain
necessary regulatory approvals (including the FCC Consent) or the approval of the Company’s
stockholders), and the related transactions involving the parties, in the anticipated timeframe or at all;
•
the risk that any announcements relating to the Merger could have adverse effects on the market price of
TEGNA common stock;
•
disruption from the Merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships,
including retaining and hiring key personnel and maintaining relationships with TEGNA’s customers,
distributors, vendors and others with whom it does business;
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the
Merger Agreement or the transactions involving the parties;
•
risks related to disruption of management’s attention from TEGNA’s ongoing business operations due to
the Merger;
•
significant transaction costs related to the Merger;
•
the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the Merger or unfavorable results from currently
pending litigation and proceedings or litigation and proceedings that could arise in the future;
•
other business effects, including the effects of industry, market, economic, political or regulatory
conditions;
•
information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network
disruptions, and cybersecurity, malware or ransomware attacks;
•
potential regulatory actions, changes in consumer behaviors and impacts on and modifications to TEGNA’s
operations and business relating thereto;
•
changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effect on our revenues, particularly our non-
advertising revenues, which could exacerbate any of the risks described above; and
•
such other risks and uncertainties described more fully in documents filed with or furnished to the SEC by
TEGNA, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022.

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal
executive offices located at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000, Tysons, Virginia 22102, during regular business hours for a
period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting, as well as on the Special Meeting website. The list will
also be available electronically during the Special Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TGNA2022SM
when you enter your 16-digit control number. As of the Record Date, there were 222,776,530 shares of TEGNA
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of TEGNA common stock outstanding
on the Record Date will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the
Special Meeting, it is expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock is required to
approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, 111,388,266 votes constitute a majority of the
outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a condition to
Closing.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve the Compensation Proposal.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
For stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention
will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “AGAINST” the
Compensation Proposal and “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
20TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called
“broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or
matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. TEGNA does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary
authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of TEGNA
common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote
your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy
card in advance by mail, through the Internet, or by telephone. Although TEGNA offers four different voting
methods, TEGNA encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as TEGNA believes they are the most cost-
effective methods. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the

cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over
the Internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to mail back your proxy card.

If you sign and return your signed proxy card without indicating how you want your shares of TEGNA common
stock to be voted with regard to a particular proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger
Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal on an
non-binding advisory basis, your shares of TEGNA common stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy
cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be
voted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee
or attending the Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number,
contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number so that you may vote. If such a service is

doing any of the following:
•
if a proxy was submitted by telephone or through the Internet, by submitting another proxy by telephone or
through the Internet, in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Voting at the Special Meeting” at any time before your proxy is exercised at the Special
Meeting;
•
by submitting a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares of TEGNA common stock;
•
by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to
TEGNA’s Secretary at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000, Tysons, Virginia 22102, stating that the proxy is
revoked, provided such written notice is received before your proxy is exercised at the Special Meeting; or
•
by attending the virtual Special Meeting and voting thereat (your attendance at the virtual Special Meeting
will not, by itself, revoke your proxy).
If you hold your shares of TEGNA common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the virtual Special Meeting with
your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number, by contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to
obtain a control number.

additional proxies, will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to

services in connection with the Special Meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail and email. Forms of proxies
and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians and other like parties to the beneficial
owners of shares of TEGNA common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of TEGNA common stock through the
Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means
that TEGNA stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for
appraisal, and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
their shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the
amount determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights,” on the difference
between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger
to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review
Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration
that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to TEGNA before the vote is
taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold your shares of TEGNA common stock of record through the
Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the
loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in
respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal.
The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger

Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of TEGNA common stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time (less any applicable
withholding taxes), but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly
exercise their appraisal rights will have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares as determined
pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see the section
of this proxy statement captioned “-Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of TEGNA Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that each Company Restricted Stock Award outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of TEGNA common stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award, in each case,
whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully vested and be
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
27

TEGNA common stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law. The number of
shares of TEGNA common stock subject to a Company PSU Award not granted in 2021 will be determined in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement, which generally provide that the number of shares
is determined based on target performance, unless the two-year performance period is complete as of the change in
control, in which case the number of shares is determined based on actual performance. The number of shares of
TEGNA common stock subject to each Company PSU Award granted in 2021 will equal the greater of (x) such number
as determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement (as described in the immediately
preceding sentence) and (y) the number of shares that would be paid under such award assuming the Company’s
actual performance versus target performance for 2021 was also achieved for 2022.

to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock in respect of such
Company Phantom Share Unit Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less amounts that are
required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law.
Background of the Merger",36,38
TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of TEGNA’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of
Directors and TEGNA’s senior management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, regularly reviews,
considers and assesses TEGNA’s strategic alternatives. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration
of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives. The
Board of Directors has also regularly engaged with TEGNA stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on
its strategic and financial direction. To assist in these evaluations, TEGNA regularly consults with J.P. Morgan and
Greenhill, its financial advisors, and other strategic advisors, as well as with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
(“Wachtell Lipton”) and Covington & Burling LLP (“Covington”), its legal advisors.
In August 2019, Standard General filed a beneficial ownership report on Schedule 13G with the SEC, reporting
beneficial ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.2% of TEGNA common stock. Subsequently, in
September 2019, Standard General filed a beneficial ownership report on Schedule 13D (the “Schedule 13D”) with the
SEC, reporting beneficial ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.8% of TEGNA common stock and
disclosing an intent to “become actively engaged” with TEGNA.
Between October and December 2019, members of the Board of the Directors and members of senior management
engaged in discussions and interviews with Mr. Kim, covering matters relating to corporate strategy, governance and
stockholder engagement and Mr. Kim’s request for a seat on the Board of Directors. Following these discussions, the
Board of Directors determined that it would not be advisable for Mr. Kim to be appointed to the Board of Directors at
this time, in part because of the Board of Directors’ view, in accordance with TEGNA’s Ethics Policy, that Mr. Kim had
conflicts of interest due to his and Standard General’s affiliation with Standard Media Group and MediaCo Holding,
two companies in the broadcasting industry.
Between January and April 2020, Standard General nominated four individuals - including Mr. Kim and Deborah
McDermott, the Chief Executive Officer of Standard Media - to the Board of Directors, and ran a proxy contest in
connection with such nominations.
On January 15, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial
ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.7% of TEGNA common stock.
On February 20, 2020, TEGNA received an informal, verbal offer from Party A, a broadcasting industry participant, to
potentially acquire TEGNA for $18.50 in cash and $1.50 in shares of Party A common stock, subject to due diligence.
Thereafter, the Board of Directors discussed this proposal with members of TEGNA senior management and financial
and legal advisors, and authorized management and advisors to enter discussions with Party A, including to
negotiate a non-disclosure agreement to facilitate Party A’s due diligence review of TEGNA.
Following various preliminary discussions over the prior year regarding the exploration of possible transactions,
including a possible combination of certain assets, between representatives of TEGNA and Apollo, on February 24,
2020, TEGNA entered into a reciprocal non-disclosure agreement with an affiliate of Apollo,
28TABLE OF CONTENTS
which contained a customary standstill restriction that allowed Apollo to submit confidential proposals to the Chief
Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board of Directors. Thereafter, TEGNA and Apollo provided due diligence
information to each other.
On February 28, 2020, TEGNA entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Party A, which contained a customary
standstill restriction with a customary “fall-away provision” that allowed Party A to submit confidential proposals to
the Board of Directors. Thereafter, TEGNA provided non-public due diligence information to Party A and engaged in
further discussions with Party A regarding a potential transaction.
On March 1, 2020, the Board of Directors held a meeting during which representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill
summarized Party A’s proposal, including the proposed purchase price. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill
also reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of its preliminary valuation analyses, including based on
management’s financial projections using a range of different assumptions, and answered questions from the
directors regarding the valuation analyses and management’s projections that were used as part of the analyses. In
addition, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill provided the Board of Directors with a summary of Party A’s
business and financial profile. Also during the meeting, the Board of Directors discussed TEGNA’s standalone
prospects and strategic plans, and provided guidance to management and the financial advisors with respect to
discussions with Party A.
On March 4, 2020, TEGNA received a revised proposal from Party A for a potential acquisition of TEGNA for $18.75 in
cash and $1.30 in shares of Party A common stock, subject to continued due diligence. The proposal stated that
committed debt financing would be provided by a specific financial institution and commitment letters were provided
to TEGNA in connection with such proposal.
On March 6, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Apollo in which Apollo offered to acquire TEGNA for
$20.00 per share in cash, with 100% of the equity financing to be provided by Apollo and debt financing to be
provided by internationally recognized leading financial institutions.
On March 7, 2020, TEGNA received a letter from Apollo, in which Apollo stated that it appreciated the information
that had been shared since the non-disclosure agreement was executed on February 24, 2020, and based on the due
diligence information received, including during calls with members of TEGNA’s management, Apollo was highly
confident that it could materially increase the proposed purchase price if given more access to due diligence
information.
On March 11, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Party B, a broadcasting industry participant, to acquire
TEGNA for $20.00 in cash per share, subject to completion of confirmatory due diligence. The proposal letter
indicated that Party B had identified 100% of the financing sources to support its proposal. However, the letter did
not disclose any information about the identity or type of these financing sources. Thereafter, TEGNA’s senior
management and financial advisors discussed with Party B its financing and acquisition structure and indicated to
Party B that TEGNA was willing to transact at the right price and was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure
agreement and provide non-public due diligence information if Party B could provide sufficient information regarding
its ability to finance the proposed acquisition of TEGNA.
On March 12, 2020, TEGNA received a letter from Apollo, in which Apollo reaffirmed its offer to acquire TEGNA for
$20.00 per share in cash. The proposal letter also included additional diligence requests that Apollo stated could
allow Apollo to increase the proposed purchase price. During the next two weeks, representatives of TEGNA
continued to provide Apollo with due diligence information and held a number of discussions with representatives of
Apollo. As a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, representatives of Apollo communicated to representatives
of TEGNA that the equity and debt markets were experiencing significant dislocations and therefore Apollo would
not pursue an acquisition of TEGNA at this time.
On March 17, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Party C, a consortium consisting of a private investment
firm and a broadcasting industry participant, to jointly acquire TEGNA for $20.00 per share, subject to due diligence.
The proposal letter indicated that the parties would obtain a commitment for all sources of financing and would utilize
its existing lender relationships to obtain committed debt financing, but the letter did not otherwise provide any
information on the specific equity or debt financing sources. Representatives of TEGNA discussed this proposal with
representatives of Party C but did not obtain any more specific information about Party C’s financing sources.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Throughout March 2020, the Board of Directors held a number of discussions, including with members of senior
management and financial and legal advisors, regarding the proposals received from and subsequent discussions
with Party A, Party B, Party C and Apollo, as well as TEGNA’s financial performance, standalone plan and the
changing market, financial and business environments, including as a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
Also during this period, TEGNA’s senior management and financial advisors discussed the proposals and feedback
on the proposals with each of the interested parties.
On March 21, 2020, TEGNA received a letter from Party A, in which Party A stated that given the then-current
economic upheaval, the dislocation in the capital markets, and the uncertainty as to the impact that these recent
developments will have on both businesses, Party A was not going to engage with TEGNA on deal discussions at
this time.
On March 29, 2020, TEGNA issued a press release stating that TEGNA had received four unsolicited acquisition
proposals in recent weeks and that TEGNA and its advisors engaged substantially with two of these parties and
provided them extensive non-public due diligence information. The press release further stated that these two parties
made their proposals shortly before the recent market dislocation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and both
subsequently informed TEGNA that they were ceasing discussions, and that the other two parties had not signed
confidentiality agreements to enable due diligence and have not delivered any information on financing sources.
Also, in the press release, Howard D. Elias, Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, among other things, that the
Board of Directors has been, and remains, willing to consider transactions that create compelling value.
On April 3, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial
ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 11.8% of TEGNA common stock.
At the annual meeting of TEGNA stockholders held on April 30, 2020, none of Standard General’s nominees were
elected to the Board of Directors.
On June 4, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial
ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.9% of TEGNA common stock.
On June 11, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial
ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 8.1% of TEGNA common stock.
During the summer and fall of 2020, members of senior management and advisors of TEGNA continued to have
periodic informal discussions with representatives of Apollo and Party A regarding potential transactions, and
members of senior management and advisors discussed these interactions with the Board of Directors, and also
discussed with the Board of Directors the financing market, acquisition rumors, potential valuations and the
regulatory environment. In addition, during this period, the Board of Directors continued to discuss TEGNA’s
financial performance, standalone plan and prospects and the changing market, financial and business environments,
including as to the significant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On October 13, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal from Apollo to acquire TEGNA for $16.00 in cash, subject to due
diligence.
At a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 27 and 28, 2020, the Board of Directors discussed and
reviewed, together with J.P. Morgan, Greenhill and Wachtell Lipton, Apollo’s proposal. Representatives of the
financial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of the financial projections for TEGNA prepared
by management at the direction of the Board of Directors to assist the Board of Directors in its review of a potential
transaction involving TEGNA. The forecasted financial information included management’s base case projections, as
well as an optimistic sensitivity case and a pessimistic sensitivity case that TEGNA management believed was
important to include given the heightened levels of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board of
Directors discussed TEGNA’s financial performance and standalone plan and the assumptions underlying the
different cases of projections that management prepared, including in the context of the historical and most recent
revenue and EBITDA trends for TEGNA, economic recovery from COVID-19, as well as industry changes and the
regulatory environment. The financial advisors also reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of preliminary
valuation analyses, including an analysis based on the different cases, and discussed with the Board of Directors
Apollo’s possible valuation methodology and the possible rationale behind the timing of the Apollo proposal and the
proposed consideration. Also during this meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of
Directors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
connection with the Apollo proposal. Following further discussion regarding possible responses to Apollo, whether
or not to approach other possible acquirers, the risk of leaks, regulatory considerations and risks inherent in a
transaction with Apollo and other parties, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the media industry and the
potential for continuing consolidation in the broadcast industry, the Board of Directors then authorized management
to communicate to Apollo that the proposed consideration was insufficient, but that TEGNA was willing to engage
and possibly provide additional due diligence materials to assist them in increasing the value of their proposal. The
Board of Directors also authorized management to reach out to Party A and certain other potential counterparties to
assess their interest in a potential transaction with TEGNA.
Thereafter, Dave Lougee, the Chief Executive Officer of TEGNA, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill
informed a representative of Apollo that its last offer was not sufficient, but that TEGNA was willing to provide
additional due diligence materials to assist them in increasing the value of their proposal. In addition, Mr. Lougee
contacted representatives of Party A and Mr. Elias contacted representatives of Party D (a broadcasting industry
participant) to assess their respective interest in a potential acquisition of, or business combination with, TEGNA.
Party A declined to further pursue a transaction with TEGNA at this time that involved a complete sale of TEGNA,
and Party D also declined to engage with TEGNA.
During November 2020, Party A’s advisors continued to have discussions with TEGNA’s advisors regarding
regulatory considerations relating to a transaction, with representatives of Party A noting that despite Party A’s
unwillingness to make a strong commitment to obtain regulatory approval, Party A was still interested in a potential
transaction of some variety, and the parties continued to discuss possible alternative transaction structures.
On November 2, 2020, TEGNA received a revised proposal from Apollo to acquire TEGNA at a price range of $16.50 to
$18.00 per share. The proposal letter also indicated that if Apollo were to receive access to targeted due diligence
information, they were confident that they could deliver a highly compelling proposal to TEGNA stockholders. Mr.
Lougee informed the Board of Directors of this revised proposal and thereafter communicated to representatives of
Apollo that the Board of Directors would consider it at its next meeting.
At a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on November 10, 2020, the Board of Directors discussed and
reviewed, together with its financial and legal advisors, the latest proposal from Apollo. Representatives of the
financial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of a preliminary valuation analyses, and discussed
the inputs of their analyses and related considerations. Also during this meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton
discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in connection with the
Apollo proposal. Members of the Board of Directors provided guidance to senior management and TEGNA’s
advisors with respect to the continued discussions with Apollo, which was thereafter communicated to Apollo,
including that Apollo’s latest proposal was inadequate.
On December 7, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal from Party A to acquire TEGNA’s station assets in fourteen
specified markets for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 to $2.9 billion.
At a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 8 and 9, 2020, the Board of Directors discussed and
reviewed, together with its financial and legal advisors, the status of discussions with each of Apollo and Party A
regarding a potential transaction with TEGNA and the terms of the latest proposals by each of the parties and
contemplated transaction structures, and that additional due diligence information continues to be provided to
Apollo. Representatives of the financial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of the financial
projections provided by TEGNA’s management, which were updated by management to reflect ongoing strong
performance of TEGNA’s business. The updated forecasted financial information also included management’s base
case projections, as well as an optimistic sensitivity case and a pessimistic sensitivity case prepared by TEGNA
management. The Board of Directors discussed the assumptions underlying these different cases, as well as
TEGNA’s continuing strong financial performance, and the expectation that such strong performance would continue
in the short term, but not necessarily in the long term. Representatives of the financial advisors also reviewed with
the Board of Directors a summary of preliminary valuation analyses, including analyses based on the different cases.
Members of the Board of Directors provided further guidance to senior management and TEGNA’s advisors with
respect to the continued discussions with Apollo and Party A, and it was subsequently communicated to Party A
that its latest proposal was inadequate.

for TEGNA’s financial performance and ongoing business trends. The financial advisors also reviewed with the Board
of Directors a summary of their respective preliminary valuation analyses, including analyses based on the different
cases, as well as TEGNA’s performance and standalone prospects. Based on such review, the Board of Directors

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In late June 2021, Mr. Kim contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Standard General
submitting an offer to acquire TEGNA. Following this discussion, Mr. Elias, members of TEGNA’s senior management
and representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed the possibility of Mr. Kim submitting a proposal to acquire TEGNA,
and representatives of J.P. Morgan were instructed to, and thereafter did, continue discussing this possibility with
Mr. Kim.
On July 12, 2021, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Standard General in which Standard General offered to
acquire TEGNA at a price per share in the range of $22.00 to $24.00, with the acquisition price to be refined in
connection with its due diligence review of TEGNA. The proposal letter further noted that the transaction would be
implemented with the support of a leading global private equity firm. The proposal letter also stated that Standard
General was prepared to execute a non-disclosure agreement with a customary standstill provision. Standard General
subsequently indicated to TEGNA that the private equity firm referenced in its letter was Apollo and that Standard
General had become aware of Apollo’s interest in TEGNA as a result of prior public disclosure that Apollo had
submitted transaction proposals to TEGNA.
At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on July 21 and 22, 2021, the Board of Directors discussed and reviewed,
together with its financial and legal advisors, the recent discussions with Standard General, Apollo and Party B, and
discussed and reviewed the proposal received from Standard General on July 12, 2021 and the status of the
negotiation of the non-disclosure agreement with Standard General, as well as possible next steps and negotiating
dynamics. Representatives of the financial advisors and senior management reviewed with the Board of Directors a
summary of the financial projections provided by TEGNA’s management. The forecasted financial information also
included management’s base case projections, as well as an optimistic sensitivity case and a pessimistic sensitivity
case prepared by TEGNA management. The Board of Directors discussed the assumptions underlying these different
cases. Representatives of the financial advisors also reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of preliminary
valuation analyses, including analyses based on the different cases. Members of the Board of Directors provided
further guidance to senior management and TEGNA’s advisors with respect to the continued discussions with
Standard General, Apollo and Party B, including with respect to the possibility that Standard General would work
with Apollo in connection with a potential transaction.
On July 23, 2021, TEGNA entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Standard General, which included a
customary standstill restricting Standard General from taking certain actions with respect to TEGNA and its
securities, but that permitted Standard General to make confidential proposals to the Board of Directors.
On July 24, 2021, TEGNA entered into an amendment to its non-disclosure agreement with Apollo entered into in
February 2020. The amendment extended the term of the initial non-disclosure agreement and permitted Apollo to
work with Standard General in connection with a potential transaction involving TEGNA.
On September 20, 2021, TEGNA received a proposal from Standard General and Apollo to acquire TEGNA for $22.00
in cash per share, outlining a structure in which Standard General would own 100% of the voting common stock and
funds managed by affiliates of Apollo would provide financing in the form of non-convertible, non-voting preferred
equity.
Also, on September 20, 2021, TEGNA received a proposal from Party B to acquire TEGNA for $23.00 in cash per share.
The proposal also included draft preferred equity financing documentation from one of the several potential preferred
equity sources of financing (while noting that Party B was still in discussions with several other preferred equity
financing sources), but no debt financing documentation was included in the proposal. Party B stated that it had
advanced discussions with various financing institutions to provide debt financing.
At a telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors held on September 28, 2021, which was attended by certain
members of TEGNA’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, Wachtell Lipton and Covington, the
Board of Directors discussed and reviewed the proposals from Standard General and Party B. Representatives of the
financial and legal advisors provided the Board of Directors with a summary of each proposal, including the
proposed consideration, required regulatory approvals, proposed timing, financing structure and commitments and
status of due diligence and other relevant information included in each proposal, as well as additional feedback
representatives of J.P. Morgan received from each party during follow-up calls with the principals and key financing
sources. Members of management also reported that Covington, as TEGNA’s regulatory counsel, would be
discussing the regulatory considerations of each proposal with the applicable party’s regulatory counsel.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At a telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 7, 2021, which was attended by certain members of
TEGNA’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, Wachtell Lipton and Covington, the Board of
Directors further discussed and reviewed the proposals from Standard General and Party B. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan provided the Board of Directors with an update on written responses that TEGNA had requested and
received from each of the parties relating to transaction structure, financing structure, regulatory efforts and other
significant issues. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law in connection with evaluating each of the proposals and other considerations in connection with
pursuing either a standalone strategy or a sale of TEGNA, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Covington
discussed antitrust and FCC considerations in connection with each of the proposals. Representatives of J.P. Morgan
and Greenhill then reviewed with the Board of Directors their respective summaries of their preliminary valuation
analyses, including summarizing how these analyses were different from the analyses summarized at prior meetings of
the Board of Directors, and answered questions from the directors regarding these valuation analyses. Directors,
members of management and the financial and legal advisors further discussed TEGNA’s potential strategic
alternatives and standalone plans, potential growth areas for TEGNA, and other opportunities that could be explored
by TEGNA, including potential joint ventures or other potential transaction structures, the actions being taken by
TEGNA’s peer broadcasting companies and TEGNA’s review of strategic options over the past few years.
At a telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 11, 2021, which was attended by TEGNA’s general
counsel and representatives of Wachtell Lipton, the Board of Directors discussed TEGNA’s long-range plan, financial
performance, business trends and the current business and regulatory environment, including the expectation that
TEGNA’s strong performance would continue in the short term, but not necessarily in the long term. The Board of
Directors also discussed and came to the consensus that it would be beneficial for TEGNA and its stockholders to
continue evaluating and exploring the two proposals received from Standard General and Party B in order to
determine if such proposals were actionable and would maximize value to TEGNA stockholders. The Board of
Directors also discussed the possibility of soliciting additional proposals to acquire TEGNA, but noted that it was
public knowledge that TEGNA was evaluating acquisition proposals and that there was no impediment to any party
submitting a proposal. The Board of Directors also discussed the proposals from Standard General and Party B and
possible next steps with each of these parties. Following discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Mr. Elias, Mr.
Lougee and TEGNA’s management and advisors to take any actions necessary and appropriate to determine the
viability of each proposal and to maintain a robust process in order to maximize value for TEGNA stockholders,
including sending a draft merger agreement to the interested parties.
On October 25, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent an initial draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP (“Fried Frank”), Standard General’s legal advisors,
and also to Party B’s legal advisors.
At a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 27 and 28, 2021, the Board of Directors further
discussed and reviewed, together with representatives of TEGNA’s management, J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, Wachtell
Lipton and Covington, recent discussions with and the proposals from Standard General and Party B, including with
respect to their financing structures and potential regulatory approval considerations. Representatives of Wachtell
Lipton and Covington also discussed with the Board of Directors various aspects of a potential transaction with
Standard General or Party B, including with respect to the regulatory approvals and financing frameworks and
potential issues, and also summarized for the Board of Directors the material terms of the form of the draft merger
agreement that was provided to Standard General and Party B.
On November 2, 2021, representatives of Party B’s legal advisor sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton a markup of
the merger agreement.
On November 7, 2021, representatives of Fried Frank sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton a markup of the merger
agreement.
On November 9, 2021, Mr. Kim contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to provide an update on Standard General’s
financing structure and to express the view that they did not believe they would have issues obtaining regulatory
approvals and did not expect to be required to make any divestitures, but that in any case they would agree to a
“hell-or-high-water” regulatory efforts obligation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 12, 2021, representatives of Party B’s legal advisor sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton a further
revised markup of the merger agreement.
On November 15, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with representatives of Fried Frank certain
material issues in the markup of the draft merger agreement and provided to Fried Frank an issues list highlighting
those issues that TEGNA wanted specific responses to prior to further engagement, which included the amount and
triggers for the regulatory and financing termination fees, the regulatory efforts covenant, the duration of the outside
date and extensions, the financing “marketing period” length and start date, the definition of “material adverse effect”
and specific exceptions, the non-solicitation covenant and related exceptions and the interim operating covenants
and specific exceptions thereto in order for TEGNA to have flexibility to conduct its business prior to closing.
Also on November 15, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with representatives of Party B’s legal
advisor certain material issues in the markup of the draft merger agreement and provided them with an issues list
highlighting those issues that TEGNA wanted specific responses to prior to further engagement, which included
deletions of the regulatory and financing reverse termination fees, the regulatory efforts covenant, the duration of the
outside date and extensions, the definition of “material adverse effect” and specific exceptions, the non-solicitation
covenant and related exceptions and the interim operating covenants and specific exceptions thereto in order for
TEGNA to have flexibility to conduct its business prior to closing.
On November 18, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of Party
B’s financing efforts and timeline for submitting a revised proposal. Representatives of Party B indicated that they
were progressing their financing work and expected to submit a revised proposal on November 22, 2021.
On November 21, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of Party’s
B financing efforts, with representatives of Party B indicating that the financing was secured and that a revised
proposal and response on the merger agreement terms was still expected by Party B to be delivered to TEGNA on
November 22, 2021. Representatives of Party B asked about the importance of regulatory and financing reverse
termination fees to any deal, and representatives of J.P. Morgan stated that the Board of Directors is highly focused
on deal certainty, and reverse termination fees are an essential component of being comfortable with the level of
certainty for any transaction.
On November 23, 2021, TEGNA received a revised proposal letter from Standard General to acquire TEGNA for $22.65
in cash per share of TEGNA common stock, with non-voting preferred equity financing from Apollo. The revised
proposal letter included executed commitments from the debt financing sources. The revised proposal letter also
stated that Standard General would agree to a “hell-or-high water” regulatory covenant and agree to a regulatory
reverse termination fee. In addition, the proposal package also included responses to TEGNA’s high-level issues list
that was sent to representatives of Fried Frank on November 15, 2021. Thereafter, following Mr. Elias’ direction,
representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated to Mr. Kim that the proposal letter was sent to the Board of Directors
and it would be discussed, but that the expectation is that the Board of Directors will be disappointed with the
modest movement in the proposed price.
Also, on November 23, 2021, Mr. Lougee contacted representatives of Party B to ask whether Party B intended to
submit a revised proposal on price and merger agreement issues and for Party B to provide an update on the status of
its equity and debt financing. Representatives of Party B indicated that they needed more time.
On November 28, 2021, representatives of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform them that Party
B and its financing sources had made good progress and that they expected to submit a revised proposal and
responses to the merger agreement issues by December 1, 2021, and on November 30, 2021 representatives of Party B
reiterated to representatives of J.P. Morgan that Party B still intended to submit a revised proposal as soon as
possible, but noted that it was taking longer than expected due to changes in the structure of the financing.
On December 1, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA’s management
and financial and legal advisors. During the meeting, representatives of the financial and legal advisors provided the
Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General (with non-voting preferred
equity financing from Apollo) and Party B, including the revised proposal from Standard General to acquire TEGNA
for $22.65 per share, subsequent communications between representatives

of J.P. Morgan and Standard General regarding TEGNA’s performance, valuation and the material terms of the draft
merger agreement. TEGNA’s management discussed with the Board of Directors TEGNA’s financial performance,
business trends and the updated forecasted financial information that was provided to TEGNA’s financial advisors
and the bidders, noting that management believed these updated forecasts should support a higher offer.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill then reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors their
respective updated preliminary valuation analyses, including based on the updated financial forecasts. The Board of
Directors then discussed with TEGNA’s management and financial and legal advisors the various aspects of
TEGNA’s valuation, standalone prospects and strategy for communicating TEGNA’s views on value to Standard
General.
On December 2, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed TEGNA’s views on value with Mr. Kim, including
explaining various analyses that corresponded to a higher per share price than offered by Standard General. Mr. Kim
responded that he would be prepared to pay more than the last offer of $22.65 per share, but that the advisors for
both parties would need to resolve the remaining open points in the merger agreement. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan noted that representatives of Wachtell Lipton would soon circulate a revised draft of the merger agreement.
On December 3, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the
merger agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to exchange drafts of the merger agreement and the ancillary
agreements through their respective legal advisors, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank, Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), Apollo’s legal advisor, Cooley LLP, regulatory counsel to Apollo,
Covington and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, regulatory counsel to Standard General, continued to discuss
the open issues in these agreements.
On December 4 and 5, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with certain equity financing sources for Party
B the status of the equity and debt financing for Party B’s proposal to acquire TEGNA, including various issues that
the financing sources and Party B were negotiating and the potential timeline for Party B to submit a fully financed
and actionable revised proposal to TEGNA.
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA’s management
and financial and legal advisors. During the meeting, representatives of TEGNA’s financial and legal advisors
provided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and Party B and
discussed various open issues with the directors. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton summarized and discussed
with the directors the significant open issues in the merger agreement, including the regulatory efforts covenant, the
amount and triggers for the regulatory and financing reverse termination fees, the “material adverse effect” definition
and exceptions and what actions would be permitted under the interim operating covenants. Following this
discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton summarized and discussed with the Board of
Directors Party B’s proposed terms and financing structure and associated risks.
On December 8, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with financial advisors of Standard General TEGNA’s
feedback on certain material terms in the merger agreement and views on the valuation that were communicated to Mr.
Kim on December 2, 2021. The representatives of the financial advisors for Standard General stated that while their
client has some flexibility on price and would be willing to move higher, they wanted more specific feedback on the
proposal.
Also on December 8, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of
Party B’s financing efforts.
On December 9, 2021, representatives of Standard General provided TEGNA with a letter in which Standard General
stated that its proposal to acquire TEGNA for $22.65 per share provided a compelling value opportunity for TEGNA
stockholders and that the terms of the draft merger agreement that Standard General was willing to accept were
favorable to TEGNA, including a “hell-or-high water” regulatory covenant to address any regulatory concerns, a
commitment on the part of CMG Media Corporation (“CMG”) (an Apollo portfolio company that owns Cox Media
Group) to cooperate with the regulatory approval process (which was one of the requirements that representatives of
TEGNA conveyed to representatives of Standard General) and a regulatory reverse termination fee of 4%. The letter
further stated that if TEGNA did not provide a response by 12:00 p.m. on December 13, 2021 in the form of a price at
which TEGNA would be prepared to transact, Standard General would be forced to conclude that TEGNA was
unwilling to engage in a transaction and would discontinue its pursuit of TEGNA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 12, 2021, following a discussion between representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Kim and Standard
General’s financial advisor, Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee, on behalf of TEGNA, sent a letter to Mr. Kim, informing Mr. Kim
that since the initial proposal to acquire TEGNA for a purchase price in the range of $22.00 to $24.00 per share,
TEGNA had reported strong earnings for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 and that many of the same
trends continued. The letter further stated that the Board of Directors would be prepared to transact at a price of
$25.00 per share, assuming the parties could resolve the remaining issues in the merger agreement.
On December 14, 2021, representatives of an equity financing source for Party B notified representatives of J.P.
Morgan that they and Party B did not reach an agreement on terms between them and as a result this financing
source would not proceed further as a financing source for Party B. Representatives of J.P. Morgan confirmed this
discussion with representatives of Party B on December 15, 2021. The representatives of Party B indicated that Party
B intended to seek to replace its equity financing sources and needed more time to submit a fully financed proposal.
On December 14, 2021, TEGNA’s, Standard General’s and Apollo’s legal advisors discussed various issues in the
merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the regulatory efforts covenant, representations
regarding regulatory matters, the regulatory reverse termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility for TEGNA to
conduct its business prior to the closing, including in connection with negotiations and entering into material
contracts, financing efforts and cooperation covenants, including a proposed “marketing period,” the definition of
“Company Material Adverse Effect” and exceptions, covenants regarding non-solicitation of alternative proposals,
closing conditions and termination rights and certain other issues.
On December 15, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed Mr. Kim and Standard General’s advisors that Mr.
Elias was prepared to meet with Mr. Kim to engage in continued negotiations on the transaction price and other
material deal terms if Standard General were prepared to materially increase its proposed purchase price towards
TEGNA’s last proposal of $25.00 per share. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also stated that prior to the meeting,
representatives of TEGNA, including Mr. Lougee, and its advisors would first need to discuss various issues in the
merger agreement with representatives and advisors of Standard General, including those related to operating
covenants and flexibility to enter into material contracts between signing and closing. The parties also discussed the
potential timeline of the contemplated transaction, and the possibility that the timeline to a potential signing would
likely extend into the beginning of 2022.
On December 16, 2021 and December 17, 2021, TEGNA’s, Standard General’s and Apollo’s representatives, including
legal advisors, continued to discuss various issues in the merger agreement and the other transaction documents,
and representatives of Wachtell Lipton circulated revised drafts of the merger agreement and the other transaction
documents to representatives of Fried Frank.
At a telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 19, 2021, Mr. Elias and members of management
provided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and Party B.
With respect to Standard General, Mr. Elias updated the Board of Directors on the letter sent to Mr. Kim on December
12, 2021, as well as on the open issues in the merger agreement, including the merger consideration negotiation and
the regulatory reverse termination fee issues. Members of the Board of Directors and TEGNA’s management
discussed TEGNA’s strategy for resolving any open issues on the merger agreement (including the price and the
possibility of proposing a “ticking fee” to both bridge any valuation gap and incentivize Standard General to proceed
more expeditiously towards a closing), ongoing work streams, proposed timing and the status of the financing
documentation, and members of the Board of Directors provided guidance to Mr. Elias and members of management
on certain of these matters and authorized them to continue negotiating with Standard General to resolve these
issues consistent with their guidance, including with respect to price. With respect to Party B, Mr. Elias updated the
Board on Party B’s financing efforts. Thereafter, on December 21, 2021 and December 22, 2021, representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Mr. Kim discussed the timing for the negotiations regarding the remaining open issues in the merger
agreement, including the merger consideration.
Also on December 21, 2021, TEGNA’s, Standard General’s and Apollo’s legal advisors discussed various issues in the
merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the regulatory efforts covenant,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
representations regarding regulatory matters, the regulatory reverse termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility
for TEGNA to conduct its business prior to the closing, including in connection with negotiations and entering into
material contracts, financing efforts and cooperation covenants, including a proposed “marketing period” and certain
other issues.
On December 25, 2021, representatives of Fried Frank circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Covington.
On December 27, 2021, representatives of TEGNA (including Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee), Standard General, Apollo,
Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank and Paul Weiss held several discussions regarding the open issues in the merger
agreement and the other transaction agreements, including the regulatory efforts covenant, the regulatory reverse
termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility for TEGNA to conduct its business prior to the closing, including in
connection with negotiations and entering into material contracts, and certain other issues. During this discussion,
Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee stressed that valuation, deal certainty and speed were critical elements for TEGNA, and
explained that while TEGNA believed in its standalone prospects, TEGNA was amenable to a transaction with terms
that would provide more value to TEGNA stockholders than its standalone prospects.
On December 28, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank and Paul Weiss continued to discuss certain
open issues in the merger agreement and the ancillary agreements, including the financing efforts and cooperation
covenants.
On January 3, 2022, TEGNA’s and Standard General’s advisors discussed the next steps in the potential transaction,
with Standard General’s advisors indicating that they were discussing with their financing sources the open points in
the merger agreement, particularly TEGNA’s position that the payment of the regulatory reverse termination fee
should not require a breach of the merger agreement. On January 7, 2022, Mr. Kim spoke to representatives of J.P.
Morgan regarding the proposed transaction during which they discussed the regulatory reverse termination fee and
the agreement on the hell-or-high water regulatory covenant. Mr. Kim further stated to representatives of J.P. Morgan
that he wanted to present an updated proposal to Mr. Elias directly, in which he would also propose a possible
compromise position on the regulatory reverse termination fee structure.
On January 8, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim spoke regarding the terms of the proposed transaction. During this
discussion, Mr. Kim offered a potential compromise structure in which Standard General would pay a lower regulatory
reverse termination fee if there was no breach of the merger agreement (for example, the parties failed to obtain the
required regulatory approvals by the Outside Date but fully complied with their obligations under the merger
agreement to obtain those regulatory approvals) and that there would be a higher regulatory reverse termination fee if
there was a material breach of the regulatory covenant. In terms of merger consideration, Mr. Kim stated that
Standard General was willing to increase the proposed purchase price to $23.65 per share if TEGNA were to accept
their position on the reverse termination fee construct, in which a breach would be required to trigger the payment of
any regulatory reverse termination fee. Alternatively, Standard General would pay the $22.65 per share previously
proposed but would agree to a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure, with Standard General paying
2% of TEGNA’s equity value in a no-breach scenario and there being a termination fee of 4% of TEGNA’s equity
value if there was a breach of the merger agreement. Following this discussion, Mr. Elias informed the Board of
Directors of this proposal.
On January 10, 2022, Mr. Kim contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss the proposed transaction. Mr. Kim
indicated that he had a productive discussion with Mr. Elias regarding the proposed merger consideration and the
regulatory reverse termination fee and a possible path forward through a bifurcated fee structure, and explained his
proposal to representatives of J.P. Morgan. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed Mr. Kim that they expected Mr.
Elias to revert soon with TEGNA’s response.
On January 11, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued their discussion of the transaction price and the structure and
amount of the regulatory reverse termination fee. During this discussion, Mr. Elias indicated that TEGNA would not
agree to a regulatory termination construct that required a breach for the payment of any fee. However, Mr. Elias
stated that TEGNA would be willing to proceed with the proposed transaction if the purchase price was $24.65 per
share, and would be prepared to accept a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure with a fee of 2.75%
of TEGNA’s equity value at the deal price if there was no breach of the merger
38

agreement, with the fee increasing to 5.5% if there was a breach of the merger agreement. Mr. Elias also explained that
TEGNA’s willingness to agree to a bifurcated fee structure was a significant concession and as a result Standard
General and Apollo would need to agree to the robust regulatory efforts covenant that TEGNA’s legal advisors were
negotiating.
On January 13, 2022, Mr. Kim communicated to Mr. Elias that Standard General would agree to proceed on the basis
of a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure but only if the purchase price for TEGNA was $23.10 and
the regulatory reverse termination fees were 2.25% of TEGNA’s equity value in a no-breach scenario and 4.5% of
TEGNA’s equity value in a breach scenario.
On January 14, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued their discussion of the transaction price and the structure and
amount of the regulatory reverse termination fee. During this discussion, Mr. Elias rejected Mr. Kim’s most recent
proposal and discussed with Mr. Kim TEGNA’s ongoing positive performance and views on valuation, and indicated
that if Standard General were to propose a price above $24.00 per share, TEGNA and its advisors would expeditiously
proceed to finalize negotiations on the remaining points.
Also on January 14, 2022, a representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform J.P. Morgan
that Party B’s stand-alone performance was improving and it was continuing to look for different structures and
financing alternatives to potentially acquire TEGNA.
On January 14, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA’s management and
financial and legal advisors. During the meeting, Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee provided the Board of Directors with an
update on the status of negotiations with Standard General, including the negotiations regarding the merger
consideration, the regulatory reverse termination fee (including the proposal by Standard General to bifurcate the
amount of this fee if there was a material breach of the regulatory efforts covenant) and the possibility of introducing
a “ticking fee” concept to bridge the valuation gap and incentivize Standard General to more expeditiously attempt to
obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction. Following discussions regarding these topics, Mr. Elias described to
the Board of Directors the recent outreach by Party B to representatives of J.P. Morgan. Also, during this meeting,
Mr. Lougee discussed with the Board of Directors TEGNA’s recent and expected financial performance and
discussions with distributors and provided a brief business and investor relations update.
On January 18, 2022, representatives of Party B and its financial advisor contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to
inform them that Party B was actively pursuing an updated financing package in order to submit a revised proposal to
acquire TEGNA and provided details on Party B’s potential updated financing structure.
Between January 18, 2022 and January 21, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued to negotiate the open issues in the
merger agreement and the ancillary agreements. During this period, Mr. Kim proposed to Mr. Elias merger
consideration of $23.70 in cash. Following discussion with TEGNA’s management and financial advisors, Mr. Elias
informed Mr. Kim that TEGNA would be prepared to agree to a transaction at $24.50 per share. Mr. Elias also indicated
that Standard General could agree to a “ticking fee” if the transaction was not consummated within nine months
following signing as a way to bridge the valuation gap and provide additional comfort to TEGNA on Standard
General’s efforts to consummate the closing on a more expedited timeline. In addition, Mr. Elias proposed that the
amount of the regulatory reverse termination fee be 2.5% of TEGNA’s equity value at the transaction price if there is
no breach of the merger agreement or 5% if there is a breach. Mr. Elias also proposed that the financing failure reverse
termination fee be 5% of TEGNA’s equity value at the transaction price. The following day, Mr. Kim provided to Mr.
Elias a further counteroffer of either $24.00 per share and no ticking fee, or $23.90 per share and a ticking fee of $0.10
cents per month starting nine months after the signing of the merger agreement. Mr. Elias indicated that he believed
that $24.00 would be acceptable but only (i) with the ticking fee of $0.05 per month starting after nine months, and
escalating to $0.15 per month after 12 months and (ii) if Standard General would accept TEGNA’s remaining positions
on the regulatory efforts covenant and certain other open issues. Mr. Kim stated that he would agree to this
construct but would need to seek approval from his financing sources.
On January 21, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting during which Mr. Elias provided the Board of
Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and its financing sources, including
that there was an agreement (subject to the approval of the Board of Directors) on the price of $24.00 per share and
the amount of the financing and regulatory reverse termination fees, and described the
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
remaining open issues in the merger agreement such as the regulatory efforts covenant and TEGNA’s “ticking fee”
proposal, which was being considered by Standard General and its financing sources. Members of the Board of
Directors indicated support for the terms that were negotiated. Mr. Elias also provided an update on interactions with
Party B.
On January 24, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction, with Mr. Kim
confirming the agreement on $24.00 per share and a “ticking fee” of $0.05 per month for the period between nine and
12 months following execution of definitive transaction documents, and also indicating that Standard General would
accept most of TEGNA’s requests on the regulatory efforts covenant and certain other open points. However, Mr.
Kim noted that the amount of the “ticking fee” after 12 months following signing remained an open item, but that he
was confident it would be resolved in due course. Based on this discussion, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim further agreed that
the parties and their advisors would expeditiously continue discussing and finalizing the transaction agreements.
On January 24, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the
merger agreement reflecting Mr. Elias’ and Mr. Kim’s agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to discuss and
exchange drafts of the merger agreement and the other transaction documents through February 21, 2022, including
negotiating the terms of the non-solicitation covenant, the regulatory efforts covenant, the restrictions on TEGNA’s
operations between signing and closing, the triggers for the regulatory reverse termination fees, TEGNA’s efforts to
assist Standard General in its financing efforts and certain other issues.
On January 31, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting during which Mr. Elias and representatives of
Wachtell Lipton provided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General
and its financing sources, noting that a summary of the current draft merger agreement and the other transaction
agreements had been provided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting. As part of this update, Mr. Elias again
described to the Board of Directors the terms that had been agreed with Standard General if the transaction was
ultimately approved by the Board of Directors, including (i) that the amount of the merger consideration would be
$24.00 per share, (ii) the amount of the “ticking fee” of $0.05 per month for the period between nine and 12 months
following execution of definitive transaction documents (with Mr. Elias noting that the amount of the “ticking fee” for
months 12 through 15 remained subject to further negotiation), and (iii) the amount of the financing and regulatory
reverse termination fees. Mr. Elias summarized for the Board of Directors the various work streams that were in
process with respect to the proposed transaction, including an update on Standard General’s efforts to obtain
additional preferred equity financing sources. Mr. Elias also discussed with the Board of Directors the potential
timeline to reaching the end of negotiations. Mr. Elias reported that TEGNA had not received any updates from Party
B. Mr. Lougee then described to the Board of Directors his discussions with Deborah A. McDermott, the CEO of
Standard Media, in which Mr. Lougee provided an in-depth overview of TEGNA and discussed the communications
plan for TEGNA and Standard Media if a transaction were to be announced.
On February 2, 2022, a representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to provide an update on its
efforts to obtain equity and debt financing for a possible acquisition of TEGNA, including that it was replacing
certain of its potential equity financing sources with others. The representative of Party B also indicated that Party B
now intended to submit a revised proposal within one to two weeks. Thereafter, on February 21, 2022, a
representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to indicate that Party B was progressing on its
efforts to obtain preferred financing and intended to soon submit to TEGNA a term sheet for the preferred equity
financing.
Between January 31, 2022 and February 9, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim and other representatives of the parties and
their respective advisors continued to discuss the open points in the merger agreement, the timing of the proposed
transaction, the status of the financing efforts being undertaken by Standard General, including additional preferred
equity financing sources that Apollo was seeking to have join the proposed transaction. During this period, the
parties also exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and other transaction documents.
On February 10, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim and other representatives of TEGNA and Standard General discussed
certain open issues in the merger agreement, including the amount of the “ticking fee,” the triggers for the higher
regulatory reverse termination fee, the regulatory efforts covenants and TEGNA’s flexibility to negotiate material
agreements in the interim period prior to closing, with the parties agreeing as part of these discussions on the amount
of the “ticking fee” to be set forth in the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Between February 11 and 21, 2022, representatives of the parties continued to negotiate the remaining open points in
the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the efforts required to obtain regulatory
approvals, the triggers for the payment of the higher regulatory reverse termination fee, TEGNA’s flexibility to
negotiate material agreements in the interim period prior to closing and the terms of the preferred equity commitment
letter and limited guarantee. During this period, the parties also exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and other
transaction documents.
On February 21, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting to discuss and consider whether to approve
TEGNA’s entry into definitive transaction documents providing for, among other things, the merger of TEGNA.
Representatives of senior management and advisors provided an overview of the proposed transaction’s final
economic terms, including the merger consideration of $24.00 per share, with a “ticking fee” of $0.00167 per share per
day (or $0.05 per month) if the Closing occurs between nine and 12 months following signing, increasing to $0.0025
per share per day (or $0.075 per month) if the Closing occurs between 12 and 13 months following signing, $0.00333
per share per day (or $0.10 per month) if the Closing occurs between 13 and 14 months following signing, and
$0.00417 per share per day (or $0.125 per month) if the closing occurs between 14 and 15 months following signing.
Representatives of the financial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors their final valuation analyses and
answered questions from the Board of Directors. Representatives of the financial advisors then rendered to the Board
of Directors their respective oral fairness opinions, which were subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date,
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other
matters considered in the preparation thereof as set forth in each such opinion, the $24.00 in cash, without interest, to
be received by TEGNA stockholders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with considering the approval of a potential sale of TEGNA.
Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then summarized the terms of the draft of the merger agreement and other
transaction documents, representatives of Covington discussed with the Board of Directors the regulatory approval
process for the proposed transaction, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Covington answered questions
from the Board of Directors regarding the transaction documents and the proposed transaction. The Board of
Directors thereafter discussed with TEGNA’s management and the financial and legal advisors their perspectives on
the proposed transaction, including that Party B had not submitted any updated proposal. After further discussion
and deliberation, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the other transaction
documents, the merger and the other transactions, and resolved to recommend that TEGNA stockholders adopt the
merger agreement.
Also on February 21, 2022, the board of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and CMG held a virtual meeting to discuss
and consider whether to approve the applicable Parent Restructuring Entities’ entry into definitive transaction
documents providing for, among other things, the merger of TEGNA. Early in the morning of February 22, 2022,
Parent’s, Merger Sub’s and CMG’s board of directors unanimously approved by written consent the merger
agreement and the other transaction documents, the merger and the other transactions.
Following approval by the respective boards of directors, early in the morning of February 22, 2022, the parties
executed the final transaction documents and issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.
On March 10, 2022, TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub, and, solely for purposes of certain provisions specified therein, the
other Parent Restructuring Entities, entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Amendment”). The
Amendment provides, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, that certain
regulatory efforts covenants will apply with respect to certain station transfers from Parent or an affiliate of Parent to
CMG or an affiliate of CMG that are contemplated to be consummated as of immediately following the Effective Time.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of TEGNA and its stockholders; (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger; (iii) resolved to recommend that the TEGNA stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement; and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by
the TEGNA stockholders at the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
(2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with TEGNA
management, Wachtell Lipton, Covington, J.P. Morgan and Greenhill. The Board of Directors considered a number of
factors, including those below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as
generally supporting its (i) approval of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA, the
performance by TEGNA of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation
of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) resolution to
recommend that the TEGNA stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL:
•
the current and historical market prices of TEGNA common stock, including the market performance of
TEGNA common stock relative to those of other participants in TEGNA’s industry and general market
indices, and the fact that the Base Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium of 39.0% over
TEGNA’s closing stock price of $17.26 on September 14, 2021 (the last trading day before market rumors
about the potential acquisition of TEGNA appeared in the media), a premium of 38.0% over TEGNA’s 20-
trading-day volume-weighted average share price through that date, and a premium of 11.0% over TEGNA’s
all-time high closing price since separation from the Gannett publishing business in 2015;
•
risks associated with continuing to operate TEGNA as a standalone broadcasting company, including risks
related to TEGNA’s long-term strategic plan, industry trends and changes in laws and regulations affecting
the broadcasting industry, including FCC regulatory, legislative or implementation initiatives that could
affect TEGNA’s operations and business condition;
•
the Board of Directors’ belief that TEGNA had engaged in an extensive and lengthy review of strategic
alternatives over the past two years, with the assistance of J.P. Morgan, Greenhill and other strategic
advisors, which explored solicited and unsolicited interest in potential transactions, both within and
adjacent to broadcasting, including with those parties that were believed to be the most able and willing to
transact, as more fully described above in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Background of
the Merger”;
•
the fact that the pool of potential acquirers of TEGNA could continue to decrease due to industry
consolidation trends and the potential for continuing regulatory constraints on ownership of television
stations and other media interests;
•
the belief of the Board of Directors, based upon the course of negotiations with Standard General (as more
fully described above in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Background of the Merger”), that
the Per Share Merger Consideration represents the highest price that Parent was willing to pay and that the
terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to the Company, in the aggregate, to
which Parent was willing to agree;
•
the Board of Director’s view as to the timing and likelihood of the consummation of the Merger, in light of
the required regulatory approvals, the commitments made by the Parent Restructuring Entities to obtain
such approvals (including the fact that the Parent Restructuring Entities are required to use
42TABLE OF CONTENTS
reasonable best efforts to take action in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals of the Merger, as
more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Other
Covenants-Efforts to Consummate the Merger”) and the conditions to Closing contained in the Merger
Agreement;
•
the view of the Board of Directors that the Per Share Merger Consideration was more favorable to TEGNA
stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives
reasonably available to TEGNA, based upon the Board of Directors’ extensive knowledge of TEGNA’s
business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, its competitive position and historical and
projected financial performance, and the belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration represented an
attractive and comparatively certain value for TEGNA stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects
for TEGNA on a standalone basis;
•
the financial analysis presentations of each of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill and the oral fairness opinions of
each of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of February 21,
2022, and based upon and subject to the various factors, qualifications, limitations and assumptions set
forth therein, $24.00 per share to be paid to TEGNA stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC” and “-",52,62
TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,"Opinion of Greenhill & Co., LLC","Opinion of Greenhill & Co., LLC
Pursuant to an engagement letter between TEGNA and Greenhill, TEGNA retained Greenhill as its financial advisor in
connection with the Merger.
At the meeting of the Board of Directors on February 21, 2022, Greenhill rendered its oral opinion to the Board of
Directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Greenhill in preparing its opinion, the
$24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock to be paid to the TEGNA stockholders in the Merger was fair, from
a financial point of view, to such stockholders. Greenhill has confirmed its February 21, 2022 oral opinion by
delivering its written opinion to the Board of Directors, dated February 22, 2022, that, as of such date, the $24.00 in
cash per share of TEGNA common stock to be paid to the TEGNA stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of Greenhill, dated February 22, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of Greenhill set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The TEGNA stockholders are
encouraged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Greenhill’s written opinion was addressed to the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for the purposes of its evaluation of the Merger, was directed only to fairness from a financial point of view to the
TEGNA stockholders of $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock and did not address any other aspect of
the Merger, including the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Greenhill expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of TEGNA or as to the underlying decision by TEGNA to engage in the Merger. Greenhill’s opinion
was approved by a fairness opinion committee. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any TEGNA
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, Greenhill, among other things:
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents;
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements of TEGNA;
•
reviewed certain other publicly available business and financial information relating to TEGNA;
•
reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts and other financial and operating data,
concerning TEGNA supplied to or discussed with Greenhill by the management of TEGNA, including
relevant financial forecasts relating to TEGNA as prepared by the management of TEGNA and approved for
Greenhill’s use by TEGNA (the “Forecasts”);
•
discussed the past and present operations and financial condition and the prospects of TEGNA with senior
executives of TEGNA;
•
reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for TEGNA common stock and analyzed its
implied valuation multiples;
•
compared the consideration comprised of $24.00 in cash per share with values for TEGNA common stock
derived based on the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain transactions that Greenhill
deemed relevant;
•
compared $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock with values for TEGNA common stock derived
based on certain financial information and trading valuations of certain publicly traded companies that
Greenhill deemed relevant;
•
compared $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA common stock to present values for TEGNA common stock
derived by discounting future cash flows and a terminal value for TEGNA at discount rates Greenhill
deemed appropriate;
•
participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of TEGNA and its legal advisors; and
•
performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Greenhill deemed appropriate.
52TABLE OF CONTENTS
In giving its opinion, Greenhill assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information and data publicly available, supplied or otherwise made available to, or reviewed by
or discussed with, Greenhill by TEGNA management. With respect to the Forecasts, Greenhill assumed that they were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and good-faith judgments of TEGNA
management, and Greenhill relied upon the Forecasts in arriving at Greenhill’s opinion. Greenhill expressed no opinion
with respect to the Forecasts or the assumptions upon which they are based. Greenhill did not make any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of TEGNA, nor was Greenhill furnished
with any such evaluation or appraisal. Greenhill assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and without waiver or modification of any terms or conditions the effect
of which would be in any way meaningful to Greenhill’s analysis. Greenhill further assumed that all governmental,
regulatory and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without
any effect on TEGNA or the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Greenhill is not a legal, regulatory,
accounting or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by TEGNA and the Parent and their respective advisors
with respect to such issues. Greenhill’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Greenhill as of, February 22, 2022. It should be
understood that subsequent developments may affect Greenhill’s opinion, and Greenhill does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
The projections furnished to Greenhill were prepared by TEGNA management. TEGNA does not publicly disclose
internal long-term forecasts or projections of the type provided to Greenhill in connection with Greenhill’s analysis of
the Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These projections were
based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of
TEGNA management, including, without limitation, the effect of regulatory, political and macroeconomic factors
which are inherently difficult to project. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in
such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please
refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Management Projections.”
Greenhill’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Greenhill as of, the date of such opinion. Greenhill’s opinion noted that subsequent
developments may affect Greenhill’s opinion and that Greenhill does not have any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm such opinion. Greenhill’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $24.00 in
cash per share of TEGNA common stock to be paid to TEGNA’s common stockholders in the Merger, and Greenhill
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors
or other constituencies of TEGNA or the underlying decision by TEGNA to engage in the Merger. Furthermore,
Greenhill expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the $24.00 in cash per share of TEGNA
common stock in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. Greenhill expressed no
opinion as to the price at which TEGNA common stock will trade at any future time. In addition, Greenhill expressed
no opinion on the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
The terms of the Merger Agreement were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between TEGNA and Parent,
and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. The opinion and
financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board of Directors in its evaluation of the
Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of Directors or management of TEGNA
with respect to the Merger or the Per Share Merger Consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, Greenhill employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the Board of Directors on February 21, 2022 and in the presentation delivered
to the Board of Directors on such date. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the
financial analyses used by Greenhill, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering
the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Greenhill’s
analyses.

Peer Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, Greenhill compared selected financial data of TEGNA
with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which Greenhill judged to be
sufficiently analogous to TEGNA. The companies selected by Greenhill were:
•
Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (“Nexstar”)
•
E.W. Scripps Company (“Scripps”)
•
Gray Television, Inc. (“Gray”)
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations
and businesses that, for purposes of Greenhill’s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar to those of TEGNA
based on business sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. None of the selected
companies reviewed is identical to TEGNA. Certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially
different from those of TEGNA. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect
the companies differently than they would affect TEGNA.
Using information obtained from the selected companies’ public filings, Wall Street research analyst estimates
available as of February 18, 2022 and FactSet Research Systems, Greenhill calculated for each selected company the
ratio of such company’s enterprise value (calculated as the market value of the applicable company’s common stock
on a fully diluted basis, plus any debt, minority interest and capitalized leases, less cash and cash equivalents) to (i)
an average of 2021 and 2022 Consensus Adj. EBITDA (defined as the consensus equity research analyst estimate for
such company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for various non-recurring
items), which Greenhill refers to as the 2021E-2022E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA and (ii) an average of 2022 and 2023
Consensus Adj. EBITDA, which Greenhill refers to as the 2022E-2023E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA. The following table
represents the results of this analysis:
Selected company

Based on the results of this analysis and other factors that Greenhill considered appropriate in its professional
judgment, Greenhill selected (i) a 2021E-2022E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA multiple reference range for TEGNA of 7.5x to
8.5x and (ii) a 2022E-2023E EV/Avg. Adj. EBITDA multiple reference range for TEGNA of 7.0x. to 8.0x. After applying
such range to the consensus forecasts of the estimates from publicly available research (the “Consensus Estimates
Case”), the Base Case and the Weighted Sensitivity Case (each of the Base Case and the Weighted Sensitivity Case,
as summarized in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Management Projections”), the analysis indicated
ranges of implied per share equity values as follows:

None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. Certain of these transactions may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of the Merger. However, the transactions selected were chosen
because the participants in and certain other aspects of the transactions, for purposes of Greenhill’s analysis, may be
considered similar to the participants in and aspects of the Merger. The analyses necessarily involved complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the Merger.
Based on the results of this analysis and other factors that Greenhill considered appropriate, Greenhill selected a
multiple reference range of 8.0x to 9.0x for the average adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and 2022 and 8.5x to 9.5x for the
average adjusted EBITDA in years 2020 and 2021. After applying such range to each of the cases listed below, the
analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the common stock of TEGNA as follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Greenhill conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining
the fully diluted equity value per share for TEGNA common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of
evaluating an asset using estimates of the future cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the
time value of money with respect to those cash flows by calculating the current value of the cash flows generated by
the asset, which we refer to as the present value and which is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the
present using a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the
opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. The present value of all future cash flows generated by the
asset for periods beyond the projections period is referred to as terminal value.
Greenhill conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity
value per share for TEGNA common stock. Greenhill calculated the unlevered free cash flows that TEGNA is expected
to generate during fiscal years 2022E and 2023E based upon the following sets of Forecasts: the Consensus
Estimates Case, the Base Case, the Weighted Sensitivity, the Pessimistic Case and the Optimistic Case, respectively
(each of the Base Case, the Weighted Sensitivity Case, the Pessimistic Case and the Optimistic Case, as summarized
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Management Projections”).
Greenhill also calculated a terminal value for TEGNA at the end of this period by applying a range of exit multiples of
7.0x to 8.0x to the average of the projected EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 using these same sets of Forecasts. Greenhill
selected this range of exit multiples based on Greenhill’s professional judgment and experience. Greenhill then
discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December
31, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00% for TEGNA. Then, Greenhill subtracted net debt,
redeemable noncontrolling interests and unfunded pension liability and added equity investments to derive an
implied equity value, which it then divided by the number of fully diluted shares, as provided by management of
TEGNA, to obtain a range of implied equity values per share as follows:
Range

$21.57 to $26.47
Weighted Sensitivity
$21.61 to $26.51
Base Case
$23.19 to $28.30

Present Value of Future Share Price. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill
calculated a range of the present values of future share prices using the multiple reference range of 7.0x to 8.0x based
on the ratio of enterprise value to average 2022-23E Weighted Sensitivity Case EBITDA and a 12.3% cost of equity.
Based on the foregoing, Greenhill noted that the range of such present values of future shares price was $22.09 to
$26.54 per share of TEGNA common stock.
Precedent Premiums Paid. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill calculated a
range of implied share prices by applying a range of precedent premiums paid from 25% to 35% to the unaffected
closing price of TEGNA common stock of $17.26 as of September 14, 2021. Based on the foregoing, Greenhill noted
that the range of implied prices per share was $21.58 to $23.30 per share of TEGNA common stock.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill
reviewed certain equity research analyst price targets for TEGNA common stock between TEGNA’s Q2’21 earnings
release on August 9, 2021 and September 14, 2021. Greenhill noted that the range of such price targets was $20.00 to
$24.00 per share of TEGNA common stock.
52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill
reviewed the trading range for TEGNA common stock for the trailing 52-week period as of September 14, 2021.
Greenhill noted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $11.26 and $21.52 per share of
TEGNA common stock, respectively.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by Greenhill. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Greenhill believes
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the
foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete
view of the processes underlying the analyses and its fairness opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were utilized to create points of reference for
analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of Greenhill with respect to the actual value of TEGNA.
The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Greenhill. In arriving at its opinion, Greenhill did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors
considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, Greenhill considered the totality of the
factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion. Accordingly, Greenhill believes that the summary set forth
above and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions thereof, without considering all of
its analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by
Greenhill are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, Greenhill’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the summary of the peer trading multiples analysis or the precedent transaction
multiples analysis is identical to TEGNA, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.
However, the companies for the peer trading multiples analysis were selected because they are publicly traded
companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of Greenhill’s analysis, may be considered similar to
those of TEGNA. The transactions selected for the precedent transaction multiples analysis were similarly chosen
because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of Greenhill’s analysis, may be considered similar to
the Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies
compared to TEGNA and the transactions compared to the Merger.
Greenhill is an internationally recognized investment banking firm regularly engaged in providing financial advisory
services in connection with mergers and acquisitions. TEGNA selected Greenhill as its financial advisor in connection
with the Merger on the basis of Greenhill’s experience in similar transactions, its reputation in the investment banking
community and its familiarity with the media sector.
For services rendered in connection with the Merger and the delivery of the opinion, TEGNA has agreed to pay
Greenhill a fee of $12,000,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable upon delivery of Greenhill’s fairness opinion and
the remainder of which is contingent and payable only upon the completion of the Merger. In addition, TEGNA has
agreed to reimburse Greenhill for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify Greenhill against certain liabilities arising out of Greenhill’s
engagement. During the two years preceding the date of Greenhill’s opinion, Greenhill has not been engaged by,
performed any services for or received any compensation from TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub, Standard General,
Apollo, the other Parent Restructuring Entities or their respective affiliates, other than the compensation that was
paid to Greenhill under the letter agreements pursuant to which Greenhill was retained as a financial advisor to
TEGNA in connection with the Merger. In the two years preceding the date of Greenhill’s opinion, Greenhill has been
engaged by certain affiliates of Apollo and Ares Management to provide financial advisory services; however, no
transactions have ensued, and Greenhill has not received any compensation for its engagements from either Apollo
or Ares Management or their affiliates.

Except for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary
course earnings announcements, TEGNA, like its broadcast peers, does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose
long-term forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results. This is the result of the
historically unpredictable nature of the TEGNA business, including the effect of regulatory, political and
macroeconomic factors which are inherently difficult to project. In order to help develop a framework of evaluating
the potential future value of TEGNA, TEGNA’s management prepared a certain nonpublic, unaudited prospective
financial outlook for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023 (the “Base Case”), based on,
57TABLE OF CONTENTS
in part, TEGNA’s most recent actual and projected results, including TEGNA’s financial performance throughout 2021.
The Base Case was prepared without giving effect to any incremental acquisitions or investments. The Base Case
was made available to, and approved by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. The Base Case (other than the unlevered free cash flow calculations) was also made
available to Parent and its affiliates at Parent’s request in connection with their due diligence review of a potential
transaction with TEGNA.
Given the unpredictability of the macroeconomic environment, including regulatory factors and the impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic, TEGNA’s management also prepared for the consideration of the Board of Directors two
additional nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information cases for TEGNA using a range of different
assumptions, which cases, together with the Base Case, were made available to, and approved by, the Board of
Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Base Per Share Merger Consideration. These cases
leverage the Base Case with the following variations in order to reflect a range of outcomes:
•
Optimistic Sensitivity Case: A variation of the Base Case that reflects increased revenue growth as a result
of faster-than-expected economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, industry improvements, increased
viewership and deceleration of net subscriber losses, and favorable regulatory outcomes.
•
Pessimistic Sensitivity Case: A variation of the Base Case that reflects decreased revenue as a result of
slower economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced advertising revenue, declining viewership
and acceleration of net subscriber losses, and regulatory constraints.
After reviewing and discussing the Base Case, Optimistic Sensitivity Case and Pessimistic Sensitivity Case, the
Board of Directors determined that J.P. Morgan and Greenhill should apply a 60%, 15% and 25% weighting to the
Base Case, the Optimistic Sensitivity Case and the Pessimistic Sensitivity Case, respectively (such weighted blend,
the “Weighted Sensitivity Case” and together with the Base Case, the Optimistic Sensitivity Case and the Pessimistic
Sensitivity Case, the “Cases”), in performing their respective financial analyses of the Base Per Share Merger
Consideration to be paid to TEGNA stockholders in connection with the Merger, which financial analyses were
presented to the Board of Directors by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill, respectively, and are summarized in the sections of
this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC” and “-Opinion of Greenhill & Co., LLC,”
respectively. The Weighted Sensitivity Case was also reviewed by TEGNA’s management, J.P. Morgan and Greenhill
with, and considered by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation, recommendation, and approval of
the Merger.

“Adjusted EBITDA” is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated as net income attributable to TEGNA before (1) net
(income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) income taxes, (3) interest expense, (4) equity (loss) income
in unconsolidated investments, net, (5) other non-operating items, net, (6) workforce restructuring expense, (7) M&A-related
costs, (8) certain advisory fees, (9) spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net, (10) depreciation and (11) amortization.
(2)
“Unlevered Free Cash Flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill in connection
with their respective discounted cash flow analyses, using the financial information provided by TEGNA, as Adjusted EBITDA (as
shown in the table above) further adjusted by deducting payments made for (i) taxes (estimated cash tax expense on an unlevered
basis), (ii) purchases of property and equipment, (iii) changes in net working capital, and, in the case of J.P. Morgan’s analysis,
(iv) syndicated programming payment, net of syndicated programming amortization.
(3)
J.P. Morgan’s and Greenhill’s respective valuation analysis utilizing Unlevered Free Cash Flow differed with respect to their
treatment of the Company’s syndicated programming amortization and payments as reflected in clause (iv) of footnote 2 above.
In J.P. Morgan’s analysis, actual syndicated programming payment amounts were included in the Unlevered Free Cash Flow
calculation, while in Greenhill’s analysis the amortizations related to such payments, which closely approximate the actual
payments, were utilized. This resulted in J.P. Morgan’s and Greenhill’s respective analysis utilizing the Base Case, Optimistic
Sensitivity Case, Pessimistic Sensitivity Case and Weighted Sensitivity Case being inconsistent. The amounts in the table for Base
Case, Optimistic Sensitivity Case, Pessimistic Sensitivity Case and Weighted Sensitivity Case reflect the metrics used only in
Greenhill’s valuation analysis. J.P. Morgan’s valuation analysis utilized the Base Case, Optimistic Sensitivity Case, Pessimistic
Sensitivity Case and Weighted Sensitivity Case as follows:

J.P. Morgan’s valuation analysis also utilized prospective Levered Free Cash Flow for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.
“Levered Free Cash Flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated by J.P. Morgan in connection with its
discounted cash flow analysis, using the financial information provided by TEGNA, as Unlevered Free Cash Flow (as shown in the
table above) further adjusted as follows: plus (i) taxes (estimated cash tax expense on an unlevered basis), plus (ii) non-cash stock
based compensation, minus (iii) cash net interest expense, minus (iv) taxes (estimated cash taxes on a levered basis), plus (v)
syndicated programming payments, net of amortization.
TEGNA’s management also provided unaudited revenue and unaudited Adjusted EBITDA of TEGNA for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors and to Standard General, and the unaudited unlevered free
cash flows of TEGNA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors, which information is

The Cases were developed by TEGNA management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other M&A or changes to capital allocation.
Furthermore, the Cases do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although
the Cases are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by
TEGNA management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and
financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to TEGNA’s business, all of which are difficult
or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond TEGNA’s control. The Cases constitute forward-
looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the results forecasted in the Cases, including, but not limited to, TEGNA’s performance, industry performance,
general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in
applicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various
risks set forth in TEGNA’s reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Cases will be realized or that
actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the Cases. The Cases cover two years, and such
information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Cases will be affected by
TEGNA’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Cases reflect
assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be considered a
guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the
Cases should not be regarded as an indication that TEGNA, J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, their respective officers, directors,
affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now
considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The
inclusion of the Cases in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Cases will be
necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by TEGNA or any other person regarding
the Cases or TEGNA’s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Cases should be evaluated, if at all, in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about TEGNA contained in TEGNA’s public
filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can
Find More Information.” In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Cases, TEGNA
stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Cases.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Cases were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the
published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or with GAAP, or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information.
The prospective financial information, including the Cases, included in this proxy statement has been prepared by,
and is the responsibility of, TEGNA’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed,
examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to such prospective financial information and,
accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to
TEGNA’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and
should not be read to do so.
Adjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Levered Free Cash Flow are “non-GAAP financial measures,”
which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP
financial measures were relied upon by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill for purposes of their respective opinions and by the
Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a
reconciliation of prospective non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to prospective
non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the
Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. Accordingly, TEGNA has not
provided a reconciliation of the prospective financial measures included in the Cases to the relevant GAAP financial
measures. However, reconciliations of historical, actual non-GAAP financial measures are provided above.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by J.P. Morgan and Greenhill for purposes of
their respective opinions or by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented
in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by TEGNA may not be comparable to similarly
titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures
because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly,
these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The summary of such information above is included solely to give TEGNA stockholders access to the information
that was made available to the Board of Directors, J.P. Morgan, Greenhill, and Parent and its affiliates (in the case of
Parent and its affiliates, such information excluded Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Levered Free Cash Flow), and is
not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any TEGNA stockholder to make any investment decision
with respect to the Merger or the Merger Agreement, including whether or not to approve the Merger Agreement
Proposal or to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares of TEGNA common stock. In addition, neither the
Cases nor any other financial information included in this proxy statement have been updated or revised to reflect
information or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the TEGNA stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement, TEGNA stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of TEGNA have certain
interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of TEGNA stockholders generally.
The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and in making their
recommendation that TEGNA stockholders approve the Merger Agreement.
These interests include:
•
accelerated vesting and settlement of TEGNA equity awards;
•
a prorated annual bonus in respect of the year in which the Closing or termination occurs;
•
potential severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the
Merger; and
61TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving
Corporation.
The foregoing interests are described in further detail below.
TEGNA’s executive officers (all of whom are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below) are the
following:
•
David T. Lougee, President and Chief Executive Officer;
•
Victoria D. Harker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;
•
Lynn Beall, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer - Media Operations; and
•
Akin S. Harrison, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
The Merger will be a “change in control” for purposes of the TEGNA executive compensation and benefit plans and
agreements described below.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on March 18, 2022 (the “Assumed Closing Date”),
which is the assumed date of the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;
•
The Per Share Merger Consideration is $24.00; and
•
The employment of each executive officer of TEGNA was terminated by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms
are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on
the Assumed Closing Date.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before completion of the Merger.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding TEGNA
equity awards (including those held by the executive officers) will be treated as follows, subject to all required
withholding taxes:
•
Each Company Restricted Stock Award will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to
the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration.
•
Each Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and be converted into
the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common
stock subject to such Company RSU Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration.
•
Each Company PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and be converted into
the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common
stock subject to such Company PSU Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The
number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to a Company PSU Award not granted in 2021 will be
determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement, which generally provide
that the number of shares is determined based on target performance, unless the two-year performance
period is complete as of the change in control, in which case the number of shares is determined based on
actual performance. The number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to each Company PSU Award
granted in 2021 will equal the greater of
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(x) such number as determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement (as
described in the immediately preceding sentence) and (y) the number of shares that would be paid under
such award assuming the Company’s actual performance versus target performance for 2021 was also
achieved for 2022.
•
Each Company Phantom Share Unit Award will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal
to the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock in respect of such Company Phantom
Share Unit Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of each named executive officer’s
unvested TEGNA equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate value of the unvested TEGNA equity awards held by
TEGNA’s nonemployee directors is $441,551.
Treatment of Annual Bonus
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA will provide to each TEGNA employee (including each of the
named executive officers) who is eligible to participate in a TEGNA annual bonus program, a prorated portion of the
annual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus will
be determined based on the greater of (a) the employee’s target annual bonus for such year and (b) the employee’s
annual bonus amount for such year determined based on actual performance results through the Closing.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated amount of the prorated bonus payment
that each of TEGNA’s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Executive Change in Control Severance Arrangements
TEGNA maintains the TEGNA 2015 Change in Control Severance Plan (the “CIC Severance Plan”), which provides
severance benefits for its participants upon a change in control of TEGNA. Mr. Lougee is the only executive officer
who participates in the CIC Severance Plan. Under the CIC Severance Plan, a participant would be eligible for
severance benefits if the participant’s employment is terminated by TEGNA without “cause,” or due to the
participant’s resignation for “good reason,” in either case, on or within two years following a change in control of
TEGNA, or prior to a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control, subject to
the participant’s execution and non-revocation of a release agreement.
The severance benefits under the CIC Severance Plan are (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times the sum
of (i) the participant’s highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period immediately before the change in
control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater, and (ii) the average annual bonus the
participant earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the change in
control occurs or immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs, whichever is greater; (b)
a prorated annual bonus calculated based on the average annual bonus the participant earned with respect to the
three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs; and (c) the monthly
COBRA cost of the participant’s medical and dental coverage in effect as of the date of termination multiplied by the
lesser of (i) 18 and (ii) 24 minus the number of full months between the date of the change in control and the date of
termination.
TEGNA also maintains the TEGNA Transitional Compensation Plan (the “TCP”), a legacy change-in-control plan that
provides severance protections for its participants upon a change in control of TEGNA. All of TEGNA’s executive
officers other than Mr. Lougee participate in the TCP. Under the TCP, a participant would be eligible for severance
benefits if the participant’s employment is terminated by TEGNA without “cause,” or due to the participant’s
resignation for “good reason,” in either case, on or within two years following a change in control of TEGNA, or prior
to a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control. In addition the TCP
entitles Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison to severance benefits upon a resignation without good reason during a 30-day
window period beginning on the first anniversary of the change in control.
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The severance benefits under the TCP are (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times (or in the case of Ms.
Harker, two times) the sum of (i) the participant’s highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period (plus
certain other compensation included in the participant’s income for income tax purposes during such 12-month
period) immediately before the change in control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater,
and (ii) the highest annual bonus earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in
which the change in control occurs or the highest annual bonus earned with respect to any fiscal year during the
period between the change in control and the date of termination, whichever is greater; (b) a prorated annual bonus
calculated based on the highest annual bonus the participant earned with respect to the three fiscal years
immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs; (c) continuation of life insurance coverage
and medical benefits for three years (or in the case of Ms. Harker, two years); and (d) for each of Ms. Beall and Mr.
Harrison, a lump-sum payment in an amount determined based upon the retirement plan benefits and supplemental
executive retirement plan benefits the participant would have received if participant had remained employed by the
Company during the applicable severance period.
If the compensation and benefits payable to an executive officer would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code, (a) in the case of Mr. Lougee and Ms. Harker, such amounts shall either be paid in full
or reduced to the level that would avoid application of the excise tax, whichever would place the executive officer in a
better after-tax position; and (b) each of Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison would receive a make-whole payment, which
would generally place such executive officer in the same after-tax position that he or she would have been in if the
excise tax did not apply.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated amounts that each of TEGNA’s named
executive officers would receive under the applicable change-in-control arrangement upon a qualifying termination of
employment following a change in control of TEGNA.
Retirement Plans
TEGNA maintains the TEGNA Supplemental Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a nonqualified defined benefit
pension plan maintained for the benefit of designated U.S.-based management or highly compensated employees
whose benefits under TEGNA’s tax-qualified defined benefit plan, the TEGNA Retirement Plan (“TRP”), are limited by
IRS limitations on amounts that may be paid from a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. All of TEGNA’s
executive officers participate in both the TRP and the SERP, other than Ms. Harker, who does not participate in any
defined benefit plan. Each executive officer who participates in the TRP is already fully vested in his or her TRP
benefits.
Generally, a participant must complete five years of service and attain the age of 55 to become 100% vested in his or
her benefits under the SERP. Each of the executive officers who participate in the SERP is already fully vested in his or
her SERP benefits, other than Mr. Harrison. In accordance with the rules under the SERP, Mr. Harrison’s SERP benefits
will become fully vested upon a change in control.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of the accelerated benefits that Mr.
Harrison would receive under the SERP upon a change in control of TEGNA.
Potential Employment Arrangements with Parent
Any of TEGNA’s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide
services to Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, prior to, on or following the Closing, enter into new
compensation arrangements with Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no new
individualized compensation arrangements between TEGNA’s executive officers and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation have been established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain
ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the effective time under directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is
further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Indemnification and
Insurance.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of TEGNA that is
based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits
described below, see the discussion in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of TEGNA’s
Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger. For purposes
of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
The Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on the Assumed Closing Date;
•
The Per Share Merger Consideration is $24.00; and
•
The employment of each executive officer of TEGNA was terminated by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms
are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on
the Assumed Closing Date.
For purposes of this disclosure, “single trigger” refers to payments and benefits that arise solely as a result of the
completion of the Merger and “double trigger” refers to payments and benefits that require the completion of the
Merger and a qualifying termination of employment.

Cash. Mr. Lougee is eligible for cash severance consisting of (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his
highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period immediately before the change in control or immediately before the
date of termination, whichever is greater, and (ii) the average annual bonus he earned with respect to the three fiscal years
immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the change in control occurs or immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the
date of termination occurs, whichever is greater; and (b) a prorated annual bonus calculated based on the average annual bonus he
earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs. All of
such payments are “double-trigger.”
Each of the other named executive officers is eligible for cash severance benefits consisting of (a) a cash severance equal to three
times (or in the case of Ms. Harker, two times) the sum of the executive officer’s (i) highest rate of annual salary during the 12-
month period (plus certain other compensation included in the executive officer’s income for income tax purposes during such
12-month period) immediately before the change in control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater,
and (ii) highest annual bonus earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the change
in control occurs or the highest annual bonus earned with respect to any fiscal year during the period between the change in
control and the date of termination, whichever is greater; and (b) a prorated annual bonus calculated based on the highest annual
bonus the participant earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of
termination occurs. In addition, for Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison, the cash column includes a lump-sum payment in an amount
determined based upon the TRP and SERP benefits the executive officer would have received if the executive officer had
remained employed by the Company during the applicable severance period under the TCP. All of such payments are “double-
trigger.”
In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA will provide to each TEGNA employee (including each of the
named executive officers) who is eligible to participate in a TEGNA annual bonus program a prorated portion of the annual bonus
with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus will be determined based on
the greater of (a) the employee’s target annual bonus for such year and (b) the employee’s annual bonus amount for such year
determined based on actual performance results through the Closing. Such prorated bonus is a “single-trigger” benefit.
For purposes of this table, the amount of the prorated bonus is based on the greater of that payable under the Merger Agreement
and that payable under the terms of the applicable severance plan.
For further details regarding potential payments in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the
Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Executive Change in Control Severance Arrangement.” The
estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

Financing of the Merger",72,77
TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to
pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at Closing by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement,
will be approximately $9.3 billion. This amount includes funds needed to pay the Required Amounts. Parent and
Midco have obtained committed financing consisting of (i) the Preferred Securities Financing to be provided to
Parent by the Apollo Funds and the Ares Funds (and any such other investor who becomes a party to the Preferred
Securities Commitment Letter pursuant to an assignment from an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund) pursuant to the
terms of the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter and (ii) the Debt Financing to be provided to Midco (a wholly
owned direct subsidiary of Parent) pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter by the lenders party thereto. In
connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to TEGNA copies of the Financing
Letters.
66TABLE OF CONTENTS
Preferred Securities Financing
Pursuant to the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter, the Apollo Funds and the Ares Funds (and any such other
investor who becomes a party thereto pursuant to an assignment from an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund) have
committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to Parent at Closing an aggregate amount in cash equal to $925
million or such lesser amount that in the aggregate (together with the Debt Financing) suffices to fully fund the
Required Amounts. The obligations of each Apollo Fund and Ares Fund (and any such other investor who becomes
a party to the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter pursuant to an assignment from an Apollo Fund or an Ares
Fund) to provide the preferred securities financing under the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter are subject to a
number of conditions, including: (i) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of the Merger Agreement (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), (ii) the full amount of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or, if applicable,
alternative debt financing having been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Preferred Securities Financing is
funded at the Closing and (iii) the substantially concurrent consummation of the Closing.
The obligation of the Apollo Funds and the Ares Funds (or any such other investor who becomes a party thereto
pursuant to an assignment from an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund) to fund the preferred securities commitment will
automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (ii) the consummation of the Closing and the payment by Parent of all amounts due by it
under the Merger Agreement and (iii) the date that the Company or any of its controlled affiliates or any of their
respective representatives acting at their direction bring a claim that is prohibited by the Preferred Securities
Commitment Letter.
TEGNA is an express third-party beneficiary of the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter for the purpose of
specifically enforcing: (i) Parent’s right to cause the commitment under the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter by
an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund (or any such other investor who becomes a party thereto pursuant to an assignment
from an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund) to be funded to Parent in accordance with the Preferred Securities
Commitment Letter, (ii) the obligations of Parent and the Apollo Funds and the Ares Funds (or any such other
investor who becomes a party thereto pursuant to an assignment from an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund), including to
cause Parent to enforce its rights against such Apollo Fund or such Ares Fund (or any such other investor who
becomes a party thereto pursuant to an assignment from an Apollo Fund or an Ares Fund) to perform its funding
obligations under the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter and (iii) its rights to consent to certain matters as
expressly provided for in the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter, in each case subject to (x) the limitations and
conditions set forth in the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter and (y) the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing
In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Midco entered into the Debt Commitment Letter, pursuant to
which the debt financing sources party thereto have committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, Midco with the Debt Financing.
The Debt Commitment Letter provides that the financing sources party thereto will provide, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, in the aggregate up to $8.211 billion in debt financing (not all of which is
expected to be drawn at Closing), consisting of the following:
•
$3.50 billion senior secured term loan facility;
•
$500 million senior secured revolving credit facility;
•
$1.496 billion senior secured bridge facility; and
•
$2.715 billion senior unsecured bridge facility.
We refer to the debt financing described above as the “Debt Financing.” The proceeds of the Debt Financing will be
used (i) to effect the Merger and related transactions on the Closing Date, (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the
Merger and related transactions and (iii) in the case of the senior secured revolving credit

TABLE OF CONTENTS
facility, for general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount of the Debt Financing will be reduced on a dollar for
dollar basis by the aggregate amount of the Existing Company Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that
remain outstanding on the Closing Date after giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and related
transactions.
The obligations of the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letter are subject to a number of customary conditions, including, but not limited to (as applicable):
•
the substantially simultaneous or substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger on the terms
described in the Merger Agreement as in effect on February 22, 2022 (without giving effect to any
amendment, waiver, consent or modification of any of the provisions thereof by Midco that is materially
adverse to the interests of the lenders (in their capacities as such) without the consent of the lead arrangers
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned));
•
since September 30, 2021, there not having been any Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement as in
effect on February 22, 2022) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement as in effect on
February 22, 2022) that is continuing;
•
subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the accuracy in all material respects as of the Closing of
certain specified representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and certain specified
representations and warranties in the loan documents;
•
the Preferred Securities Financing shall have been consummated (or substantially simultaneously or
substantially concurrently with the closing of the Debt Financing shall be consummated); and
•
such lenders having been afforded a marketing period of at least 15 consecutive days (subject to certain
blackout dates) following receipt of a customary offering document for offerings of debt securities under
Rule 144A (as described in the Debt Commitment Letter and which shall include certain required financial
information regarding TEGNA).
As of the date hereof, the definitive documentation governing the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the Debt Financing may differ from
those described in this proxy statement.
Guarantee
Pursuant to the Guarantee, the SG Holders and CMG have agreed to guarantee the due and punctual payment and
performance of: (i) the aggregate amount of the Parent Financing Termination Fee (as defined in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees”) solely if and when any of the Parent
Financing Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (ii) the aggregate amount of the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-
Termination Fees”) solely if and when any of the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the
Merger Agreement; provided that only the SG Holders have guaranteed payment of the Parent Non-Breach
Regulatory Termination Fee (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-
Termination Fees”); (iii) any enforcement expenses due by Parent pursuant to legal proceedings as a result of certain
defaults under the Merger Agreement; provided that payment of enforcement expenses relating to the Parent Non-
Breach Regulatory Termination Fee shall be guaranteed only by the SG Holders; and (iv) the reimbursement
obligations of Parent pursuant to the indemnification obligations to TEGNA and its representatives in connection
with Debt Financing. We refer to the obligations set forth in the preceding sentence as the “Guaranteed Obligations.”
The obligations of the SG Holders and CMG under the Guarantee are subject to an aggregate cap equal to $272
million. Under certain circumstances set forth therein, the Apollo Funds have agreed to backstop the guarantee
provided by CMG under the Guarantee.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest of:
•
the consummation of the Closing and the payment by Parent of all amounts due by it under the Merger
Agreement;
•
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations by or on behalf of the SG Holders and CMG, and the Apollo Funds,
as applicable, as the guarantor entities under the Guarantee;

Agreement is terminated in any of the circumstances pursuant to which Parent would be required to make
any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, unless TEGNA (A) shall have delivered a claim in writing with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations prior to the 90th day after the valid termination of the Merger
Agreements and (B) shall have commenced an action during such 120 days period alleging that Parent is

Appraisal Rights",80,80
TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of TEGNA common stock through the
Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section
262”). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL
and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in
Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of TEGNA common stock
unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of TEGNA common stock is entitled to
demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of
TEGNA common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker, trust or other nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to
perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of TEGNA common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee
and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, TEGNA stockholders who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of
their shares; (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) continuously are the record
holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures
69TABLE OF CONTENTS
set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted appraisal
rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1%
of the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or
(b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of TEGNA common stock for
which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the
“ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the
date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the
appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of
such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value”
of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of
such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make
such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal
rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes TEGNA’s notice
to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the Merger, any TEGNA stockholder who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully.
Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of
appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the
procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of TEGNA common stock, TEGNA believes that if a
stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of TEGNA common stock must do ALL
of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
the stockholder must deliver to TEGNA a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the
Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the
Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock held either
in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition
in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120
days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has
no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Filing Written Demand
Any TEGNA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to TEGNA, before the vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will
be submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder
must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A TEGNA stockholder exercising
appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must
continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain
voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will
constitute a waiver of the TEGNA stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written
demand for appraisal. Therefore, a TEGNA stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain
from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption
of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.
The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A
TEGNA stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of TEGNA stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of TEGNA common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of TEGNA common stock must be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform TEGNA of the identity of the holder and
state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If the
shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such
demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than
one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint
owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for
appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly
disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
TEGNA STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR
BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES
FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.
A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER
PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD
HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT
APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Tysons, Virginia 22102
Any TEGNA stockholder who has delivered a written demand to TEGNA and who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept
the Per Share Merger Consideration by delivering to TEGNA a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require
written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be
dismissed as to any TEGNA stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this
shall not affect the right of any TEGNA stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share
Merger Consideration within 60 days after the
71
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and TEGNA, as the Surviving Corporation, does not
approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any
TEGNA stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding
with respect to a TEGNA stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined
in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger
Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each TEGNA
stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any TEGNA stockholder
who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any
beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a TEGNA
stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting
TEGNA stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present
intention, to file a petition, and TEGNA stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a
petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of TEGNA common stock.
Accordingly, any TEGNA stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action
to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of TEGNA common stock within the time and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a TEGNA stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in
Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any TEGNA stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section
262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and with respect to which TEGNA has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting TEGNA
stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or
within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial
owner of shares of TEGNA common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may,
in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing
statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a TEGNA stockholder and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the
Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all TEGNA stockholders
who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not
been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time
and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the TEGNA
stockholders shown on the written statement described above at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also
be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne
by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to TEGNA stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those TEGNA stockholders who have
complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require TEGNA stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates
(if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any
TEGNA stockholder fails to comply with the
72
TABLE OF CONTENTS
direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all TEGNA stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if
neither of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of “Fair Value”
After determining the TEGNA stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will
be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair
value” of the shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in
its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of
payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date
of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the
appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each TEGNA stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at
such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual
circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s exclusive remedy.
TEGNA stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they
would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is
not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as
to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same
as, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither TEGNA nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share
Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of TEGNA and Parent reserves the
rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of TEGNA common stock is less than the Per
Share Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will
cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of
experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a TEGNA stockholder, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with
an
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination
or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any TEGNA stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of TEGNA common stock under Section
262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of
TEGNA common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration. A TEGNA stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such holder’s
right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the
ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the
stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no TEGNA stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote
such shares of TEGNA common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of TEGNA common stock, if any, payable to
TEGNA stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the
ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to the TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or
if the TEGNA stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval
of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for
appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to
any TEGNA stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms
as the court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any TEGNA stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the
Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any TEGNA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged
to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,Litigation Relating to the Merger,"Litigation Relating to the Merger
As of April 12, 2022, six lawsuits have been filed by purported TEGNA stockholders in connection with the Merger.
On March 28, 2022, a purported TEGNA stockholder filed a lawsuit against TEGNA and the current members of the
Board of Directors alleging that the preliminary proxy statement filed by TEGNA on March 25, 2022 in connection
with the Merger contained alleged material misstatements and/or omissions in violation of federal law. The lawsuit is
captioned Wang v. TEGNA Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02513, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. On March 29, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants asserting similar
claims. The lawsuit is captioned O’Dell v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02547, and is also pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 30, 2022, two additional lawsuits were filed against the
same defendants asserting similar claims; the first lawsuit is captioned Waterman v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-
01789, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York; the second lawsuit is captioned
Landskroner v. TEGNA, Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02611, and was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York until it was voluntarily dismissed on April 1, 2022. In addition, on March 31, 2022, a fifth lawsuit
was filed against the same defendants bringing similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Whitfield v. TEGNA Inc. et al.,
No. 2:22-cv-01247, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Finally, on April
7, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants, also asserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned
Nutkis v. TEGNA Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02894, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York.
The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by TEGNA on March 25, 2022 in
connection with the Merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial
projections of TEGNA, (ii) certain financial analyses of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill, (iii) the financial
74TABLE OF CONTENTS
benefits to TEGNA executives and members of the Board of Directors from the Merger and (iv) certain statements
concerning the sales process. Plaintiffs generally seek, among other things, to enjoin TEGNA from consummating the
Merger, or in the alternative, rescission of the Merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney’s fees.
TEGNA believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the
Merger may also be filed in the future.

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that
may be relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of shares of TEGNA common stock whose shares of TEGNA
common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S.
Holders who hold their shares of TEGNA common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of
the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and
all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such
change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position
contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought
from the IRS regarding any matter discussed below.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the
U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and
circumstances, or to TEGNA stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including,
for example, but not limited to:
•
holders other than U.S. Holders (as defined below);
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of
TEGNA common stock (by vote or value);
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations
and pension funds;
•
holders that hold shares of TEGNA common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other
integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
•
U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
Partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S
corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such
entities);
•
expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;
•
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of TEGNA common
stock (by vote or value);

•
grantor trusts;
•
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate
earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
holders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
•
holders that hold their TEGNA common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a
branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to TEGNA common
stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement; and
•
holders exercising appraisal rights.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax
(such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax
considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or any
considerations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010
(including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in
connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and
certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of TEGNA
common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY
PARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX
CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless
of its source; or
•
a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of such trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United
States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of TEGNA common stock pursuant to the Merger will be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss
in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares of TEGNA common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of TEGNA common stock. A U.S. Holder’s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of TEGNA common stock
generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger.
Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal
income tax at preferential rates currently, which rates are subject to change. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of TEGNA common stock at different times or
different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to
each block of TEGNA common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in
connection with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder
pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed
and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that
such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise
complies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL
CHANGES OR INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE
ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL
INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH,
OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-
INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS
ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
TEGNA and Parent and, in certain circumstances, the other Parent Restructuring Entities have agreed to take all
action necessary to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and, subject to certain limitations, to obtain
all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement. These approvals include clearances
under the HSR Act and the Communications Act and FCC rules.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting periods applicable to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement have expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable
under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day waiting period following the parties’ filings
of their HSR Act notification and report forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the Federal Trade
Commission (the “FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issues a request for
additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as the “Second Request”) prior to the expiration
of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only
after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier
or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.
The parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 8, 2022. On April 11, 2022, the parties re-
filed their HSR filings to give the DOJ additional time to review the Merger.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR Act,
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Contribution Agreement, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or
hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the
completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, any state could take
such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could
include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal
action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will
prevail.
Federal Communications Commission Consent
TEGNA holds various licenses necessary for the operation of its broadcast television stations. These licenses are
granted by the FCC. The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules require that, in connection with a change of
control of TEGNA, TEGNA and the transferee must make certain filings with the FCC. Under the Merger Agreement,
it is a condition to each party’s obligation to complete the Merger that the FCC grant the FCC Consent, which
includes the grant of applications to transfer control of TEGNA’s licenses and a petition for declaratory ruling under
Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules governing foreign ownership. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Efforts to Consummate
the Merger.”
The FCC Applications involve a change of more than 50% of the voting rights representing ultimate control of
TEGNA and its broadcast subsidiaries and thus will constitute a “substantial” change in ownership or control of the
TEGNA licensees within the meaning of the FCC’s rules. Accordingly, the FCC must provide public notice for a
period of 30 days prior to acting on the FCC Applications. During that period, interested parties, including members
of the public, may file informal objections to, or petitions to deny, the FCC Applications. The filing of a petition to
deny or an informal objection could delay FCC processing of the FCC Applications.
In determining whether to approve the transfer of control of a television broadcast licensee or an assignment of
license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the proposed licensee, including compliance with
various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons
holding significant voting or positional interests in the licensee or in the entities controlling the licensee, the
Communications Act limitations on foreign ownership and control of broadcast licensees, and compliance with FCC
rules and regulations. The timing or outcome of the FCC approval process cannot be predicted.
The parties have submitted the FCC Applications required to obtain the FCC Consent.
Restructuring and Contribution Agreement",88,89
TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,Restructuring and Contribution Agreement,"Restructuring and Contribution Agreement
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Contribution Agreement, the Parent Restructuring Entities have
agreed to a series of sequential transactions pursuant to which, among other things, CMG will transfer its WFXT,
Boston, Massachusetts, station to Parent, and acquire the station group currently indirectly owned by CNM. The
CNM stations to be acquired by CMG are (i) KBSI (Fox), Cape Girardeau, Missouri; (ii) KLKN (ABC), Lincoln,
Nebraska; (iii) WDKA (MyNet), Paducah, Kentucky; and (iv) WLNE-TV(ABC), New Bedford, Massachusetts. In
connection with the transactions and prior to the Merger, Parent will be recapitalized as a subsidiary of affiliates of
Standard General, which will hold the voting common equity securities of Parent, and the equity securities of Parent
held by CMG will be recapitalized into non-convertible and non-voting preferred securities of Parent.
Following the completion of the Merger, CMG is expected to acquire TEGNA’s (i) Austin, Texas station, KVUE-TV,
and (ii) Dallas, Texas station, KMPX, and Houston, Texas stations, KHOU and KTBU, in each case, subject to
definitive agreements providing the terms and conditions of the Post-Closing Transfers.
78TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Contribution Agreement and the other agreements setting forth the Post-Closing Transfers are subject to
customary termination rights, and the obligations of the parties to complete such transactions are subject to
customary closing conditions, including, among others, the satisfaction or waiver approval of the closing conditions
specified in the Merger Agreement, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and
approval from the FCC. There can be no guarantee that the closing conditions, including those described above, will
be satisfied, and the Merger, the Restructuring and related transactions may or may not be consummated on the
terms described herein, or at all.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express
terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy
statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement
(i) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub and the other Parent Restructuring Entities in
connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties
have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between TEGNA,
Parent, Merger Sub and the other Parent Restructuring Entities rather than to establish matters as facts, and may
be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.

expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to
by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is
described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Closing Date: (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into TEGNA, with TEGNA
becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; (ii) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
thereupon cease; and (iii) TEGNA will continue as the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of TEGNA and Merger
Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of TEGNA and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.
At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Except as
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation will be the officers of TEGNA as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of TEGNA as the
Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until
thereafter amended.

Closing and Effective Time
The Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m. local time on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to Closing (described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Conditions to the Closing
of the Merger”) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or such other date, place and time agreed to in writing by Parent and
TEGNA. However, if a specified marketing period (being the first 18 consecutive days following the date on which
Parent has been provided with specified required information regarding TEGNA required by the Debt Commitment
Letter) has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Closing will then occur on the date that is the
earlier of (i) any business day during such marketing period specified by Parent to TEGNA on no less than three
business days’ prior written notice to TEGNA and (ii) the third business day after the final day of such marketing
period, or such other date, place and time agreed to in writing by Parent and TEGNA.
On the Closing Date, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware as
provided under the DGCL. The time at which the Merger will become effective is herein referred to as the “Effective

TEGNA Common Stock
At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any stockholder, each share of TEGNA common stock
other than the Excluded Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and
extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any
applicable withholding taxes.
The Per Share Merger Consideration is composed of (i) $24.00 per share of TEGNA common stock in cash, without
interest, plus (ii) (A) if the Closing Date occurs after November 22, 2022, and before February 22, 2023, an amount in
cash equal to (x) $0.00166667 multiplied by (y) the number of calendar days elapsed after November 22, 2022, to and
including the Closing Date; (B) if the Closing Date occurs on or after February 22, 2023, and before March 22, 2023,
an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.15333333 plus (y) (I) $0.0025 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed
after February 22, 2023, to and including the Closing Date; (C) if the Closing Date occurs on or after March 22, 2023
and before April 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.22333333 plus (y) (I) $0.00333333 multiplied by (II) the
number of calendar days elapsed after March 22, 2023 to and including the Closing Date; or (D) if the Closing Date
occurs on or after April 22, 2023, and before May 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.3266667 plus (y) (I)
$0.00416667 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed after April 22, 2023, to and including the Closing
Date, in each case without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Treatment of TEGNA Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that each Company Restricted Stock Award outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of TEGNA common stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award, in each case,
whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully vested and be
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TEGNA common
stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, less amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law. The number of shares
of TEGNA common stock subject to a Company PSU Award not granted in 2021 will be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable award agreement, which generally provide that the number of shares is
determined based on target performance, unless the two-year performance period is complete as of the change in
control, in which case the number of shares is determined based on actual performance. The number of shares of
TEGNA common stock subject to each Company PSU Award granted in
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
2021 will equal the greater of (x) such number as determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
award agreement (as described in the immediately preceding sentence) and (y) the number of shares that would be
paid under such award assuming the Company’s actual performance versus target performance for 2021 was also
achieved for 2022.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each Company Phantom Share Unit Award will be converted into the right
to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to such
Company Phantom Share Unit Award multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less amounts that are
required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law.

Prior to the Closing, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to TEGNA (the “Paying
Agent”) to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration to stockholders. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash sufficient (when taken together with any
cash of TEGNA and its subsidiaries on the Closing Date to the extent requested by Parent to be deposited with the
Paying Agent) to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to stockholders.
As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days), the Paying
Agent will mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder’s shares of TEGNA common stock
represented by such holder’s certificate(s) or book-entry shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares. The amount of any Per Share Merger Consideration paid to stockholders may be
reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the Payment Agent is not claimed within twelve months following the Effective Time, such
cash will be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of TEGNA common stock who have not complied with
the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to certain laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any cash
deposited with the Payment Agent that remains unclaimed as of immediately prior to the date on which such cash
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.",93,93

TEGNA has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries not to, and to not authorize or permit and use reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its and their respective officers, directors and other representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any proposal or offer or any inquiries regarding the
making of any proposal or offer, including any proposal or offer to its stockholders, that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal;
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person any information, or provide or afford access to TEGNA or its subsidiaries or their respective
properties, books and records, assets, facilities or personnel, in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than, in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the
inquiring person to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and to limit its conversation
or other communication exclusively to such referral);
•
enter into, or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
(including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement),
commitment or agreement in principle with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, as defined below); or
•
authorize, commit or resolve to do any of the foregoing;
provided, that TEGNA and its representatives are permitted, upon a good-faith determination by the Board of
Directors (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that not doing so would be inconsistent with the Board
of Directors’ fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable law, to grant a confidential waiver of any provision
of any confidentiality or standstill agreement solely to permit a Company Takeover Proposal to be made and, subject
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, negotiated and entered into.
In addition, TEGNA has agreed to, and agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries and direct its representatives to,
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, terminate access for any person to any data room and request the return or
destruction of any non-public information provided to any person in connection with a potential Company Takeover
Proposal. TEGNA has also agreed to not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or
grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality provision with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or
similar matter in any agreement to which TEGNA is a party; provided that, if the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to
88TABLE OF CONTENTS
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law, TEGNA may take such actions solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a
Company Takeover Proposal and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, thereafter negotiate and enter into
any transaction in connection therewith.
Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, if from the date of the Merger Agreement until the adoption of
the Merger Agreement by TEGNA stockholders, TEGNA receives a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal
from any person, and if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal, then TEGNA may enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such person making such Company Takeover Proposal and TEGNA and its representatives may (i)
furnish, pursuant to an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement between TEGNA and such person,
information with respect to TEGNA and its subsidiaries and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA’s stockholders, TEGNA is not entitled to terminate the
Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Company Superior Proposal unless
(1) it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent
and its representatives in good faith over a four-business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement, so that such Company Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a “Company Superior
Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such
negotiations, and (2) TEGNA has complied in all material respects with the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the
Merger Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal.
If TEGNA terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA stockholders
for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Company Superior Proposal, TEGNA must pay a $163
million termination fee to Parent.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality and non-use
provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to TEGNA than those contained in the confidentiality
agreements between TEGNA and each of Standard General and Apollo Management IX, L.P. and which shall not
contain any exclusivity provisions or other terms that would restrict in any manner TEGNA’s ability to consummate
the Merger or comply with its disclosure obligations to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
provided that any such confidentiality agreement need not contain any standstill or similar provision.
“Company Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal, substituting “50%” for “20%”
in the definition thereof, that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with TEGNA’s
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account such factors as the Board of Directors
considers in good faith to be appropriate (e.g., the timing, likelihood of consummation, legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the Company Takeover Proposal, including the terms and conditions (including financing terms)
thereof, and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers to be relevant in good faith (including proposed
revisions to the Merger Agreement made by Parent prior to the time of such determination)), to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of TEGNA common stock than the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
“Company Takeover Proposal” means any bona fide proposal or offer made by any person or group (as such term is
used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of related persons (including holders of TEGNA common stock, but
excluding Parent, the other Parent Restructuring Entities, the Investors and their Affiliates), and whether involving a
transaction or series of related transactions, for, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a direct or indirect
acquisition, including by merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, dissolution,
liquidation, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, tender offer, joint venture or similar transaction involving TEGNA or
any of its subsidiaries (a) of assets or businesses representing more than 20% of the revenues, net income or assets
of TEGNA and its subsidiaries, in each case on a consolidated basis

subsidiary) or (b) of more than 20% of the beneficial ownership or voting power of the shares of TEGNA common
stock (or options, warrants to purchase or securities convertible into or exchangeable therefor) then issued and
outstanding.

TEGNA INC_20220413_DEFM14A_20013265_4441404.Pdf,The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Recommendation Change,"The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Recommendation Change
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the
recommendation that the TEGNA stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal. The Merger Agreement
provides that the Board of Directors will not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, as defined below
and except as described below.
The Board of Directors may not take any action described in the following:
•
(i) change, qualify, modify, withhold, rescind or withdraw, or authorize or resolve to, or publicly propose or
announce its intention to, change, qualify, modify, withhold, rescind or withdraw, in each case in any
manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger Agreement
(such recommendation, the “Company Recommendation”), (ii) adopt, approve or recommend to the TEGNA
stockholders, make any public statement approving, endorsing or recommending, or resolve to approve or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company or make any public statement approving, endorsing or
recommending, a Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in this
proxy statement (any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) a “Company Adverse Recommendation
Change”);
•
authorize, cause or permit TEGNA or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture
agreement or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with a counterparty making a
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with the Merger Agreement) (a “Company Acquisition Agreement”); or
•
submit any Company Takeover Proposal to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.
However, nothing in the non-solicitation covenant of the Merger Agreement will prohibit TEGNA or the Board of
Directors from: (i) taking and disclosing to TEGNA stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) from making a “stop, look and
listen” communication to TEGNA stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii)
making any disclosure to TEGNA stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with TEGNA’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable law. Such foregoing actions may constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if they otherwise satisfy the definition of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the TEGNA
stockholders, the Board of Directors may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an
Intervening Event (as defined below), if, prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Board of Directors may only effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening
Event if:
•
TEGNA has given Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the Intervening Event;
•
during such four-business-day period, has negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (if
Parent and its representatives desire to so negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement; and
•
upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors has considered any revisions to the terms of the
Merger Agreement proposed in writing by, and that are legally binding on, Parent, Merger Sub and the
other
90TABLE OF CONTENTS
Parent Restructuring Entities, and has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
In addition, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the TEGNA stockholders, the Board of Directors may
only effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize TEGNA to terminate the Merger Agreement to
enter into an agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal in response to a bona fide written Company
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) is a Company Superior Proposal, only if:
•
in the case of the termination of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal;
•
TEGNA has given Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such
Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company
Superior Proposal and a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements related to such
Company Superior Proposal;
•
at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors has considered any revisions to the terms of the
Merger Agreement proposed in writing by, and that are legally binding on, Parent, Merger Sub and the
other Parent Restructuring Entities, and has determined, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect;
•
in the event of any change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal, TEGNA has, in each case, delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in the second bullet above and a new two business-day notice period consistent with the second
bullet above commences during which time TEGNA is required to comply with the requirements above with
respect to such additional notice; and
•
in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit TEGNA to enter into an
acquisition agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal, TEGNA will have validly
terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and paid to
Parent a termination fee of $163 million.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any event, change,
occurrence or development with respect to TEGNA or its subsidiaries, that (i) was not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) first
becomes known to the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) after the execution of the Merger Agreement
and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the TEGNA stockholders; provided, however, that any event,
change, occurrence or development (a) that involves or relates to a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company
Superior Proposal (which, for purposes of this definition, shall be read without reference to any percentages set forth
in the definitions of “Company Takeover Proposal” or “Company Superior Proposal”) or (b) solely resulting from any
change, in and of itself, after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading
volume of TEGNA common stock (excluding any underlying causes thereof), shall not be deemed to constitute an
Intervening Event.

employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (each, a “Continuing Employee”) will be provided:
•
a total target compensation opportunity (composed of base compensation and short- and long-term
incentive target opportunity) that, in the aggregate, is no less favorable than that provided immediately
before the Closing (provided that such employee’s base compensation shall not be reduced from that in
effect immediately before the Closing);

been provided under TEGNA’s severance arrangements or practices in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the severance benefits provided under the applicable Parent severance plan.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, TEGNA shall pay to each Continuing Employee a prorated portion of the
annual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus will
be determined based on the greater of (i) the Continuing Employee’s target annual bonus for such year and (ii) the
Continuing Employee’s annual bonus amount for such year determined based on actual performance results through
the last completed month prior to the Closing (or, if the Closing occurs in 2023, a full bonus in respect of 2022
calculated in accordance with the foregoing sentence as if the Closing had occurred immediately prior to the
conclusion of such fiscal year).
Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) recognize each Continuing Employee’s service with TEGNA
and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors prior to the Closing Date for all purposes under any applicable
Parent employee benefit plan, (ii) cause any preexisting condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
applicable Parent employee benefit plan providing health and welfare benefits to be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and (iii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year
in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate in such Parent employee benefit plan towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements for any co-payments or deductibles incurred
by the Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii), subject to
customary exclusions.
In addition, for one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall continue to provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue to provide, retiree medical benefits on terms no less favorable than those provided by
TEGNA immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Available Cash) on the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms thereof and
on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent applicable, the “flex” provisions) described in the Financing

promptly as reasonably practicable, alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the
available portion of the Financing, to pay the Required Amount) from the same or other sources on terms and
conditions (including market “flex” provisions) that are not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than
the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of February 22, 2022 (after giving effect to any

Financing Letters) by Parent, Merger Sub, the Other Parent Restructuring Entities, the Apollo Funds, the Ares Funds,
the SG Holders or any of their respective affiliates be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub
under the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, in no
event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require either Parent or
Merger Sub to (i) seek the preferred securities financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any material fees,
original issue discount or interest coupons, as applicable, or agree to any prepayment premiums, in each case, in

arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or the Debt Financing Parties (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of TEGNA with
respect to the solvency of TEGNA and its subsidiaries (but not Parent and its subsidiaries (other than TEGNA and its
subsidiaries)) on a consolidated basis in the form set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment Letter) and otherwise
reasonably facilitate the granting of security interests (and perfection thereof) in collateral in respect of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that the effectiveness of such documents shall be conditioned upon, or become
operative only after, the occurrence of the Effective Time; (vi) cause TEGNA’s independent auditors to (A) furnish

necessary so that such Required Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of “Required Information” (as defined in the Merger Agreement as in effect on February 22, 2022) and (iii)
would not, after giving effect to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period (as defined in the Merger Agreement as
in effect on February 22, 2022) to cease pursuant to the definition of “Marketing Period” in the Merger Agreement as
in effect on February 22, 2022, in each case prior to the completion of the Marketing Period. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of TEGNA and its
subsidiaries under the requirements of this section at any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions,
between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Closing Date; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the markets (it being understood and agreed
that once the “Marketing Period” has commenced and then been completed in accordance with the definition thereof
in the Merger Agreement as of February 22, 2022, there shall not be a subsequent “Marketing Period” hereunder).
TEGNA agrees to use reasonable best efforts to file all reports on (i) Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, (ii) to the extent
required to include financial information pursuant to Item 9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and (iii) to the extent that the failure
to file any Form 8-K would result in the Required Information containing material non-public information with regard
to TEGNA and its subsidiaries, such other Form 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the time periods required by the Exchange Act. In
addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably
requests TEGNA to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public
information with respect to TEGNA and its Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines (and TEGNA does not
reasonably object) to include in a customary offering document or marketing materials for the Debt Financing, then,
upon TEGNA’s review of and reasonable satisfaction with such filing, TEGNA shall file such Current Report on Form
8-K.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this section captioned “-Debt Financing” or
the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness” that immediately follows
this section, neither TEGNA nor any of its affiliates shall be required to: (i) take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this section or the “Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness” section that immediately follows this
section that (A) would require TEGNA, its affiliates or any persons who are directors or officers of TEGNA or its
affiliates or any of their respective representatives to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Debt Financing, any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (as defined below) or any
Redemption (as defined below) or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument, opinion, negative
assurance letter or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document,
instrument, opinion, negative assurance letter or agreement, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, that is, in each case, effective prior to the Effective Time, (B) would cause any representation or warranty
in the Merger Agreement to be breached by TEGNA or any of its affiliates, (C) would require TEGNA or any of its
affiliates to (1) pay any commitment or other similar fee or (2) incur any other expense, liability or obligation in
connection with the Debt Financing, any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations or any Redemption prior to
the Effective Time, in each case of this clause (2) that would not be reimbursed or indemnified in full by Parent in
accordance with the last sentence of the following paragraph, (D) would cause any director, officer, employee, or
stockholder of TEGNA or any of its subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, or (E) would result in a violation or
breach of, conflict with, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under any Material Contract to
which TEGNA or any of its subsidiaries is a party, the organizational documents of TEGNA or its subsidiaries or any
applicable law; (ii) provide any access, or make available any document, correspondence or information, if doing so
would, in the reasonable judgment of TEGNA’s legal counsel, jeopardize or cause a risk of loss or waiver of the
attorney-client, attorney work product or other similar privilege of TEGNA or any of its subsidiaries; provided, that in
such instance TEGNA shall inform Parent of the general nature of the information being withheld and, on Parent’s
request, reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that
would not result in any of the outcome described in this clause (ii); (iii) without otherwise limiting the obligations of
TEGNA pursuant to this section to assist Parent in Parent’s preparation of any materials that include any Excluded
Information (as defined in the Merger Agreement as in effect on February 22, 2022), prepare any Excluded
Information; or (iv) take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this section or the section of this proxy

unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of TEGNA and its

immediately follows this section or otherwise shall require TEGNA or any of its affiliates, prior to the Closing, to be an
issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing or to commence any Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations.
Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, promptly upon request by TEGNA, reimburse TEGNA or
any of its affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by them or their respective representatives in connection with such
cooperation pursuant to the obligations described in this section and the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness” that immediately follows this section and certain other cooperation as
specified in the Merger Agreement (whether or not the Merger is consummated or the Merger Agreement is
terminated) and shall (on a joint and several basis) indemnify and hold harmless TEGNA and its affiliates and their
respective representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable out-of-pocket
costs, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of
any thereof) suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, the Company
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations or any Redemption, any action taken by them at the request of Parent or its
representatives pursuant to the obligations described in this section and the “-Cooperation as to Certain
Indebtedness” section that immediately follows this section, and certain other obligations as specified in the Merger
Agreement and any information used in connection therewith (other than information provided by TEGNA, its
subsidiaries or their respective representatives), in each case, except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of
the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective representatives, as determined in a final and non-appealable judgement by a court
of competent jurisdiction.

amount of the Existing Company Notes identified by Parent to TEGNA prior to, on or after the date hereof on terms
that are acceptable to Parent (the “Offers to Purchase”) and/or (b) solicit the consent of the holders of debt issued
under the indentures governing the Existing Company Notes regarding certain proposed amendments to the
applicable indenture (the “Consent Solicitations” and, together with the Offers to Purchase, if any, the “Company
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations”); provided that the closing of any such Offers to Purchase shall not occur,
and the amendments in connection with any such Consent Solicitations shall not become operative (although any
supplemental indentures entered into in connection with any such Consent Solicitations may become effective upon
execution), prior to the Closing; provided, further, that the consummation of any Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations shall not be a condition to the Closing. Any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be
made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and conditionality) as are proposed by Parent and
which are permitted by the terms of the applicable indentures governing each series of Existing Company Notes and
applicable laws, including applicable SEC rules and regulations. Parent will reasonably consult with TEGNA regarding
the material terms and conditions of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, including the timing and
commencement of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations and any relevant tender or consent deadlines.
Parent shall not be permitted to commence any applicable Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations until
Parent shall have provided TEGNA with the related offer to purchase, consent solicitation statement, letter of
transmittal, if any, or press release, if any, in connection therewith, and each other material document relevant to the
transaction that will be distributed by the Parent in the applicable Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations
(collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a reasonable period of time in advance of Parent commencing the
applicable Offer to Purchase or Consent Solicitation to allow TEGNA and its counsel to review and comment on such
Debt Offer Documents, and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made or
input provided by TEGNA and its legal counsel. Subject to the receipt of the requisite holder consents, in connection
with any or all of the Consent Solicitations, TEGNA shall execute one or more supplemental indentures to the
applicable indenture governing each series of Existing Company Notes in accordance with the terms thereof
amending the terms and provisions of such indenture as described in the applicable Debt Offer

Documents in a form as reasonably requested by Parent, which such supplemental indentures shall become effective
upon the execution thereof but shall not become operative until the Effective Time, and TEGNA shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the trustee under each such indenture to enter into such supplemental indentures. Subject to
the last two paragraphs of the “Debt Financing” section that immediately precedes this section, TEGNA shall, and
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their representatives to,
provide all reasonable and customary cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing to assist
Parent in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations; provided that neither TEGNA nor
counsel for TEGNA shall be required to furnish any certificates, legal opinions or negative assurance letters in
connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitation (other than in connection with the execution of
any supplemental indenture described in the immediately preceding sentence relating to the Consent Solicitations,
with respect to which TEGNA shall deliver customary officer’s certificates and counsel to TEGNA shall provide
customary legal opinions, in each case, to the trustee under each applicable indenture governing each series of
Existing Company Notes and solely to the extent such certificates or legal opinions, as applicable, would not conflict
with applicable laws and would be accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered) or execute
any other instruments or agreements in connection therewith other than any such supplemental indenture described
in the immediately preceding sentence. The solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained
in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected by Parent, retained by
Parent, and their fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent. If, at any time prior to the
completion of the Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, TEGNA or any of its subsidiaries, on the one
hand, or Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party that
discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the
applicable notes, debentures or other debt securities of TEGNA outstanding under the applicable indenture
governing each series of Existing Company Notes.
If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent commencing or closing any Company Note Offer and
Consent Solicitation for any series of Existing Company Notes, TEGNA shall use its reasonable best efforts, to the
extent permitted by such series of Existing Company Notes and the applicable indenture governing such series of
Existing Company Notes, to (A) issue a notice of redemption for all or portion of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of such series of Existing Company Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the applicable indenture
governing such series of Existing Company Notes, which notice of redemption shall be expressly conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing and (B) take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption
and satisfaction and discharge of any series of Existing Company Notes at the Effective Time pursuant to the
redemption and satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable indenture governing such series of Existing
Company Notes and the other provisions of the indenture applicable thereto, provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, no such Redemption shall be effective prior to the Effective Time and provided further that neither TEGNA nor
counsel for TEGNA shall be required to furnish any certificates, legal opinions or negative assurance letters in
connection with any Redemption (except that TEGNA shall deliver customary officers’ certificates and (solely to the
extent the trustee under the applicable indenture governing each series of Existing Company Notes requires an
opinion of counsel to TEGNA) counsel to TEGNA shall provide customary legal opinions, in each case, to the trustee
under each applicable indenture governing each series of Existing Company Notes and solely to the extent such
certificates or legal opinions, as applicable, would not conflict with applicable laws and would be accurate in light of
the facts and circumstances at the time delivered). If a notice of conditional redemption or satisfaction and discharge
is given, Parent shall ensure that at the Effective Time, so long as the applicable conditions of such redemption or
satisfaction and discharge are satisfied, TEGNA has all funds necessary in connection with any such redemption or
satisfaction and discharge. The redemption or satisfaction and discharge of any series of Existing Company Notes
pursuant to this paragraph are referred to collectively as the “Redemption” of such series of Existing Company
Notes.
Subject to the last two paragraphs of the “Debt Financing” section that immediately precedes this section, TEGNA

thereof) on the Closing Date of the Amended and Restated Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Agreement,
dated as of December 13, 2004, and effective as of January 5, 2005, among TEGNA, as borrower, the lenders from time

For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to), to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
directors or officers of TEGNA or any of its subsidiaries and any person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case to the extent
acting in such capacity (collectively, the “Covered Persons”) against any costs and expenses (including advancing
attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Covered Person to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) advance expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses) as incurred by the
Covered Persons in the defense of any proceeding or investigation with respect to the foregoing matters in
accordance with the Company’s organizational documents or any existing indemnification agreements.
In addition, for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will either
cause to be maintained in effect the current directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance policies
maintained by or for the benefit of TEGNA and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and
officers, or provide substitute policies for TEGNA and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of TEGNA and its subsidiaries, of not less than
the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and
officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of
TEGNA and its subsidiaries, and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of TEGNA and its
subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. However,
the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by TEGNA prior to the date of Merger Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as is available for such amount. The foregoing provisions will be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time (which TEGNA shall be permitted to purchase prior to
the Effective Time, subject to the cap described in the preceding sentence), which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

pursuant to the HSR Act and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable.
If, in the Interim Period, an application for the renewal of any FCC license is required to be filed, TEGNA must execute,
file and prosecute the application. Each of Parent and Merger Sub are required to, as a part of the FCC Applications,
request that the FCC apply its policy permitting the transfer of control of FCC licenses in transactions involving
multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more renewal application. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the other Parent Restructuring Entities (if applicable) must make such representations and
undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to assume, as between
the parties hereto and the FCC, the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending renewal
application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such renewal application. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and TEGNA acknowledged that, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the
FCC of any renewal application for any FCC license with respect to any Company Station and thereby to facilitate the
grant of the FCC Consent with respect thereto, each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates, and the
Company and its subsidiaries will be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of
limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Company Station in connection with
(i) any pending complaints that such Company Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or
profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against such Company Station with respect to which the FCC
may permit Parent, Merger Sub or TEGNA (or any of their respective affiliates) to enter into a tolling agreement.
Each of the Parent Entities must, and must cause their respective affiliates to, take all actions necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust laws or the Communications Act so as to cause the
satisfaction of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger with respect to the absence of
any legal restraints prohibiting the Merger, the expiration or termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act
and the receipt of the FCC Consent, so as to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, and in any event
before the Outside Date, including: (i) supplying as promptly as reasonably practicable any information and
documentary materials that may be requested by the FCC or any other governmental entity; (ii) proposing,
negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
disposition of and restriction on the businesses, assets, properties, product lines, and equity interests of, or changes
to the conduct of business of, TEGNA, TEGNA’s subsidiaries, each of the Parent Entities and their respective
affiliates; (iii) creating, terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of TEGNA,
TEGNA’s subsidiaries, each of the Parent Entities or their respective affiliates; (iv) otherwise taking or committing to
take any action that would limit any of TEGNA’s, TEGNA’s

subsidiaries’, Parent Entities’ and their respective affiliates’ freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain
or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of any of the Parent
Entities or their respective affiliates or TEGNA or its subsidiaries; and (v) complying with certain other obligations.
In no event will CMG or its affiliates be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect or agree to (x) the sale,
divestiture, license or hold separate of any business, asset, property, product line, or equity interest of CMG or its
affiliates (other than TEGNA’s stations or of Parent, TEGNA or any of their respective subsidiaries) or (y) certain
behavioral or other operational conditions.
If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement
or any of the Restructuring Agreements as violative of any antitrust law or the Communications Act or other
applicable law, each of TEGNA (solely with respect to proceedings challenging the Merger) and the Parent
Restructuring Entities must use reasonable best efforts to as promptly as practicable contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreements.
Each of the Parent Restructuring Entities must, and must cause their respective controlled affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Restructuring and
any other transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreements as promptly as practicable. Each of the Parent
Restructuring Entities must make or file with the appropriate governmental entity all filings required to be filed to
consummate the Restructuring and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement and the other
Restructuring Agreements and the Parent Restructuring Entities must, and must cause their respective controlled
affiliates to respond to inquiries from governmental entities, or provide any supplemental information that may be
requested by governmental entities. The Parent Restructuring Entities must keep TEGNA apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Restructuring, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period
applicable to the Restructuring under the HSR Act and the receipt of the FCC Consents (as such term is defined in
the Contribution Agreement). In that regard, the Parent Restructuring Entities must (i) promptly provide any
information and assistance as TEGNA may reasonably request with respect to all notices, submissions or filings
made by or on behalf of TEGNA or any of its affiliates with any governmental entity in connection with the
Restructuring or the Restructuring Agreements and (ii) promptly inform TEGNA, and if in writing, furnish TEGNA
with copies of any communication from or to any governmental entity regarding the Restructuring or the
Restructuring Agreements, and permit TEGNA to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views or comments of TEGNA in connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such
governmental entity. No party or any of its affiliates, may participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
governmental entity in connection with the Restructuring or the Restructuring Agreements unless it consults with
the other parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such governmental entity, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Each of the Parent Restructuring Entities has agreed to comply with the
Restructuring Agreements and to not amend, terminate or waive any provision of any of the Restructuring
Agreements, if (x) such amendment, termination or waiver would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of the Restructuring or the Merger or (y) such amendment, termination or
waiver is an amendment, termination or waiver of certain specified sections of the Contribution Agreement, in each
case without the prior written consent of TEGNA. Without TEGNA’s consent, each of the Parent Restructuring
Entities may not (and shall cause their respective controlled affiliates not to) enter into any agreements or
understandings that if entered into on or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement would constitute Restructuring
Agreements or Sierra/Apache Arrangements (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case if any such action
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Restructuring or the Merger, in each case without TEGNA’s prior written consent. To the extent requested with
reasonable clarity by the FCC or the Department of Justice, the applicable Parent

performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly the parties to the

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, TEGNA is required to submit
a proposal to our stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to TEGNA’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Compensation Proposal). This compensation is
summarized in the section captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of TEGNA’s
Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the
named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly,
TEGNA is asking you to approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of TEGNA approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will
or may become payable to TEGNA’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Interests of TEGNA’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.””
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve this
Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on TEGNA. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares present at the Special
Meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in
person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (ii)
abstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a vote against the Compensation
Proposal and (iii) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal.
Shares of TEGNA common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be
voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a TEGNA stockholder returns a signed proxy card
without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of TEGNA common stock represented by that
proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and
all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could
adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit
additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from TEGNA stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment
Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against Merger
Agreement Proposal such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special
Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to
change their votes to votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the
Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future
meetings of stockholders of TEGNA. However, if the Merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
TEGNA expects to hold a 2022 annual meeting of its stockholders.
As described in our annual proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders filed on March 26, 2021,
TEGNA stockholders had the opportunity to submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for

their proposals in writing to our Secretary in a timely manner by November 26, 2021, and otherwise complying with
the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.

annual meeting, including stockholder proposals not included in our proxy statement. For director nominations or
other business to be properly brought before our 2022 annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have
delivered written notice to our Secretary at our principal executive offices no later than January 7, 2022, and no earlier
than January 27, 2022. If the date of our 2022 annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 calendar days or delayed
by more than 60 calendar days from the anniversary date of the 2021 annual meeting, notice of a proposal will be
timely if it is received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices no earlier than the close of business on the
120th day prior to the 2022 annual meeting and not later than the later of the close of business on the 100th day
before the 2022 annual meeting, or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than

The Board of Directors

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of TEGNA Inc. (the “Company”) of the consideration to be
paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly owned subsidiary
(“Merger Sub”) of (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 22, 2022
(the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror, Merger Sub, and, solely for certain provisions specified
therein, the other Parent Restructuring Entities (as defined in the Agreement), the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than Cancelled
Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right
to receive (i) $24.00 in cash (the “Consideration”) plus (ii) if the Transaction has not closed by the date specified in
the Agreement, the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Agreement). We express no opinion on the
Additional Consideration.
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available
business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared
the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial
and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies
we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain
publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts
prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies
and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company, the Investors (as defined in the
Agreement) and the Parent Restructuring Entities (together with the Investors, the “Acquiror Group”) or otherwise
reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,
pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such
independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or
liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or any member of the Acquiror Group under any state
or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on
assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company’s management as to the
expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts
relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have
also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated
as described in the Agreement. We have also assumed that the respective representations and warranties made by
the Company and the members of the Acquiror Group in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be
true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on
the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all
material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the
Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion
and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock
in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection
with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company
or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion
with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee
from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or
investment banking relationships with the Company for which we and such affiliates have received customary
compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt
securities of the Company in September 2020. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor
our affiliates have had any material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking
relationships with Standard General LP, an affiliate of the Acquiror, nor with Community News Media LLC, a portfolio
company of Standard General LP. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had
commercial or investment banking relationships with Apollo Global Management, Inc. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of
certain of the Preferred Securities Investors (as defined in the Agreement), CMG Media Corporation (f/k/a Terrier
Media Buyer, Inc.) (“CMG”), an Apollo portfolio company, and with other Apollo portfolio companies, for which we
and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as
joint lead arranger on an Apollo credit facility in September 2020 and providing debt syndication, debt underwriting
and financial advisory services to Apollo portfolio companies, including having acted as joint lead arranger and
bookrunner on credit facilities of CMG in June 2020 and February 2021. During the two years preceding the date of
this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Ares Management
Corporation (“Ares”), an affiliate of certain of the Preferred Securities Investors, and with Ares portfolio companies
for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have
included acting as joint lead bookrunner on an offering of equity securities of Ares in April 2021 and joint lead
bookrunner on offerings of debt securities of Ares in June 2021 and January 2022 and providing debt syndication,
debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Ares portfolio companies. Our commercial banking affiliate is an
agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Company, Apollo, Apollo portfolio companies and
Ares portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we
and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the
Company, Apollo and Ares. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the
debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the
Company, Apollo or Ares for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time
hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid
to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.

We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information and data publicly available, supplied or otherwise made available to, or reviewed by or discussed with,
us. With respect to the Forecasts, we have assumed that they were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of the Company, and we have relied upon
the Forecasts in arriving at our opinion. We express no opinion with respect to the Forecasts or the assumptions
upon which they are based. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We
have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement,
and without waiver or modification of any terms or conditions the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to
our analysis. We have further assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any effect on the Company or the Merger in
any way meaningful to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have relied on the
assessments made by the Company and the Parent and their respective advisors with respect to such issues. Our

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for rendering
this opinion and for other services rendered in connection with the Merger, a significant portion of which is
contingent on the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain
liabilities arising out of our engagement. As the Company has been advised, during the two years preceding the date
of this opinion we have not been engaged by, performed any services for or received any compensation from the
Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Standard General, Apollo, the other Parent Restructuring Entities or their
respective affiliates, other than the compensation that was paid to us under the letter agreements pursuant to which
we were retained as a financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger. In the two years preceding the
date of this opinion we have been engaged by certain affiliates of Apollo and Ares Management Corporation
(“Ares”) to provide financial advisory services; however, no transactions have ensued and we have not received any
compensation for our engagements from either Apollo or Ares or their affiliates.
It is understood that this letter is solely for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity
as such) (the “Board”) and is rendered to the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and may not
be used for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person without our prior written consent. This opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of Common Stock, as of the date hereof, of
the Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. We are not expressing any
view or opinion as to any other terms or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any agreement or
instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger,
including as to the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration to be received in connection with the Merger, by
holders of any other class of securities, any creditors or any other constituencies of the Company. We are also not
expressing any view or opinion as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or the viability of the Company,
Parent, the Investors (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or the Parent Restructuring Entities or their ability to pay
their respective obligations when they come due. We express no view or opinion with respect to the amount or nature
of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons relative to
the Consideration to be received by the holders of the Common Stock in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of
any such compensation. We also express no view or opinion regarding matters that require legal, regulatory,
accounting, insurance, tax, environmental, executive compensation or other similar professional advice and we
assume that opinions, counsel and interpretations regarding such matters have been or will be obtained from the

appropriate professional sources. This opinion has been approved by our fairness committee. This opinion is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to the members of the Board as to whether they should
approve the Merger or the Merger Agreement or take any other action in connection therewith, nor does it constitute
a recommendation as to how any stockholder of the Company should vote or otherwise act with respect to the
Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, including the limitations and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the
opinion that as of the date hereof the Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

(a) At the Teton Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Teton Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company, Teton Merger Sub or any holder of Company Common Stock or shares of common stock
of Teton Merger Sub:
(i) Common Stock of Teton Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Teton
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. From and after the Teton Merger Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of common stock of Teton Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(ii) Cancellation and Conversion of Certain Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time that is owned by Parent or owned or held
in treasury by the Company, other than shares of Company Common Stock held on behalf of third parties,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (such shares of
Company Common Stock, the “Cancelled Shares”), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Teton
Merger Effective Time that is owned or held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, other than
shares of Company Common Stock held on behalf of third parties, shall be converted into such number of
shares of stock of the Surviving Company such that each such Subsidiary shall own the same percentage
of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Company immediately following the Teton Merger
Effective Time as such
A-14TABLE OF CONTENTS
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time (such shares of
Company Common Stock, the “Converted Shares”).
(iii) Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares,
Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive (A)
$24.00 in cash, without interest, plus (B) the Additional Consideration, if any, without interest (collectively,
the “Merger Consideration”) in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2 (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.2(i)).
Each share of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article III shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Teton
Merger Effective Time, and all Book-Entry Shares and Certificates that, immediately prior to the Teton Merger
Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such shares
have been converted pursuant to this Section 3.1.
(b) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.
(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the
extent required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Converted Shares) and
that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares held
by any such holder (such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Teton Merger Effective Time, any
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be no longer considered Dissenting Shares under this Agreement and shall be treated as if they
had been converted into, at the Teton Merger Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for payment of the Merger
Consideration for such shares. At the Teton Merger Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the previous sentence.
(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice (but in any event within two (2) Business Days of
receipts) of any demands (or threats in writing thereof) received by the Company for appraisals of any
shares of its capital stock under Section 262 of the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands and (B)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may be given,
conditioned or withheld in Parent’s sole discretion), make any payment with respect to any such demands
for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Teton Merger Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall
have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(a) Appointment of Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the
Merger Consideration and shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company
relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities under this Agreement.
(b) Deposit of Merger Consideration. Prior to or as of the Teton Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that are converted in accordance with this Agreement, a cash amount that, when taken together
with any Available Cash which the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent at the Teton Merger Effective
Time (to the extent requested by Parent), is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this Article III (such cash, the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III.
(c) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the fifth Business Day) after the Teton
Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (i) to each holder of record of one or more
Certificates whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii), (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions)
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and (ii) to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii),
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by Parent or the Paying Agent, and each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares,
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Book-Entry Shares (which shall be deemed surrendered upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form or such other evidence as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii), and the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(c), each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Teton Merger Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares. From and after the Teton Merger Effective
Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with Section 3.2(c), without interest and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective
Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger
Effective Time. If, after the Teton Merger Effective Time, any
A-16TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.
(e) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; provided, that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available); provided, further, that no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article
III, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Teton Merger Effective
Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any
net profits resulting from or income arising out of such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company.
(f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or other amounts
received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Teton Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that has not theretofore complied
with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, without any interest thereon.
(g) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company, Teton Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Subject to
applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger
Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article III that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or
such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, Teton Merger Sub and the
Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.
(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment
Fund and subject to Section 3.2(f), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(a) At the Teton Merger Effective Time, and without duplication of Section 3.1(a)(iii), each restricted stock
award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company Restricted Stock Award”) that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled by virtue of
A-17TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Teton Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to
receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than five Business Days) following the Teton Merger Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration (without interest and less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment) with respect to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to
the Teton Merger Effective Time.
(b) At the Teton Merger Effective Time, each time-based restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock (a “Company RSU Award”) and each performance-based restricted stock unit or
performance share award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company PSU Award”), in each
case, whether vested or unvested and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective
Time, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Teton Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than five Business Days)
following the Teton Merger Effective Time, the Merger Consideration (without interest and less such amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment) with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
Award or Company PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time. With respect to each
Company PSU Award, the number of shares subject to such award as of immediately prior to the Teton Merger
Effective Time shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement that
apply upon a “Change in Control” (within the meaning of the applicable award agreement) or, in the case of each
Company PSU Award granted in 2021, such number of shares shall be equal to the greater of (i) the number of
shares determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement that apply upon a
“Change in Control” and (ii) the number of shares that would be paid under such Company PSU Award
assuming the Company’s actual performance versus target performance for 2021 was also achieved for 2022,
with any associated performance determinations to be made by the Leadership Development and Compensation
Committee of the Company Board immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Merger Consideration payable with respect to a Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award
that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be paid at the
earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code.
(c) At the Teton Merger Effective Time, each hypothetical investment in Company Common Stock under the
Deferred Compensation Plan (other than a Company RSU Award) with a value equal to the value of a share of
Company Common Stock (a “Company Phantom Share Unit Award”) shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted by virtue of the Teton Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, into an amount equal to the Merger Consideration with respect to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Phantom Share Unit Award as of immediately prior
to the Teton Merger Effective Time. For clarity, any Company RSU Award or Company Restricted Stock Award
(or right thereto) that has been deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan shall be considered a Company
RSU Award and treated in accordance with Section 3.3(b).
(d) At or prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time, the Company shall adopt appropriate resolutions of the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) approving the treatment of Company Equity Awards contemplated
by this Section 3.3.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a fully executed commitment letter
dated as of the date hereof (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and any fee letter related thereto,
the “Debt Commitment Letter”) from the Debt Financing Parties party thereto pursuant to which such Debt
Financing Parties have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein. The debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is collectively
referred to in this Agreement as the “Debt Financing.”

commitment letter dated as of the date hereof (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the “Preferred
Securities Commitment Letter” and together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the “Commitment Letters”)
from the Preferred Securities Investors pursuant to which the Preferred Securities Investors have agreed, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, to, directly or indirectly, invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein. The
Preferred Securities Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof
and is entitled to enforce such Preferred Securities Commitment Letter. Each Preferred Securities Investor has
sufficient cash, available lines of credit, capital commitments or other sources of available funds to satisfy the
full amount of its commitment under the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter. The cash committed pursuant to
the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Preferred
Securities Financing.” The Preferred Securities Financing and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to in
this Agreement as the “Financing”.

redaction solely of fee amounts, securities demand, “flex terms”, other economic terms and other provisions

Financing below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Amount (after taking into account the amount of

letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing Parties or the Preferred
Securities Investors to provide the Financing that would permit the Debt Financing Parties or the Preferred
Securities Investors to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing below an amount necessary to
satisfy the Financing Amount, including any condition relating to the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing pursuant to any “flex” provision. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the
Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have knowledge that any of the Debt
Financing Parties or the Preferred Securities Investors will not perform its obligations thereunder, as applicable.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements of any kind to which Parent or Teton Merger Sub is a party relating to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing required to fund the Financing Amount, other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letters and, in each case, with respect to the Debt Financing, the unredacted
portions of any fee letters and other than customary engagement letters and customary fee credit letters (in each
case, the terms of which do not (i) reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to fund
the Financing Amount or (ii) impose any new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely amend, modify or
expand any conditions precedent to the Debt Financing).

IV and (y) the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement in all material respects, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters

fees and original issue discount) shall provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parent’s payment obligations under this Agreement and the Commitment Letters, including
the payment of the Merger Consideration, the payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired,
cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Teton Merger (including the
Payoff Amount), and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, any of the other Parent Restructuring
Entities, any of the Investors or any of their respective Affiliates, in each case required to be paid on the Closing
Date by Parent or Teton Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (such amounts,
collectively, the “Financing Amount”).
(f) As of the date of this Agreement, each of the Commitment Letters constitutes the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, all the other parties thereto and is in full force
and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time
or both) would constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent under the terms and conditions of
any Commitment Letter, and, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that the
Financing will not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing in an amount necessary to satisfy the
Financing Amount. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of each Commitment Letter on or before the date hereof, and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date. Except in accordance with the terms hereof, the Commitment Letters
have not been modified, amended or altered and, as of the date of this Agreement, none of the respective
commitments thereunder have been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, no termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission
thereof is contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, no modification or amendment to the Commitment
Letters is contemplated (other than, in accordance with Section 6.15(c), to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement).

(a) The Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice to the Company, throughout the period from the date hereof until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement and the Teton Merger Effective Time, to its and its Subsidiaries’ personnel,
properties, assets, Contracts, commitments, books and records and such other information concerning its
business, properties, finances, operations, assets, litigation matters, environmental compliance matters, cash-
flow reports and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parent’s
Representatives in connection with such access and examination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 6.2(a), any document, correspondence or information or other access provided
pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) may be redacted or otherwise limited to prevent disclosure of information
concerning the valuation of the Company and Teton Merger or other similarly confidential or competitively
sensitive information. All access pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) shall be (i) conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) coordinated
through the General Counsel of the Company or a designee thereof.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.2, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any access, or make available any document, correspondence or
information, if doing so would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company’s legal counsel, (i) jeopardize or
cause a risk of loss or waiver of the attorney-client, attorney work product or other similar privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) violate any (A) Law applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the business, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
any COVID-19 Measures) or (B) Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their assets or properties are bound; provided, that in such instances the Company shall inform Parent of
the general nature of the information being withheld and, on Parent’s request, reasonably cooperate with the
other party to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the
outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).
(c) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or their respective Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
A-41TABLE OF CONTENTS
hereby shall be governed in accordance with (i) the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2021,
between the Company and Sierra (the “Sierra Confidentiality Agreement”) and (ii) the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of February 24, 2020, as amended on July 24, 2021, between the Company and Apache (the

terms.

best efforts to cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates, including making any necessary filings with the FCC and

interests in Premion, LLC, and equity interests in Madhive, Inc. from Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to CMG or
an Affiliate of CMG as designated by Parent (such assignments or transfers, the “Post-Closing Transfers” )
provided, however, that in no event shall any filings be made with the FCC or under the HSR Act that would
have the effect of making the Closing contingent on any of the Post-Closing Transfers or the approval thereof
(provided that a filing requested by the FCC or its staff in order to grant the FCC Consent shall be permitted if
made to comply with the obligations set forth in Section 6.6(e), so long as the Parent Restructuring Entities
continue to comply in all respects with Section 6.6 and any conditions of such divestiture (other than FCC or
HSR approval or the closing of the Merger) shall be irrevocably waived). In no event shall the receipt or
approval or clearance from the FCC or under the HSR Act for any Post-Closing Transfer (or the completion of
any Post-Closing Transfer) be, directly or indirectly, a condition to any of Parent’s or Teton Merger Sub’s
obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall the receipt or failure to receive any approvals with respect
to, or the consummation or potential consummation of, any of the transactions contemplated by this Section
6.2(d) be, directly or indirectly, a condition to any of Parent’s or Teton Merger Sub’s (or any of the other Parent
Restructuring Entities’) obligations under this Agreement.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit and use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and
their respective officers, directors and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any proposal or offer or any inquiries regarding the making of any proposal or
offer, including any proposal or offer to its stockholders, that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information, or provide or afford access to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, books and records, assets, facilities or personnel, in

or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than, in response to an
unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this Section 6.3 and to limit its conversation or other
communication exclusively to such referral), (iii) enter into, or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture
agreement or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (iv) authorize, commit or resolve to do any of
the foregoing; provided, that the Company and its Representatives shall be permitted, upon a good faith
determination by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that not doing so would
be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law, to grant a
confidential waiver of any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement solely to permit a Company
Takeover Proposal to be made and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, negotiated and entered into.
(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its Representatives to,
immediately (i) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than

Affiliates and Representatives) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) terminate
access for any Person (other than Parent, Teton Merger Sub, the other Parent Restructuring Entities, the
Investors and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) to any data room and (iii) request the return or
destruction of any non-public information provided to any Person (other than Parent, Teton Merger Sub the
other Parent Restructuring Entities, the Investors and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) in
connection with a potential Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not release any third party from, or
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality provision
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or similar matter in any agreement to which the Company is a
party; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may take such actions solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Company
Takeover Proposal and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, thereafter negotiate and enter into any
transaction in connection therewith.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal from any Person, and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal, then the
Company may enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal and the Company and its Representatives may (i) furnish, pursuant to an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and such Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal, information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person that has made such
Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with such Person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding
such Company Takeover Proposal; provided, that promptly after (and in any event within 48 hours of)
furnishing any non-public information after the date of this Agreement about the Company and its Subsidiaries
to such Person making such Company Takeover Proposal, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if the
Company takes any of the actions in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing in
the event that the Company or any of its controlled Affiliates or Representatives (on the Company’s behalf)
receives, after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal, inquiry or
request for information or discussions relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that contemplates or that
would reasonably be likely to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall indicate (to the extent
permitted by existing contractual obligations) the identity of the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal
or offer, proposal, inquiry or request, and the material terms and conditions thereof and, if written, a copy
thereof. In addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) after the receipt thereof
provide to Parent (to the extent permitted by existing contractual obligations) copies of any material written
documentation setting forth the material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal which is received by the
Company from the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (or from any Representatives of such
Person).

Company, make any public statement approving, endorsing or recommending, or resolve to approve or

Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 6.3(c)) (a “Company Acquisition
Agreement”) or (iii)submit any Company Takeover Proposal to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, in
response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that
prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the Company has given Parent at least
four Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor and the Intervening Event, (2) during such four Business Day period, has negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (if Parent and its Representatives desire to so negotiate) to make
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (3) upon the end of such notice period, the
Company Board shall have considered any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by, and
that are legally binding on, Parent, Teton Merger Sub and the other Parent Restructuring Entities, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a bona fide written
Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
Board may (A) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Company Superior
Proposal or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h) in order to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal; provided, that prior to so making
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, (1) the Company has given Parent
at least four Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, including the material terms
and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any proposed
Company Acquisition Agreements related to such Company Superior Proposal, (2) at the end of such notice
period, the Company Board shall have considered any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by, and that are legally binding on, Parent, Teton Merger Sub and the other Parent Restructuring Entities,
and shall have determined, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if
the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (3) in the event of any change to any of the
financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above of this proviso
and a new two (2) Business Day notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence during which
time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(f) anew with respect to
such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (3) above of this proviso.
(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (it being understood that such action may
constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of Section 8.1(g) if it otherwise satisfies
the definition thereof), (ii) from making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that
the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
applicable Law (it being understood that such action may constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change for purposes of Section 8.1(g) if it otherwise satisfies the definition thereof).

postponement thereof) any information relating to Parent (or any other Parent Restructuring Entities) or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, or the Investors, is discovered by Parent or
the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and, to the extent

(a) Effective as of the Teton Merger Effective Time and during the one-year period immediately following the
Teton Merger Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to provide, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by
Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Teton Merger Effective
Time (collectively, the “Company Employees”), (a) a total target compensation opportunity (composed of base
compensation and short- and long-term incentive target opportunity) that, in the aggregate, is no less favorable
than that provided immediately before the Teton Merger Effective Time, provided that a Company Employee’s
base compensation shall not be reduced from that in effect immediately before the Teton Merger Effective Time
and (b) all other compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than were
provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Teton Merger Effective Time (in each case without
regard to sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, or transaction-based compensation). In addition, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each Company Employee whose employment is
involuntarily terminated by the Company during the Continuation Period, severance benefits no less favorable
than the greater of the severance benefits that would have been provided to the Company Employee under the
Company’s severance arrangements or practices in effect immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time
or the severance benefits due under the applicable severance plan of Parent (it being understood that this
sentence does not limit the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company to honor the terms of any Company
Benefit Plan providing severance benefits as then in effect). In addition, effective as of the Teton Merger
Effective Time and during the one-year period immediately following the Teton Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, comply with the terms of Section 6.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.
(b) Immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time, the Company shall pay to each Company Employee
(b) Immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time, the Company shall pay to each Company Employee
who is then participating in any bonus or incentive plans maintained by the Company with respect to the
Company’s fiscal year (or such shorter performance period) during which the Closing occurs (the “Bonus
Plans”), a prorated incentive award under the Bonus Plans for the period from the beginning of the applicable
performance period through the Closing Date (the “Bonus Period”) equal to the greater of (i) such employee’s
incentive entitlement for the Bonus Period under the Bonus Plans based on the actual level of achievement of
the applicable performance goals for the period beginning on the first day of such applicable performance period
and ending as of the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Teton Merger Effective
Time occurs (with such determination of performance to exclude any costs relating to the Teton Merger, as
applicable), as determined in good faith by the Company Board (or the authorized committee thereof), and (ii)
such employee’s incentive entitlement for the Bonus Period under the Bonus Plans assuming target level
performance is achieved. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Teton Merger
Effective Time has not occurred prior to January 1, 2023, annual bonuses for the Company’s 2022 fiscal year
shall be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence as if the Closing had occurred immediately prior
to the conclusion of such fiscal year, and shall be paid immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time (or,
if earlier, at the Company’s election, at such time as they would be paid in the ordinary course of business). The
Surviving Company shall establish bonus and incentive plans with respect to the remainder of the fiscal year in
which the Teton Merger Effective Time occurs on terms consistent with Section 6.5(a).

(c) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause any employee
benefit or compensation plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company or their
Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date (collectively,
the “Post-Closing Plans”) to recognize the service of each Company Employee with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor thereto) prior to the Closing Date for all purposes, except to the extent it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that
provides welfare benefits, for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate,
Parent shall (i) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be
waived with respect to such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents to the extent such limitation
would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time and (ii) credit each Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by such Company Employee and his or
her eligible dependents in such plan year for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket
expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any
annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable
plan.
(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to any Company Employees who
are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, Parent’s obligations under this Section 6.5 shall apply only
to the extent not inconsistent with any obligations under the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
(e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” or “change of control” of the Company or other
event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans that contain such terms, will occur
upon the Teton Merger Effective Time.
(f) With respect to any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose employment is transferred
pursuant to a divestiture, sale or other transaction in connection with the Teton Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Restructuring Agreements, including as contemplated by
Section 6.6 (any such transaction, a “Divestiture” and any such employee, a “Divested Employee”), the Parent
Restructuring Entities shall ensure that the transaction agreement governing such Divestiture with respect to
the Post-Closing Transfers (and shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transaction agreements
governing other Divestitures) shall include an employee matters covenant providing for compensation and
benefits of such Divested Employee during the one-year period following the closing of such Divestiture on
terms that are no less favorable than the terms applicable to a Continuing Employee under this Section 6.5
(including the Company Disclosure Schedules hereto).
(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other service provider any right to
continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any
“employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any
other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.5 shall create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or
its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

take the lead, in advance consultation and cooperation with the Company, in the development and
implementation of the strategy for obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any

each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any sensitive materials provided to the other under
this Section 6.6(b) as “Outside Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient or its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (any of the Parent Entities or the Company, as the case may be).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.6, materials provided pursuant to this
Section 6.6 may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Teton

respects. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) the Company, Parent and each applicable
Parent Restructuring Entity shall jointly file (and, if applicable, the Parent Restructuring Entities shall cause the
Investors and their respective Affiliates to be included in) the FCC Applications no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement; (ii) until such time as the FCC Consent shall have been obtained, each of

petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the FCC Applications to the extent such petition or
objection relates to such party; (iii) the Parent Restructuring Entities shall (and shall, if applicable, cause the

compliance with clause (iii) in this Section 6.6(c)), the Investors and their respective Affiliates) shall not take any

Affiliates shall (and, for purposes of compliance with clause (iii) in this Section 6.6(c), the applicable Parent

shall (and, if applicable, the Parent Restructuring Entities shall cause the Investors and their respective Affiliates

(a “Renewal Application”) is required to be filed pursuant to the Communications Act and FCC Rules, the
Company shall execute, file and prosecute with the FCC such Renewal Application with respect to such FCC
license. If an FCC Application is granted by the FCC subject to a renewal condition, then the term “FCC
Consent” shall, for all purposes hereunder, thereafter be deemed to also include satisfaction of such renewal

Merger Sub shall, as a part of the FCC Applications, request that the FCC apply its policy permitting the transfer
of control of FCC licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency
of one or more Renewal Applications. Each of the Parent and Teton Merger Sub and the other Parent
Restructuring Entities (if applicable) shall make such representations and undertakings as are necessary or
appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to assume, as between the parties hereto and the
FCC, the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to
assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application. Each of Parent, Teton
Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the
FCC of any Renewal Application and thereby to facilitate the grant of

Affiliates, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC
to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such
Company Station in connection with (i) any pending complaints that such Company Station aired programming
that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against such
Company Station with respect to which the FCC may permit Parent, Teton Merger Sub or the Company (or any
of their respective Affiliates) to enter into a tolling agreement.

Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including for this purpose, with respect to clause (i)

eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws or the Communications Act so as to cause the
satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 7.1(b) and 7.1(c) so as to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Outside Date, including: (i) supplying as promptly as reasonably
practicable any information and documentary materials that may be requested by the FCC or any other
Governmental Entity; (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree,
hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, behavioral or other operational

Company and its Subsidiaries); (iv) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit any of the
Company’s, the Company’s Subsidiaries’, Parent Entities’ and their respective Affiliates’ (including the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold,
directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of any of the Parent
Entities or their respective Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries); and (v) complying with their respective obligations set forth on Section 6.6(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. If requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to any action contemplated by this
Section 6.6; provided, that any such agreement or action is conditioned on the consummation of the Teton
Merger. Without in any way limiting the Parent Entities’ and their respective Affiliates’ obligations under this
Agreement, in no event shall the Company (and the Company shall not permit any of its Affiliates to) propose,
negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions without the prior written consent of Parent.

contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall CMG or its Affiliates (in each case other than Parent or Teton
Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries) be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect or agree to (x)
the sale, divestiture, license or hold separate of any business, asset, property, product line, or equity interest of

(or Surviving Company) or any of their respective Subsidiaries), or (y) behavioral or other operational
conditions set forth on Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (it being understood, for the

Section 6.6 to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall CNM, CMG or their respective Affiliates be
required to take any action set forth in Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule except as explicitly set

of Section 6.6(e) and any behavioral or other operational conditions that are included in Section 6.6(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply to any business, asset, property, product line or equity interest of
CMG or its Affiliates (in each case other than Parent or Teton Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or as
set forth in Section 6.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as set forth in Section 6.6(c)(iii) or as set in the
last two sentences of Section 6.6(h), including as forth in Section 6.6(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).
(g) In furtherance and not in limitation of their obligations set forth in this Agreement, but subject to Section
6.6(f), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is

defined in the Contribution Agreement). In that regard, the Parent Restructuring Entities shall (i) promptly
provide any information and assistance as the Company may reasonably request with respect to all notices,
submissions or filings made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates (including for such

Agreements (in advance, in the case of communications to any Governmental Entity), and permit the Company
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views or comments of the Company in
connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity. No party or

terminate or waive any provision of any of the Restructuring Agreements, if (x) such amendment, termination or
waiver would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the

enter into any contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements, instruments, obligations or understandings,

prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Restructuring or the Teton Merger, in
each case without the prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Parent Restructuring Entities agrees to, and agrees to cause its applicable Affiliates to,

Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Teton Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the
fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the process resulting in and
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
From and after the Teton Merger Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Company shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to) advance expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(a) in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth in the
Company Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or other organizational or
governance documents, of any Subsidiary of the Company, and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date of this Agreement; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or
otherwise, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(a). In the
event of any such Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Company shall have the right to control the defense thereof
after the Teton Merger Effective Time; (B) each Covered Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel
(the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Company), whether
or not the Surviving Company elects to control the defense of any such Proceeding; and (C) no Covered Person
shall be liable for any settlement of such Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless
such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Company is entirely responsible).
(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Teton Merger Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the
Teton Merger Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Organizational Documents.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
or after the Teton Merger Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters subject to
indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Teton Merger Effective Time, the provisions
of this Section 6.9(b) shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.
Following the Teton Merger Effective Time, the indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any its Subsidiaries shall be
assumed by the Surviving Company, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.
(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Teton Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and
officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the
benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Teton Merger
Effective Time, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to
the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Teton Merger Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers
having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’, employment practices and
fiduciary liability insurance) (the “D&O Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, that the Surviving
Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as is available for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time
(which the Company shall be permitted to purchase prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time, subject to the cap
A-53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
described in the preceding sentence), which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of at least six (6) years from and after the Teton Merger Effective Time with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Teton Merger Effective Time, including in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Teton
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made
so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.
(e) The obligations under this Section 6.9 shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to
the Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that the Covered
Persons (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9.
In the event of any breach by the Surviving Company or Parent of this Section 6.9, the Surviving Company shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.9 as such fees are incurred, upon the written
request of such Covered Person.

within their (or any of their respective controlled Affiliates’) control (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the
waiver of conditions applicable to Parent and Teton Merger Sub contained in the Commitment Letters and such
Definitive Agreements) and comply with its obligations thereunder. Parent and Teton Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to comply with their obligations, and enforce their rights, under the
Commitment Letters and Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, in the event that all conditions contained in any Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements (other than the consummation of the Teton Merger, those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied or waived at Closing, but which conditions are capable of being satisfied, and, with respect to the Debt
Financing, the availability of the Preferred Securities Financing) have been satisfied or waived, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Parties and Preferred Securities Investors, as applicable,
to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the Financing.
(b) Parent shall not without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing)
conditions to the consummation of the Financing required to satisfy the Financing Amount, (B) reduces the

amended or modified debt financing obtained in compliance herewith.
(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor,
Parent will (i) subject to Section 6.15(d)(ii) below, use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the
available portion of the Financing, to pay the Financing Amount) from the same or other sources on terms and
conditions (including market “flex” provisions) that are not materially less favorable to Parent and Teton Merger
Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (after giving
effect to any market “flex” provisions therein) and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and
the reason therefor. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (A) any portion of
the Debt Financing structured as permanent financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, (B) all
conditions contained in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than (x) any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions are capable of being
satisfied, and (y) those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach of this
Agreement by Parent or any of the other Parent Restructuring Entities with respect to the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements applicable to Parent, the other Parent Restructuring Entities or their
respective Affiliates contained in this Agreement) and (C) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.15(c)) are available
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, then Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used promptly in lieu of such affected portion of
the permanent financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be
deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt financing
arranged in compliance herewith and the term “Debt Financing” shall be deemed to include any alternative debt
financing obtained in compliance herewith. Parent shall provide the Company with prompt notice in writing of
any actual or threatened (in writing) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt

other written communication from any Debt Financing Party or other financing source with respect to any such
actual or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any

the Financing Amount (giving effect, on the Closing Date, to the amount of Available Cash), (B) adversely affect
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements or (C) prevent, impede or materially delay the Closing. Parent shall, upon the request of the
Company, keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate
the Debt Financing.

Teton Merger Sub, the other Parent Restructuring Entities, the Investors or any of their respective Affiliates be a
condition to any of Parent’s or Teton Merger Sub’s (or any of the other Parent Restructuring Entities’)
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 6.15 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or
Teton Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Teton Merger Sub to (i) seek the Preferred
Securities Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any material fees, original issue discount
or interest coupons, as applicable, or agree to any prepayment premiums, in each case, in excess of those
contemplated by the Preferred Securities Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter (after giving effect

on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing Date; provided, that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the markets (it being

the terms thereof amending the terms and provisions of such Indenture as described in the applicable Debt Offer
Documents in a form as reasonably requested by Parent (each, a “Company Supplemental Indenture”), which
such supplemental indentures shall become effective upon the execution thereof but shall not become operative
until the Teton Merger Effective Time, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee

Representatives to, provide all reasonable and customary cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in writing to assist Parent in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations;

its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party

appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated to
the holders of the applicable notes, debentures or other debt securities of the Company outstanding under the
applicable Indenture.

doubt, no such Redemption (as defined below) shall be effective prior to the Teton Merger Effective Time and
provided further that neither the Company nor counsel for the Company shall be required to furnish any
certificates, legal opinions or negative assurance letters in connection with any Redemption (except that the

Company) counsel to the Company shall provide customary legal opinions, in each case, to the trustee under
each applicable Indenture and solely to the extent such certificates or legal opinions, as applicable, would not
conflict with applicable Laws and would be accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time

at the Teton Merger Effective Time, so long as the applicable conditions of such redemption or satisfaction and
discharge are satisfied, the Company has all funds necessary in connection with any such redemption or
satisfaction and discharge. The redemption or satisfaction and discharge of any series of Existing Company
Notes pursuant to this clause (b) are referred to collectively as the “Redemption” of such series of Existing
Company Notes.
(c) Subject to Section 6.16(d), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver, in each case, prior
to the Closing Date (and as more specifically stated below), all notices and to take all other actions reasonably
requested by Parent to facilitate (A) the repayment in full on the Closing Date (or in the case of any letters of
credit, cash collateralization, to the extent Parent shall not have entered into an alternative arrangement with the
issuing bank) of all amounts and other obligations then outstanding under and (B) the termination (to the extent
provided therein and pursuant to the terms thereof) on the Closing Date of (such repayments and terminations,
the “Existing Credit Facilities Termination”) the Credit Agreement, including by providing to the Parent a
payoff letter from the agent under the Credit Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, which payoff letter shall, among other things, (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties and any other monetary obligations then due and
payable under the Credit Agreement (the “Payoff Amount”), (ii) provide that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount
under the payoff letter, such indebtedness and all related loan documents (or similar agreements) shall be
terminated and (iii) provide that all security interests (if any) granted to secure the obligations under the Credit
Agreement and guarantees by Subsidiaries of the Company under the Credit Agreement shall be released and
terminated upon receipt of the Payoff Amount. Parent shall provide all funds required to effect the Existing
Credit Facilities Termination; provided that the Existing Credit Facilities Termination and any notices related
thereto shall be expressly conditioned on the Closing.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.15 or this Section 6.16,
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to (i) take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to Section 6.15 or this Section 6.16 that (A) would require the Company, its Affiliates or any Persons
who are directors or officers of the Company or its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives to pass
resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, any Company Note Offers

instance the Company shall inform Parent of the general nature of the information being withheld and, on
Parent’s request, reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a
manner that would not result in any of the outcome described in this clause (ii); (iii) without otherwise limiting

otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Affiliates, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Debt Financing or to commence any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations. Parent
and Teton Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company or any of its Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by them or their respective Representatives in connection
with such cooperation pursuant to Section 6.2(d), Section 6.15 and this Section 6.16 (whether or not the Teton

or any Redemption, any action taken by them at the request of Parent or its representatives pursuant to Section
6.2(d), Section 6.15 and this Section 6.16 and any information used in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives), in each case, except
to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material

(i) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(i),
then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Financing Termination Fee in immediately available funds
within one Business Day of such termination.
(ii) If this Agreement (A) is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and, at the time of such
termination, any condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) (solely as it relates to any Antitrust Law or the
Communications Act or if the order or injunction arises under any Antitrust Law or the Communications
Act) or in Section 7.1(c) has not been satisfied, but all other conditions to the Closing set forth in Section
7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than (x) those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions are capable of being satisfied and (y) those conditions the
failure of which to be satisfied is primarily attributable to a breach by Parent, Teton Merger Sub or the other
Parent Restructuring Entities of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement), (B) is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) (solely if based on an Order arising
under any Antitrust Law or the Communications Act) or pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), or (C) is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) due to Parent’s or
A-65TABLE OF CONTENTS
Teton Merger Sub’s or any other Parent Restructuring Entity’s breach of Section 6.6 which breach results
in any condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) (solely as it relates to any Antitrust Law or the Communication
Act or if the Order arises under any Antitrust Law or the Communications Act) or in Section 7.1(c) being
incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee (x) in the case of any such termination by Parent, in immediately available
funds prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination or (y) in the case of any such
termination by the Company, within one Business Day of such termination.
(iii) In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Financing Termination Fee or the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion, or to pay both the Parent Financing Termination
Fee and the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the
Parent Financing Termination Fee and the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee both are payable, in each
case, in accordance with Section 8.3(b), the higher of the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee and the Parent
Financing Termination Fee shall be payable.
(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that none of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Financing
Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee is intended to be a penalty but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee, Parent Financing Termination Fee or Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee, as applicable, is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that in no event will the Company
or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Financing Termination Fee or the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination
Fee, the Parent Financing Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, may be
payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the
occurrence of different events (it being agreed that if the Parent Financing Termination Fee and the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee both are payable, in each case, in accordance with Section 8.3(b), the higher of the
Parent Regulatory Termination Fee and the Parent Financing Termination Fee shall be payable ).
(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and
Teton Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely
manner the Company Termination Fee, or if Parent fails to pay in a timely manner the Parent Financing
Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, then the Company shall pay to Parent,
or Parent shall pay to the Company, as applicable, interest on such amount from and including the date payment
of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2% per annum (the “Enforcement
Expenses”).
(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, (A) the Parent Financing Termination
Fee or the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with Section
8.3(b), from and after such termination and payment of the Parent Financing Termination Fee or the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, in full pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.3(b), none
of the Parent Related Parties or the Debt Financing Related Parties will have any further Liability to any of

2. Amendments to Section 1.1.
(a) The definition of “FCC Applications” in Section 1.1 of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
(a) The definition of “FCC Applications” in Section 1.1 of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
in its entirety and replacing it as follows:
““FCC Applications” means those applications (including the Petition for Declaratory Ruling) required to be

with respect to any of the Post-Closing Transfers, the applicable Post-Closing Transfer(s) shall be excluded from
this definition of FCC Applications.”
(b) Section 1.1 of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following definition after the
definition of “Person”:
““Post-Closing Transfer Agreements” means all agreements and instruments entered into by the Parent
Restructuring Entities in connection with the Post-Closing Transfers, including those set forth on Annex A

3. Amendment to Section 6.6. Section 6.6 of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended to include a new subclause (k)
as follows:
“(k) For purposes of this Agreement, a “Post-Closing Transfer Restriction” shall have occurred if the FCC (or its
staff) conveys to the parties with reasonable clarity that it will not grant the FCC Applications as a result of any of
the Post-Closing Transfers or any of the Post-Closing Transfers do not receive HSR clearance after filing the
necessary notification and report forms under the HSR Act and observing the applicable waiting period or extensions
thereof. Upon the occurrence of a Post-Closing Transfer Restriction, (i) the applicable Post-Closing Transfer(s) will be
excluded from the FCC Applications and the parties shall immediately withdraw, file, or amend the FCC Applications
and any other related filings to give effect to this change (for clarity, in order to authorize the Merger without such
Post-Closing Transfer(s)) and (ii) the Parent Restructuring Entities shall be required to comply with this Section 6.6
without relying on such Post-Closing Transfer(s). The Post-Closing Transfer Agreement Parties hereby agree that the
Post-Closing Transfer Agreements shall specify (and shall, to the extent already entered into prior to the date hereof,
be amended effective as of the date hereof to specify) that: (A) there shall be no conditions to the obligations of the
Post-Closing Transfer Agreement Parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
applicable Post-Closing Transfer Agreements, other than (x) the approvals by the FCC and the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act of the applicable Post-Closing
Transfers and (y) the consummation of the Teton Merger, (B) there shall be no rights of the Post-Closing Transfer
Agreement Parties (or any other person) to terminate any Post-Closing Transfer Agreements other than upon the
valid termination of the Merger Agreement and (C) Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of the Contribution Agreement shall apply,
mutatis mutandis, to the Post-Closing Transfers, the Post-Closing Transfer Agreement Parties and the Post-Closing
Transfer Agreements, in each case, subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth therein.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
4. Amendment to Section 6.6. Section 6.6 of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended to include a new subclause (l)
as follows:
“(l) For purposes of this Section 6.6, (A) unless a Post-Closing Transfer Restriction has occurred and (B) except with
respect to any obligation to consummate or make effective the Post-Closing Transfers prior to the Closing, (i) the
definition of “Restructuring” shall include the Post-Closing Transfers, (ii) the definition of “Restructuring
Agreements” shall include the Post-Closing Transfer Agreements and (iii) the definition of “Parent Restructuring
Entities” shall include the Post Closing Transfer Agreement Parties, and, for the avoidance of doubt, each of the
Post-Closing Transfer Agreement Parties agrees to comply with all obligations of the Parent Restructuring Entities
contained in this Section 6.6 to the extent they apply to the Post-Closing Transfers and Post-Closing Transfer
Agreements after giving effect to this Section 6.6(l) (for clarity, to the same extent as the Parent Restructuring Entities
are required to comply with their obligations with respect to the Restructuring and the Restructuring Agreements).
Without limiting the foregoing, without the Company’s prior written consent, each of the Post Closing Transfer
Agreement Parties agrees to not amend, terminate or waive any provision of any of the Post-Closing Transfer
Agreements if such amendment, termination or waiver is an amendment, termination or waiver of any section of the
Post-Closing Transfer Agreements that relates to efforts to obtain regulatory approvals, closing conditions or the
termination right of any party thereto.”
5. Amendment to Section 6.2(d). Section 6.2(d) of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended to include a new proviso
at the end of the first sentence thereof as follows:
“; provided further that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in any Post-Closing Transfer
Agreement to the contrary, the VHF Assets (as defined in that certain Option Agreement, dated as of September
18, 2020, by and between Estrella Media, Inc. and WFAA-TV, Inc.) shall be excluded from (and shall not be a part
of) any Post-Closing Transfer and any Post-Closing Transfer Agreement unless and until the Company provides
its prior written consent for such VHF Assets to be included as part of the Post-Closing Transfers.”
6. Joinder. In consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements and covenants set forth herein and in the
Merger Agreement, each of the Post-Closing Transfer Agreement Parties agrees to make the representations, and to
comply with each of the covenants and obligations, applicable to the Post-Closing Transfer Agreement Parties (and
where applicable, the Parent Restructuring Entities) as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
7. Merger Agreement Remains in Effect. Except as expressly amended by this Amendment, the Merger Agreement
remains in full force and effect and nothing in this Amendment shall otherwise affect any other provision of the
Merger Agreement or the rights and obligations of the Parties. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parent
Restructuring Entities agrees that nothing in this Amendment shall limit in any way any of the provisions of the
Merger Agreement, including Section 6.6 thereof.
8. References to the Merger Agreement. After giving effect to this Amendment, each reference in the Merger
Agreement to “this Agreement,” “hereof,” “hereunder” or words of like import referring to the Merger Agreement
shall refer to the Merger Agreement as amended by this Amendment.
9. Incorporation by Reference. Sections 9.3 (Counterparts; Effectiveness), 9.4 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction), 9.6
(WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL), 9.7 (Notices), 9.9 (Severability), 9.12 (Headings), 9.15 (Interpretation) and 9.17 (Non-
