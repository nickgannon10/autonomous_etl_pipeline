This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the
“Company”) Board of Directors (the “iRobot board of directors”) for use at the special meeting to be held virtually on October 17, 2022, at 8:30 a.m.
Eastern Time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof (the “special meeting”). The Company will hold the special meeting virtually via the
Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/IRBT2022SM (the “virtual meeting website”). You will not be able to attend the special meeting
physically in person.

IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Purposes of the Special Meeting,"Purposes of the Special Meeting
At the special meeting, iRobot stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 4, 2022, by and among Amazon.com, Inc.
(“Amazon.com”), Martin Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) and the Company, as it may be amended from time to time (the “merger
agreement”);
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” (the “compensation
proposal”); and
•
to approve the adjournment from time to time of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement (the
“adjournment proposal”).
Our stockholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve and adopt the
merger agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the material
provisions of the merger agreement are described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a
stockholder may vote to approve the compensation proposal and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the
vote on the compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Amazon.com. Accordingly, if the
merger agreement is approved by the Company’s stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the
Company’s executive officers even if the stockholders fail to approve the compensation proposal.

iRobot does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and only
the matters specified in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at the special meeting.
This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about September 7, 2022, and the mailing
is expected to be completed on or about September 14, 2022.",9,10
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Record Date and Quorum,"Record Date and Quorum
The holders of record of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (referred to in this proxy statement as “common stock,”
“Company common stock” or “iRobot common stock”) as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 27,233,499 shares of common stock were
outstanding.
A majority of the shares entitled to vote, present virtually or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. Once a
share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. However, if a new
record date is set for an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will
be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name” and
do not give any instruction to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the special meeting, those shares will
not be entitled to vote on any proposal at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Required Vote",10,10
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Required Vote,"Required Vote
Each share of iRobot common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to
be considered at the special meeting.
For the Company to complete the merger, iRobot stockholders holding a majority of the shares of iRobot common stock outstanding at the
close of business on the record date must vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of
common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.
Approval of each of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly
cast for and against such proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting. An abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure
to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have no
effect on these proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).
Voting by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers",10,10
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Voting by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers,"Voting by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of the Company were entitled to vote approximately 398,481
shares of iRobot common stock, or approximately 1.46% of the shares of iRobot common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently
expect that the Company’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Attendance
All holders of shares of iRobot common stock as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date, including stockholders of
record and beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited virtually to attend the
special meeting.
To attend the special meeting virtually, you must provide proof of ownership of iRobot common stock as of the close of business on the
record date. If you hold your shares in “street name,” and you also wish to be able to vote virtually at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy,
executed in your favor, from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Voting Virtually
If you plan to virtually attend the special meeting and wish to vote virtually, you will be given a virtual ballot at the special meeting. If you are
not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of iRobot common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are
encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting. If you virtually attend the special meeting and vote by virtual
ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of iRobot common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions
promptly by proxy, even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting
instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the
enclosed proxy card. Your shares of iRobot common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and
returned your proxy card, as described below.
Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special
meeting, your shares of iRobot common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal
to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. If you fail to return your proxy card and you
are a holder of record on the record date, unless you virtually attend the special meeting and vote virtually, the effect will be that your shares of
iRobot common stock will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special
meeting, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is
present, will not affect the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
3Table of Contents
Shares of iRobot Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of iRobot common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,” your broker, bank or other
nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for
their customers to provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction
form.
In accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”), brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of
common stock in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not
receive specific voting instructions with respect to these proposals from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with
respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you virtually attend the special meeting with a properly executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or
other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of iRobot common stock not
being deemed present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and not being voted on any of the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, if a beneficial owner of shares held in
street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as
to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the
special meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to
any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:
•
submitting a new proxy dated after the date of the proxy being revoked, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission
procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company, in each case, in
accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
virtually attending the special meeting and voting by virtual ballot; or
•
delivering a written notice of revocation dated after the date of the proxy being revoked by mail to the Company at iRobot Corporation,
8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Virtually attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions
described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company
or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation
in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by
your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you
may also revoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other
nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.

Abstentions",11,13
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Abstentions,"Abstentions
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either virtually or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions
will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of iRobot common stock present or represented at the special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum has been achieved.
Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Assuming a
quorum is present at the special meeting, the requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of votes
properly cast for and against those proposals. If you abstain from voting and a quorum is present at the special meeting, it will have no effect on the
compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.

The Company engaged Qatalyst Partners LP (“Qatalyst Partners”) to provide financial advice in connection with the proposed transaction (as
defined herein) based on Qatalyst Partners’ extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates and experience advising
technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. At the meeting of the iRobot board of directors on August 4, 2022,
Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 4,
2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger consideration
of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated as of August 4, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,

opinion carefully in its entirety.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the iRobot board of directors and addressed only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than
Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), to such holders. It does not address any other aspect of the merger. It does not constitute a
recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address
the price at which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time.

In considering the recommendation of the iRobot board of directors that Company stockholders vote to approve and adopt the merger
agreement, Company stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of iRobot have potential interests in the proposed
merger that may be different from or in addition to the interests of Company stockholders generally. The iRobot board of directors was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation that Company stockholders vote to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. These interests include:
•
The merger agreement provides for the cash-out of all Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards, and Company
DSU awards, with the cash payments for Company RSU awards and Company PSU awards remaining subject to the same time-vesting
and forfeiture provisions, but not performance-vesting provisions, as were applicable to such Company RSU awards and Company
PSU awards immediately prior to the effective time.
9Table of Contents
•
Certain of the Company’s executive officers may receive a cash transaction bonus under a cash transaction bonus program providing
for transaction bonuses in an aggregate amount not to exceed $12 million or a cash retention bonus under a cash retention bonus
program providing for retention bonuses in an aggregate amount not to exceed $12 million.
•
The Company’s executive officers are party to executive agreements with iRobot that provide for severance payments and accelerated
vesting of unvested equity awards in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment during the period beginning 45 days
prior to the date of the public announcement of the merger agreement and ending on the one-year anniversary of the effective time.
•
The Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under indemnification
agreements and the merger agreement.

Officers in the Merger.”",17,18

The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders (as defined under “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) in exchange for shares of iRobot common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction to such stockholders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Each such U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that
such U.S. Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of iRobot common stock surrendered in the merger.
Backup withholding taxes may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with certification
procedures under the backup withholding rules.
A stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption, “as defined under “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of iRobot common
stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States (the “U.S.”), but may be subject to backup
withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup
withholding tax.
Stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “as defined under “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Stockholders should also consult
their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular circumstances and any
consequences arising under U.S. federal estate, gift and other income and other non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S.
taxing jurisdiction.

iRobot and Amazon.com have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement (including the merger) no later than the outside date (as defined herein), including obtaining any applicable regulatory approvals
and satisfying all statutory waiting period requirements, subject to certain specified limitations under the merger agreement. These approvals include
approval under the HSR Act, clearance by the European Commission, and certain other merger filings or clearances that may be required or
advisable in other jurisdictions. Although we expect that all applicable regulatory approvals will be obtained, the merger cannot be consummated
until after expiration or termination of

If the merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, iRobot stockholders who continuously hold their shares of iRobot common stock
through the effective date of the merger, who do not vote in favor of the merger, who properly demand in writing an appraisal of their shares
delivered to the Company prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and who comply with, and do
not validly withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the applicable provisions of Delaware law will be entitled to
appraisal rights to receive, in cash, the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in connection with the merger
under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). This means that iRobot stockholders may be entitled to have their shares
of iRobot common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of iRobot
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be
paid on the amount determined to be “fair value” (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Appraisal Rights of iRobot Stockholders,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the “fair value” and the amount paid
by the surviving corporation in the merger to each iRobot stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal
proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, iRobot stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek
the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
iRobot stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement
if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of iRobot common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, iRobot stockholders must: (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal to iRobot before the vote is taken on the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement; (iii) continue to hold shares of iRobot common stock of record through the effective date of the merger; and (iv) comply with all other
procedures for exercising and perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to follow the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the
loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who otherwise would be
entitled to appraisal rights unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the iRobot stockholders who properly and timely demand
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The DGCL requirements for exercising and perfecting appraisal rights are described in further
detail in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal
rights. Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). If you hold your shares of iRobot common stock through a bank, broker or other
nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the
conditions set forth above and your written
1
1Table of Contents
demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of
your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or
other record holder of such shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what
it purports to be, and provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL
and to be set forth on the verified listed required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement

Except as permitted by the merger agreement, the Company must not, and must cause its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ directors,
officers and employees not to, and must instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, “representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an “acquisition proposal,” as defined in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation”;
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to any acquisition proposal or any inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal (other than to state the
extent to which those discussions are prohibited by the terms of the merger agreement);
•
provide any non-public information to any person in connection with any acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
•
other than as required by the directors’ fiduciary duties, waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any “standstill” or confidentiality
obligation of any person (other than any party to the merger agreement) with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries entered
into in connection with an acquisition proposal; or
•
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an acquisition proposal.
However, prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained, if iRobot receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal not solicited in
violation of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, and if the iRobot board of directors determines in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel and an outside financial advisor that (1) based on the information then available and after consultation
with its outside financial advisor, the acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a “superior proposal,” as defined
in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Receipt of Acquisition Proposals” that did not result
from a breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement and (2) the failure to take the applicable action would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, then iRobot may:
•
provide information (including non-public information) to the person making the acquisition proposal, subject to specified conditions
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement —- Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Receipt of Acquisition
Proposals”; and
12Table of Contents
•
engage in or participate in discussions and/or negotiations with that person regarding the acquisition proposal.
Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement (page 82)",20,21
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement,"Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement (page 82)
The iRobot board of directors has unanimously recommended that iRobot stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. The merger agreement permits the iRobot board of directors to effect a “change of recommendation” (as described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition
Agreement”) only in certain limited circumstances, as described below.
Before the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors may effect a change of recommendation and/or terminate the
merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, in each case if the iRobot board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that an acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a change of recommendation or terminating the
merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, (1) iRobot must have given Amazon.com at least five business days’ prior written notice of its
intention to do so, (2) iRobot must have afforded Amazon.com the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with iRobot to enable Amazon.com to
propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (3) at the end of the notice period, the iRobot board of
directors must have considered in good faith the binding written offer and any other information it deems appropriate in good faith, and must have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, that the superior proposal continues to
constitute a superior proposal if the changes proposed in the binding offer by Amazon.com were to be given effect.
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Change of Board Recommendation;
Alternative Acquisition Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement — Termination.”
In addition, before the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors may effect a change of recommendation in response
to an intervening event (as defined below) if the iRobot board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before
effecting a change of recommendation in response to an intervening event, (1) iRobot must have given Amazon.com at least five business days’
prior written notice of its intention to do so, (2) iRobot must have afforded Amazon.com the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with iRobot to
enable Amazon.com to propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (3) at the end of the notice
period, the iRobot board of directors must have considered in good faith the binding written offer and any other information it deems appropriate in
good faith, and must have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, that the failure
to effect a change of recommendation would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law if the changes proposed in the
binding offer by Amazon.com were to be given effect.
Under the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means a change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or development that (i) was
neither known by nor reasonably foreseeable by iRobot or the iRobot board of directors as of August 4, 2022 (or, if known, the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) and (ii) becomes known by the iRobot board of directors prior to the receipt of
the requisite company vote; provided, that in no event will any of the following constitute or be deemed to be an intervening event: (1) the receipt,
existence or terms of an acquisition proposal or any matter relating thereto, (2) changes in the stock price of the Company, (3) any breach by the
Company of the merger agreement or (4) the fact, in and of itself, that the Company exceeds internal or published projections (it being understood,
13Table of Contents
however, that the facts or causes underlying or contributing to any of the matters described in the preceding clauses (2) or (4) may be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event has occurred); provided, further, that an acquisition proposal that resulted from a
breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement may not be the basis for an intervening event.

Company RSU award immediately prior to the effective time;
•
outstanding Company PSU award, will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
the right to receive the PSU payment, which will be subject to the same time-vesting and forfeiture provisions, but not performance-vesting

•
outstanding Company DSU award will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and

consideration.
Q:
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
A majority of the shares entitled to vote, present virtually or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. If a quorum is
not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may, and at the request of Amazon.com, will, be adjourned or postponed from time to time by
the presiding officer (subject to the terms of the merger agreement and the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws) until a quorum is obtained.
As of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, there were 27,233,499 shares of common stock
outstanding.

Table of Contents
If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted
for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any
instruction to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the special meeting, those shares will not be entitled to
vote on any proposal at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Q:
What vote of iRobot stockholders is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement?
A:
Approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close
of business on the record date for the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from voting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in “street name” by your
broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote of iRobot stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting?
A:
Each of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and
against such proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting.
An abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have no effect on these proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).
The approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal are not conditions to the
completion of the merger.
Q:
How does the iRobot board of directors recommend that I vote?
A:
The iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that iRobot stockholders vote:
•
“FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement;
•
“FOR” the compensation proposal; and
•
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the iRobot board of directors considered in determining to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement, please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the iRobot Board of
Directors.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be
aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company
stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:
How do iRobot’s directors and officers intend to vote?
A:
We currently expect that the Company’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Table of Contents
Q:
When is the merger expected to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the merger as promptly as possible, but as of the date of this proxy statement we cannot accurately estimate the
closing date of the merger because the merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions
to Amazon.com, Merger Sub and the Company’s respective obligations to consummate the merger, some of which are not within the parties’
control. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger, and it is possible that the merger
will not be completed at all. After the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors will not have the right to terminate the
merger agreement in order to accept any alternative acquisition proposal. We expect to complete the merger promptly after the requisite company
vote is obtained and all required regulatory clearances have been received.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by the Company’s stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will
remain a public company, and shares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on
NASDAQ. In the event that either iRobot or Amazon.com terminates the merger agreement, then, in certain specified circumstances, iRobot may be
required to pay Amazon.com a termination fee in an amount equal to $56 million. Furthermore, if the merger agreement is terminated by either iRobot
or Amazon.com because the requisite company vote has not been obtained or the outside date lapses without stockholders having approved the
merger agreement, iRobot will be required to pay to Amazon.com all of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Amazon.com and Merger Sub in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions in an amount not to exceed $17 million (which amount
will be deducted from the amount of any termination fee owed or payable by the Company). See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement —
Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement.”
Q:
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?
A:
We urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you
own.
Voting Virtually
Stockholders of record will be able to vote virtually at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of
common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or
other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.
It is not necessary to virtually attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the
special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting virtually.
Attending the meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
You can also ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy via:
•
mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope;
20
Table of Contents
•
telephone, by calling the telephone number indicated on your proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the easy prompts; or
•
the Internet, by accessing the voting site indicated on the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the simple instructions.
If you had earlier consented to receiving proxy materials by email, you may simply click the “VOTE NOW” button in the accompanying
email.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a proposal, your proxy will be voted “FOR”
(1) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (2) the compensation proposal, and (3) the adjournment proposal.
We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on virtually attending the special meeting.
A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A
failure to vote or an abstention will have no effect on the other two proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank
or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not
have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, without your instructions, your shares
held in street name will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
is present at the special meeting, and will not be voted on any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of
shares held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no
instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of establishing a
quorum at the special meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with
respect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your
proxy by notifying the Company at iRobot Corporation, 8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary, or by submitting a new proxy by
telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy
being revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by virtually attending the special meeting and voting virtually; however, simply attending
the special meeting virtually will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in “street name” and you have
instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other
nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at
the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the
special meeting.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
A:
The requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of
common stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are
21
Table of Contents
voted. If you do not vote, or abstain from voting, on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other
nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your nominee may not vote your shares on the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement.
The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of votes properly cast for and against those
proposals, assuming a quorum is present. If you do not vote or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal and the
adjournment proposal (assuming that a quorum is present).
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal?
A:
The inclusion of this proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); however, the approval of this
proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. In addition, the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not
be binding on the Company or Amazon.com. If the merger agreement is approved and adopted by the Company’s stockholders and the merger is
completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their
compensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder
of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by iRobot.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common stock held in
“street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect
to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. Because of the non-routine nature of the proposals to be voted on at the special
meeting, your broker, bank or other nominee is not authorized to vote your shares on any proposal without instructions from you. You are also
invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting
unless you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, as the stockholder of record, authorizing you to vote your shares.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special
meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you
voted “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the other two proposals (assuming that a
quorum is present).
Q:
Will my shares of common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold
of record?
A:
No. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder (that is, your
custodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of
22
Table of Contents
common stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of
common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common
stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be
voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of common stock
held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted
at the special meeting, you should read carefully any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.
Q:
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
A:
If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy or voting
instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by
telephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?
A:
In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you
transfer your shares of common stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in
the merger.
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the completion of the merger. If you transfer your shares of
common stock after the record date but before the closing of the merger, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made
between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies iRobot in writing of such special
arrangements, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration. You will also lose the
ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares of common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope or grant your proxy electronically or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed
written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of
common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other
nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the merger consideration.
Do not send in your stock certificates now.
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, iRobot
stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger and otherwise comply with, and do not validly withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights
under, the applicable provisions of Delaware law will be entitled to appraisal rights to receive, in cash, the “fair value” of their shares as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to iRobot stockholders who properly deliver,
and do not properly withdraw, a written
23
Table of Contents
demand for an appraisal to iRobot prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and who comply with,
and do not otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the other procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are
summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a iRobot stockholder would be
entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. For additional information, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights of iRobot
Stockholders.” Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262).
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder
continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial
owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received
householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy
statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may
decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing the matters to be
considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of
common stock is called a “proxy card.”
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
If available, iRobot may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. iRobot intends to publish final voting results
in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that iRobot files with the SEC are publicly
available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Where can I find more information about iRobot?
A:
You can find more information about the Company from various sources described in the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”
Q:
Who can help answer my other questions?

proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree

THE SPECIAL MEETING",36,37
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,THE SPECIAL MEETING,"THE SPECIAL MEETING
We are furnishing this proxy statement to the Company’s stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the iRobot board of directors for
use at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides the Company’s stockholders with the
information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the iRobot board of directors for use at the
special meeting to be held virtually on October 17, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, via live audio webcast on the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/IRBT2022SM, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The Company will hold the special meeting virtually
via the Internet at the virtual meeting website. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person.
For information regarding attending the meeting, please see “The Special Meeting — Voting; Proxies; Revocation — Attendance.”
Purposes of the Special Meeting
At the special meeting, iRobot stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve and adopt the merger agreement;
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation proposal, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”; and
•
to approve the adjournment proposal.
Our stockholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve and adopt the merger
agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the material provisions of the
merger agreement are described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Amazon.com.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved by the Company’s stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be
paid to the Company’s executive officers even if the stockholders fail to approve the proposal.
iRobot does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and only the
matters specified in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at the special meeting.
This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about September 7, 2022, and the mailing is
expected to be completed on or about September 14, 2022.
Record Date and Quorum
The holders of record of iRobot common stock as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled
to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 27,233,499 shares of common stock were outstanding.
29Table of Contents
A majority of the shares entitled to vote, present virtually or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. Once a share is
represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set
for an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the
calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any
instruction to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the special meeting, those shares will not be entitled to vote
on any proposal at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Required Vote
Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting.
For the Company to complete the merger, iRobot stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close of
business on the record date must vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or
an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Approval of each of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast
for and against such proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting. An abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote
your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have no effect on these
proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).
Voting by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of the Company were entitled to vote approximately 398,481 shares of
common stock, or approximately 1.46% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently expect that the Company’s
directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be
considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.
Voting; Proxies; Revocation
Attendance
All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date, including stockholders of record and
beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited virtually to attend the special meeting.
To attend the special meeting virtually, you must provide proof of ownership of iRobot common stock as of the close of business on the record
date. If you hold your shares in “street name,” and you also wish to be able to vote virtually at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in
your favor, from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Voting Virtually
If you plan to virtually attend the special meeting and wish to vote virtually, you will be given a virtual ballot at the special meeting. If you are not a
stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are encouraged to
vote by proxy even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting. If you virtually attend the special meeting and vote by virtual ballot, your vote will
revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by
proxy, even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting
instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed
proxy card. Your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy
card, as described below.
Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special meeting,
your shares of common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn from time to time the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you virtually attend the special
meeting and vote virtually, the effect will be that your shares of common stock will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will not affect the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,” your broker, bank or other nominee will
send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to
provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.
In accordance with the rules of NASDAQ, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in “street name” for their
customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the
compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or
other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions with respect to these proposals from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote
such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you virtually attend the special meeting with a properly executed legal proxy from your
broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of iRobot common
stock not being deemed present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and not being voted on any of the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, if a beneficial owner of shares
held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but
31
Table of Contents
gives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum at the special meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be
voted with respect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your
shares.
Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:
•
submitting a new proxy dated after the date of the proxy being revoked, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures
described above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company, in each case, in accordance with
the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
virtually attending the special meeting and voting by virtual ballot; or
•
delivering a written notice of revocation dated after the date of the proxy being revoked by mail to the Company at iRobot Corporation, 8
Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Virtually attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described
above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a
written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it
to be received by the Company before the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your
broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also
revoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in
order to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.
Abstentions
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either virtually or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions will be
included in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock present or represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum has been achieved.
Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Assuming a
quorum is present at the special meeting, the requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of votes
properly cast for and against those proposals. If you abstain from voting and a quorum is present at the special meeting, it will have no effect on the
compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.",37,40

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted by the Company’s stockholders and the other
conditions to the closing of the merger are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the effective time (other than (1) shares owned by Amazon.com, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com
and shares owned by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (2) shares
owned by stockholders of the Company who have complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL prior to the effective time) will be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $61.00 per share in cash, without interest. Amazon.com, iRobot, Merger Sub, the surviving
corporation and the paying agent for the merger consideration will each be entitled to deduct and withhold any amounts due under applicable tax laws
from the amounts that would otherwise be payable under the terms of the merger agreement.
The Company’s common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “IRBT.” As a result of
the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be indirectly wholly owned by Amazon.com. Following the completion of the
merger, the Company common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer be
required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to its common stock in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of iRobot’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the iRobot board of directors and management
of iRobot (“iRobot management” or “Company management”) periodically review, consider and assess iRobot’s operations and financial performance, as
well as overall industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans, with the goal of enhancing
shareholder value. This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations,
acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.
During the first and second quarters of 2022, the iRobot board of directors and iRobot management actively assessed rapidly evolving industry,
global and regional macroeconomic trends and geopolitical dynamics, intensifying competitive conditions and inflationary price pressures relevant to
iRobot’s business, performance and long-term prospects.
Amazon.com had previously approached iRobot in November 2016 to propose an acquisition of iRobot at $60.50 per share. In response, iRobot had
engaged an outside financial advisor to help the iRobot board of directors in its consideration of that offer. The iRobot board of directors’ work with its
financial advisor at the time, combined with other relevant factors considered by the iRobot board of directors, resulted in iRobot informing Amazon.com
that its offer undervalued iRobot. In the subsequent months, iRobot’s trading price increased materially, and Amazon.com discontinued its engagement
with respect to a potential acquisition of iRobot. Since that time, iRobot management continued to engage approximately once per year with Amazon.com
representatives on matters unrelated to a potential mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) transaction.
As part of iRobot’s ordinary course business planning, at the direction of the iRobot board of directors, members of iRobot management in
November and December 2021 had prepared a long-term business and strategy plan through fiscal year 2024 (the “December 2021 business plan”), which
was presented to the iRobot board of directors. A portion of the December 2021 business plan was shared with investors on December 9, 2021 during
iRobot’s investor day.
On May 16, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com called Mr. Colin Angle, Chief Executive Officer of iRobot. On the call, Amazon.com expressed
interest in a potential transaction to acquire iRobot (such potential transaction involving iRobot and Amazon.com, the “proposed transaction”) and
indicated that Amazon.com could move expeditiously in its due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documentation for the proposed transaction.
On the call, Mr. Angle did not indicate whether iRobot was interested in the proposed transaction and made no commitment as to any next steps,
including whether to permit Amazon.com to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and gain access to confidential due diligence information regarding
iRobot. Following the call, Mr. Angle gave an update regarding the call to certain members of the iRobot board of directors.
On May 23, 2022, with the permission of the members of the iRobot board of directors with whom Mr. Angle spoke, iRobot entered into a
supplement to its existing non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.com. This supplement contained customary “standstill” provisions binding on
Amazon.com, and provided that such standstill provisions would automatically terminate in the event that certain change of control events relating to
iRobot occurred.
35Table of Contents
On May 25, 2022, members of iRobot management met with members of Amazon.com management to discuss high-level due diligence matters in
connection with the proposed transaction. On the call, iRobot responded to questions that Amazon.com raised regarding iRobot’s publicly disclosed
first-quarter 2022 financial results and full-year 2022 guidance range. iRobot conveyed to Amazon.com that the December 2021 business plan was
produced as of December 2021 and had not been updated subsequently for changes in Company, industry and macroeconomic and geopolitical
conditions. In addition, iRobot conveyed that given those changes and as a result of iRobot’s updated view of currently anticipated second-quarter 2022
financial performance, iRobot would likely be in the low end of the full-year 2022 guidance range provided to investors on May 4, 2022.
On May 26, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management also in attendance. Representatives of
Goodwin Procter LLP, iRobot’s outside counsel (“Goodwin”), attended portions of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, iRobot had shared with members of
iRobot management certain management guidelines which, among other things, directed management not to have any discussions regarding post-closing
employment with Amazon.com until and unless approved and authorized by the iRobot board of directors or a committee thereof. At the meeting, iRobot
management presented to the iRobot board of directors a comprehensive status update regarding the proposed transaction including the recent
interactions with Amazon.com. The iRobot board of directors also discussed interviews that members of iRobot management had conducted with
representatives of five investment banks with the iRobot board of directors’ permission, including Qatalyst Partners LP (“Qatalyst Partners”), in
connection with advising iRobot with respect to a potential strategic transaction. The iRobot board of directors then discussed the formal engagement of
Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor in connection with its review of potential strategic opportunities, including the proposed transaction, noting
Qatalyst Partners’ experience opposite Amazon.com as well as Qatalyst Partners’ extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which iRobot operates
and experience advising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. On the basis of these considerations, and subject in
all respects to the iRobot board of directors’ review of a customary relationships disclosure to be produced by Qatalyst Partners (which disclosure was
produced by Qatalyst Partners on June 8, 2022 and was promptly shared with the transaction committee (as defined below) and the iRobot board of
directors), the iRobot board of directors authorized iRobot management to negotiate terms of an engagement letter for the purpose of engaging Qatalyst
Partners. Representatives of Goodwin also discussed the iRobot board of directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with the evaluation of a potential
strategic transaction involving iRobot, whether with Amazon.com or any other counterparty. The iRobot board of directors also discussed that it would
need to evaluate iRobot’s long-range plan and projections, the current value of iRobot and available strategic opportunities before determining how to
respond to Amazon.com’s outreach. Accordingly, the iRobot board of directors authorized management to develop a set of long-range plans and
projections (an “LRP”) for the period from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2027. The directors were then invited to disclose any actual or potential conflicts
of interest they may have in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. Ms. Eva Manolis disclosed a prior business relationship with Amazon.com in
addition to ownership of Amazon.com stock that is material to her personal net worth; the iRobot board of directors determined that, as such business
relationship was not recent and such business relationship and ownership of Amazon.com stock were disclosed to the iRobot board of directors, Ms.
Manolis would not be required to recuse herself with respect to the proposed transaction. Certain other directors also disclosed ownership of
Amazon.com stock that was not material to their respective personal net worth. The iRobot board of directors also discussed adopting resolutions
forming a transaction committee of the iRobot board of directors (the “transaction committee”) to consider, review and evaluate any proposals made for a
potential transaction with any counterparty as well as any alternatives to a potential strategic transaction, including, without limitation, iRobot continuing
to operate as an independent, publicly traded company. The iRobot board of directors discussed that the transaction committee was being formed for
expediency of process, and not in response to any actual or potential conflict of interest concerns in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. The iRobot
board of directors also discussed its belief that it would be beneficial and in the best interests of stockholders for Mr. Angle to participate on the
transaction committee due to, among other reasons, his transactional skill and experience and his extensive knowledge of iRobot and the industry in
which it operates. The iRobot board of directors then adopted resolutions forming the transaction committee, and
36
Table of Contents
appointed Mr. Andrew Miller, an independent director, Ms. Michelle Stacy, an independent director, and Mr. Angle to the transaction committee.
Promptly following this meeting, Mr. Miller, Ms. Stacy and Mr. Angle each answered written questions regarding their relationships, which confirmed that
each was independent and disinterested in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. At the meeting, the iRobot board of directors also determined to
revisit the composition of the transaction committee in the event that iRobot engaged with any other counterparty with respect to which any of the
incumbent members of the transaction committee were not independent or disinterested. Finally, at the meeting, the iRobot board of directors authorized
iRobot management to continue to engage in high-level due diligence with Amazon.com in relation to the proposed transaction.
On June 1, 2022, members of iRobot management again met with members of Amazon.com management to further discuss high-level due diligence
matters in relation to the proposed transaction.
On June 6, 2022, Mr. Glen Weinstein, Chief Legal Officer of iRobot, spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, and during this discussion, the
Amazon.com representative indicated that Amazon.com was leaning toward making a non-binding proposal based on the information they had received
thus far in due diligence, and that Amazon.com would be able to provide an updated view by the end of that week.
On June 8, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed strategy around its expectation that Amazon.com would make a non-binding proposal
sometime that week, including the transaction committee’s desire for Amazon.com to propose a set of terms related to regulatory matters as part of that
proposal. The transaction committee also discussed general market dynamics and the regulatory landscape in connection with the proposed transaction.
The transaction committee then discussed a plan for the timing, scope and sequencing for a potential pre-signing market check. The transaction
committee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners whether any potential acquirors other than Amazon.com would be likely to submit a
proposal to acquire iRobot that would be superior to a proposal submitted by Amazon.com from a financial point of view, as well as execution and
regulatory considerations, leak risk, competitive sensitivities and other relevant factors with respect to any such potential acquirors (including
heightened national security-related execution risk with respect to certain potential non-U.S. acquirors that could make consummation of a transaction
with such potential non-U.S. acquirors challenging). Following such discussion, and taking into account these factors and the input provided by
Qatalyst Partners, the transaction committee determined to reach out to one additional potential acquiror, rather than conduct a broader outreach. The
transaction committee also noted that the iRobot board of directors would have the ability to consider superior proposals to acquire iRobot post-signing
of any definitive agreement with Amazon.com through a customary “fiduciary out.” Participants in the meeting also expressed their belief that, among
possible bidders for iRobot, a transaction with Amazon.com would present the most compelling strategic rationale, and discussed Amazon.com’s strong
indication that it was prepared to terminate engagement with iRobot if any leak were to occur with respect to the process. The transaction committee
determined to reach out to the specific strategic counterparty (“Company A”) as part of a market check process, but in light of the expected imminency of
Amazon.com’s initial proposal, the transaction committee determined not to make this outreach until after such initial proposal from Amazon.com was
received.
On June 9, 2022, Mr. Weinstein spoke with a representative of Amazon.com. In accordance with the direction of the transaction committee, Mr.
Weinstein conveyed the transaction committee’s desire that any non-binding proposal from Amazon.com should include a set of terms related to
regulatory matters. Amazon.com also reaffirmed that satisfactory progress on due diligence was being made and that it was continuing to lean toward
making a non-binding proposal in the near term.
On June 10, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors at its May 26, 2022 meeting, iRobot entered into an engagement
letter with Qatalyst Partners formalizing the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to act as iRobot’s financial advisor to, among other things, assist iRobot in
evaluating potential strategic opportunities, including the proposed transaction.
37
Table of Contents
On June 17, 2022, Mr. Weinstein spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who indicated that a non-binding proposal for the acquisition of
iRobot would be submitted to iRobot by Amazon.com the following week.
On June 23, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who verbally communicated to Mr. Angle a non-binding proposal for
Amazon.com to acquire iRobot for $64.00 per share in cash. Mr. Angle did not respond to this proposal during the call. Later on June 23, 2022, iRobot
received a formal non-binding letter of intent from Amazon.com to acquire iRobot for $64.00 per share in cash (the “June 23 proposal”). The $64.00 per
share offer price implied a premium to iRobot’s last closing price prior to June 23, 2022 of approximately 51%. The June 23 proposal did not propose any
terms related to regulatory matters as had been requested by iRobot. The June 23 proposal stated that Amazon.com reserved the right to immediately
terminate engagement with iRobot regarding a potential transaction if any leak occurred with respect to the process, and that the proposal was not
subject to any financing condition. The June 23 proposal did not include any request for exclusivity. The June 23 proposal was promptly shared with the
iRobot board of directors.
Later on June 23, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee directed management to finalize the LRP and, subject to iRobot board of directors or transaction
committee review and approval, provide the finalized LRP to Qatalyst Partners for purposes of providing financial analyses in connection with the iRobot
board of directors’ and the transaction committee’s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including the proposed transaction. The transaction
committee also further discussed a potential pre-signing market check and determined and directed Qatalyst Partners, now that Amazon.com’s initial
proposal had been received, to reach out to Company A as part of the market check. The transaction committee then discussed with the advisors its belief
that Amazon.com’s proposal constituted at least a credible initial offer at a significant premium to iRobot’s current trading price. The transaction
committee discussed the recent trading price of iRobot’s stock and factors that may be affecting its trading price, and the execution risk and headwinds
that iRobot expected to face in executing its standalone plan moving forward.
Later on June 23, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the transaction committee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to a
representative of Company A, and the representatives of Qatalyst Partners followed up with the same representative of Company A the next day on June
24, 2022.
On June 29, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The members of iRobot management presented their current draft of the LRP for the period from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year
2027 as of June 27, 2022 (the “Company LRP”). The members of iRobot management underscored in their presentation that in the latter half of the second
quarter of fiscal year 2022, recessionary pressures had escalated in EMEA and had begun to disrupt the U.S. market more than expected, and noted their
expectation that iRobot’s actual financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, once finalized, would fall significantly below the low end
of the publicly announced guidance range for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and would cause full-year 2022 performance to fall significantly
below the low end of the publicly announced guidance range for fiscal year 2022 (collectively, the “Q2 earnings miss”). The members of iRobot
management stated that they remained cautious and uncertain about the speed and nature of market recovery and iRobot’s own performance in coming
years in light of these conditions. As a result of these operational and macroeconomic uncertainties, in connection with the preparation of the Company
LRP, iRobot management prepared certain sensitivity scenarios with respect to the Company LRP that reflected stronger and weaker Company
performance for the projected period based on the assumed pace of market recovery from recent industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In
presenting the Company LRP to the iRobot board of directors on June 29, 2022, members of iRobot management indicated that these separate scenarios
were being provided to the iRobot board of directors for informational purposes, that the iRobot board of directors was not being asked to, and would
not be asked to, approve any of these separate scenarios and that these separate scenarios remained subject to change, as management was still actively
not be asked to, approve any of these separate scenarios and that these separate scenarios remained subject to change, as management was still actively
finalizing its review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance. Following discussion, the iRobot board of directors approved
the Company LRP and directed Qatalyst Partners to use and rely on the Company LRP for purposes of providing financial analyses in connection

with the iRobot board of directors’ evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including the proposed transaction. Qatalyst Partners then reviewed
the June 23 proposal from a financial point of view in light of the Company LRP. The iRobot board of directors also asked management to update the
market recovery scenarios based on management’s finalization of its assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance and, upon
completion of any such updates, to share related financial information with Amazon.com in connection with Amazon.com’s business and financial due
diligence. Goodwin also presented a proposed set of certain non-price terms with respect to which iRobot could potentially initiate negotiations over
regulatory matters, which included (among other things) (a) a reverse termination fee, (b) an obligation to litigate on the merits in the event that a
regulatory agency were to seek to enjoin the proposed transaction, (c) a “clear skies” covenant prohibiting Amazon.com from engaging in other M&A
transactions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the obtaining of antitrust clearance for the proposed transaction and (d) an
outside date of up to 18 months (on an as-extended basis). Finally, the iRobot board of directors discussed tactical considerations relating to iRobot’s
potential response to Amazon.com’s June 23 proposal. The iRobot board of directors (a) directed Qatalyst Partners to respond to Amazon.com (i) with a
specific price counterproposal of $70.00 per share, (ii) reiterating the iRobot board of directors’ expectation that the parties agree upon a set of terms
related to regulatory matters prior to negotiating the details of definitive transaction documentation and (iii) previewing iRobot’s Q2 earnings miss and
sharing certain financial information in that regard and (b) directed Goodwin to propose the set of certain non-price terms to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), Amazon.com’s outside counsel.
Later on June 29, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to
representatives of Amazon.com and conveyed the counterproposal of $70.00 per share, and reiterated the iRobot board of directors’ expectation that the
parties agree upon a set of terms related to regulatory matters prior to negotiating the details of definitive transaction documents. The representatives of
Qatalyst Partners also previewed iRobot’s Q2 earnings miss to the representatives of Amazon.com and indicated that iRobot would likely not meet the
low end of its full-year 2022 guidance range, and shared certain financial information in that regard. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also
discussed with representatives of Amazon.com the parties’ expectations with respect to transaction timing and Amazon.com’s ability to move forward
expeditiously to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement in respect of the proposed transaction. The representatives of Amazon.com reiterated that
Amazon.com was capable of moving expeditiously to a signing of a definitive agreement, but that it had little room to move on deal price, and that the
Amazon.com representatives would require a call with representatives of iRobot to better understand the Q2 earnings miss prior to responding to the
points conveyed by the representatives of Qatalyst Partners.
On June 30, 2022, representatives of iRobot spoke with representatives of Amazon.com to discuss the Q2 earnings miss. As a result of iRobot
management’s continued review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance, on this call the representatives of iRobot presented
information with respect to actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance. On the call, the representatives of Amazon.com conveyed that the Q2
earnings miss, as well as the expectation that iRobot would likely not meet the low end of its full-year 2022 guidance, had been a surprise to them and that
they would require some time to evaluate.
Also on June 30, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with a representative of Company A, who conveyed that Company A was
evaluating a potential transaction with iRobot but had not yet gained sufficient internal support to pursue a potential transaction and would therefore be
unlikely to proceed further in discussions of a potential acquisition of iRobot.
On July 1, 2022, representatives of Amazon.com asked members of iRobot management follow-up questions related to iRobot’s financial
performance stemming from the financial information provided on June 29 and June 30, 2022, to which members of iRobot management responded.
On July 2, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Goodwin proposed to Paul Weiss and
Amazon.com’s outside regulatory counsel the set of non-price terms related to regulatory matters that was previously presented to the iRobot board of
directors at the June 29, 2022 meeting.

On July 4, 2022, representatives of Amazon.com spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, during which Amazon.com (i) reaffirmed its offer
price of $64.00 per share notwithstanding the Q2 earnings miss, predicated on the parties’ entry into and announcement of a definitive agreement either
prior to or concurrently with iRobot’s earnings announcement for the second quarter 2022, it being understood that, standing alone, the public
announcement of the Q2 earnings miss would be expected to adversely impact iRobot’s trading price, and (ii) provided Amazon.com’s counterproposal
with respect to the set of certain non-price terms previously provided by iRobot, which counterproposal included (among other things) (a) an “antitrust”
(and not explicitly a foreign investment law) reverse termination fee equal to 5% of iRobot’s equity value, (b) an obligation to litigate on the merits in the
event that a regulatory agency were to seek to enjoin the transaction, (c) a “clear skies” covenant prohibiting Amazon.com from acquiring a specific list
of companies during the pendency of a transaction and (d) an outside date of up to 24 months (on an as-extended basis) (the “July 4 proposal”). The
reaffirmed $64.00 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot’s last closing price prior to July 4, 2022 of approximately 71%.
Also on July 4, 2022, in response to the July 4 proposal, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com and during this call Mr. Angle
expressed that he was personally not supportive of Amazon.com’s $64.00 per share price proposal but could potentially support a deal price of $65.00 per
share, subject to input from the iRobot board of directors.
Later on July 4, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee and its advisors discussed the developments described above since the June 29, 2022 iRobot
board of directors meeting, including the July 4 proposal. The transaction committee also discussed its view that the set of non-price terms related to
regulatory matters proposed by Amazon.com as part of the July 4 proposal was favorable to iRobot and would be generally acceptable. The transaction
committee resolved to recommend to the iRobot board of directors that iRobot continue to engage with Amazon.com and that, subject to continued
evaluation by the iRobot board of directors in all respects, a transaction with Amazon.com entered into at a per share price of $64.00 or more, combined
with terms related to regulatory matters that are as proposed by Amazon.com or better, would be expected to constitute a transaction that is in the best
interests of iRobot and its stockholders.
Immediately following this transaction committee meeting on July 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also in attendance. The iRobot board of directors and its advisors discussed the
developments described above since the June 29, 2022 meeting of the iRobot board of directors, including the July 4 proposal. The iRobot board of
directors also discussed the transaction committee’s impression that the set of non-price terms related to regulatory matters proposed by Amazon.com as
part of the July 4 proposal was favorable to iRobot and would be generally acceptable. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then conveyed to the iRobot
board of directors that Company A had indicated that it would be unlikely to proceed further in discussions of a potential acquisition of iRobot, and that
it was accordingly Qatalyst Partners’ expectation that no proposal would be forthcoming from Company A. Following the transaction committee’s
recommendation to the iRobot board of directors of the same, the iRobot board of directors approved that iRobot continue to engage with Amazon.com
and that, subject to continued evaluation by the iRobot board of directors in all respects, a transaction with Amazon.com entered into at a per share price
of $64.00 or more, combined with terms related to regulatory matters that are as proposed by Amazon.com or better, would be expected to constitute a
transaction that is in the best interests of iRobot and its stockholders. The iRobot board of directors and its advisors then discussed with management
the specific terms of a counterproposal that iRobot would make to Amazon.com as part of such continuing negotiations, which the iRobot board of
directors determined would consist of (i) a deal price of $65.00 per share, (ii) a reverse termination fee equal to 8% of iRobot’s equity value and (iii) a more
expansive “clear skies” covenant that was not limited to a list of specific companies.
On July 5, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Goodwin reaffirmed to representatives of Paul
Weiss that iRobot’s counterproposal consisted of the three points described above.

On July 6, 2022, members of iRobot management spoke with representatives of Amazon.com. During such discussion, Amazon.com (i) raised its
offer price to $64.50 per share but characterized this price as its best and final offer, (ii) proposed a $100 million reverse termination fee, which was
equivalent to approximately 5.4% of iRobot’s equity value, and (iii) rejected iRobot’s proposed expansion of the “clear skies” covenant, reverting to the
construct of a list of specific companies (the “July 6 proposal”). The $64.50 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot’s last closing price prior to
July 6, 2022 of approximately 63%. As the terms of the July 6 proposal were more favorable to iRobot than the terms that the iRobot board of directors
found acceptable at the July 4, 2022 iRobot board of directors meeting, later on July 6, 2022, Mr. Angle had a phone conversation with a representative of
Amazon.com and conveyed iRobot’s willingness to move forward with the proposed transaction on the basis of the July 6 proposal (including as to the
$64.50 per share deal price), subject to final iRobot board of directors approval.
Later on July 6, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with other of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The members of the transaction committee discussed the July 6 proposal. Following discussion with Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin, the members of the transaction committee noted that its view that iRobot had likely obtained the most favorable package of material deal terms
that could reasonably be obtained from Amazon.com. under the circumstances. The transaction committee approved that iRobot continue to engage with
Amazon.com on the basis of the July 6 proposal, including with respect to due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement.
In accordance with this direction of the transaction committee, iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin
proceeded to conduct multiple due diligence management sessions with representatives of Amazon.com from July 6, 2022 through July 18, 2022. iRobot
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also continued to respond to Amazon.com’s documentary due diligence requests
until the parties’ entry into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022.
On July 9, 2022, Paul Weiss sent to Goodwin Amazon.com’s initial draft of a proposed merger agreement for the proposed transaction. Paul Weiss
and Goodwin continued to negotiate and revise the merger agreement until the parties’ entry into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022.
On July 13, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed key legal issues reflected in Amazon.com’s initial draft of the merger agreement
received on July 9, 2022. The transaction committee also took note that the draft merger agreement indicated that Amazon.com would seek to have
discussions with key executives of iRobot regarding post-closing employment with Amazon.com.
Also on July 13, 2022, in connection with the continued due diligence approved by the transaction committee on July 6, 2022, iRobot provided
Amazon.com with a portion of the sensitivity scenario based on the Updated Company LRP (as defined and discussed below) that had been prepared by
iRobot management in early July 2022 and that reflected stronger Company performance assuming an accelerated pace of market recovery from recent
industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility (the “accelerated market recovery scenario”), as compared to the assumptions reflected in the
Updated Company LRP.
On July 14, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com spoke with a representative of Qatalyst Partners. The call primarily covered due diligence
logistics, but the representative of Amazon.com also conveyed Amazon.com’s view that the information presented in the accelerated market recovery
scenario was below its expectations and that Amazon.com was still considering such information.
On July 18, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com in connection with Amazon.com’s due diligence of the senior executive
team at iRobot. The call did not involve any discussion about post-closing compensatory or other employment arrangements.
On July 20, 2022, Ms. Julie Zeiler, Chief Financial Officer of iRobot, exchanged emails with a representative of Amazon.com. Ms. Zeiler reported that,
as a result of iRobot management’s continued review
41
Table of Contents
and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance, iRobot was projecting an additional shortfall in revenue and non-GAAP operating
income (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger —Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”) for the second quarter 2022
relative to what was previously presented to Amazon.com.
On July 22, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Amazon.com’s financial advisor, spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express
concern about iRobot’s financial performance and previewing that Amazon.com was evaluating a potential reduction in its offer price. Representatives of
Qatalyst Partners responded on these communications that a price reduction would be received very poorly by the iRobot board of directors.
Also on July 22, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who conveyed that Amazon.com was reducing its offer price from
$64.50 to $60.00 per share (the “July 22 proposal”). The $60.00 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot’s last closing price prior to July 22, 2022 of
approximately 34%. The representative of Amazon.com also conveyed strongly that Amazon.com would not have any significant additional headroom on
the deal price.
On July 23, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed the July 22 proposal. The transaction committee further discussed with Qatalyst
Partners whether Amazon.com was genuinely prepared to terminate engagement with respect to the proposed transaction entirely or whether
Amazon.com was simply seeking added leverage in negotiations with iRobot. The transaction committee reviewed with Qatalyst Partners potential
implications of another public M&A transaction recently announced by Amazon.com, as well as iRobot’s revised second-quarter 2022 financial
performance. The transaction committee members generally opined that, while such recent developments were disappointing, the July 22 proposal would
result in a transaction that was still in the best interests of iRobot stockholders, especially in light of, among other things, iRobot’s recent financial
underperformance and the market and execution risks associated with its standalone plan. The transaction committee members cited the highly uncertain
industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes over the coming years, and the uncertainty related to the timing of any market recovery. The
transaction committee determined to present this feedback to the iRobot board of directors at the meeting immediately following the July 23 transaction
committee meeting.
On July 23, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. The iRobot board of directors discussed the July 22 proposal. The iRobot board of directors further discussed with Qatalyst
Partners whether Amazon.com was genuinely prepared to terminate engagement with respect to the proposed transaction entirely or whether
Amazon.com was simply seeking added leverage in negotiations with iRobot. The iRobot board of directors reviewed with Qatalyst Partners potential
implications of another public M&A transaction recently announced by Amazon.com, as well as iRobot’s revised second-quarter 2022 financial
performance. The transaction committee members provided their opinion that, while such recent developments were disappointing, the July 22 proposal
would result in a transaction that was still in the best interests of iRobot stockholders, especially in light of, among other things, iRobot’s recent financial
underperformance and the execution risks associated with its standalone plan. The transaction committee members cited the highly uncertain industry,
macroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes over the coming years, and the uncertainty related to the timing of any market recovery. The iRobot board of
directors generally agreed with the transaction committee’s feedback on the July 22 proposal. As a result, the iRobot board of directors authorized
management to revert to (i) Amazon.com with a counterproposal of $61.00 per share and (ii) ultimately continue engagement with Amazon.com at a deal
price of at least $60.50 per share.
Later on July 23, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com and relayed the counterproposal of $61.00 per share, and the
representative of Amazon.com conveyed that Amazon.com would agree to $61.00 per share as its best and final offer price. In accordance with the
direction of the iRobot board of
42
Table of Contents
directors, Mr. Angle expressed iRobot’s willingness to move forward at $61.00 per share as the final deal price for the proposed transaction and as a basis
for considering negotiation of the other material terms of the proposed transaction.
Over the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022, the parties finalized their
negotiation of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents pertaining to the proposed transaction, with the representatives of
Goodwin and Paul Weiss continuing to exchange drafts of such documents, and Amazon.com concluded its due diligence process.
Subsequent to the parties agreeing on valuation as a basis for moving forward, on July 25, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com requested that
Amazon.com be permitted to initiate discussions with Mr. Angle regarding Mr. Angle’s potential post-closing employment with Amazon.com and the
terms thereof. Amazon.com stated that such discussions and agreement with respect to post-closing employment terms for Mr. Angle would be a
condition to signing a definitive agreement with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin discussed this request with the
members of the transaction committee other than Mr. Angle, and following such discussion, and in light of the parties having agreed on valuation and the
non-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward, these other members unanimously authorized Mr. Angle to have such discussions with
Amazon.com, subject to Goodwin supervising such discussions on behalf of iRobot and Mr. Angle retaining his own legal counsel. Mr. Angle retained
his own legal counsel later on July 25, 2022, and over the course of the ensuing several days, Mr. Angle negotiated his post-closing compensatory
arrangements independently with Amazon.com and arrived at an agreement on such terms (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests of
the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger – New Arrangements with iRobot Executive Officers”). Prior to these developments and
negotiations commencing on July 25, 2022, under no circumstance did Mr. Angle discuss his potential post-closing employment with Amazon.com or the
terms thereof with any representatives of Amazon.com.
On July 26, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with representatives of Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee
discussed general status updates relating to the proposed transaction. Immediately after this transaction committee meeting, Mr. Miller and Ms. Stacy
held an executive session with representatives of Goodwin and discussed matters relating to Mr. Angle’s post-closing employment with Amazon.com.
On July 28, 2022, members of iRobot management spoke with representatives of Amazon.com to discuss communications planning related to the
proposed transaction. The parties agreed to target the public announcement of the proposed transaction on August 5, 2022, assuming that a definitive
agreement was entered into on or prior to such date.
On July 31, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goodwin again informed the iRobot board of directors about the history of Amazon.com’s discussions
and eventual agreement with Mr. Angle regarding his post-closing compensatory arrangements. Representatives of Goodwin then presented the
proposed final material legal terms in the definitive agreement and ancillary documents to be entered into with Amazon.com and reviewed with the
directors their fiduciary duties. Members of iRobot management then presented an update to the Company LRP (the “Updated Company LRP”) and the
related sensitivity scenarios to the iRobot board of directors, which Updated Company LRP and related sensitivity scenarios had been updated following
the closing of iRobot’s second fiscal quarter as a result of iRobot management’s continued review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial
performance, based on additional information that first became available to iRobot management following the closing of the second quarter, and which
update was explained to the iRobot board of directors. The Updated Company LRP principally reflected changes to iRobot’s projected performance for
the second half of fiscal year 2022, and for fiscal years 2023 to 2027, iRobot’s projected revenue, non-GAAP gross profit (as defined in the section entitled
“The Merger — Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”) and non-GAAP operating income remained unchanged, except
43
Table of Contents
that iRobot’s projected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and unlevered free cash flow were modified
slightly to reflect the most recent and updated view of iRobot management with respect to iRobot’s long-term working capital and capital spend.
Members of iRobot management reiterated that, other than the Updated Company LRP, the updated sensitivity scenarios were being provided to the
iRobot board of directors for informational purposes, that the iRobot board of directors was not being asked to, and would not be asked to, approve any
of these separate sensitivity scenarios. Following discussion by the iRobot board of directors, including regarding the execution risks associated with
iRobot’s standalone plan and the uncertainty associated with the timing of the market recovery, the iRobot board of directors directed that Qatalyst
Partners use and rely on the Updated Company LRP for purposes of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses in rendering its opinion with respect to the
proposed transaction.
On August 4, 2022, the parties finalized the negotiation and drafting of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents
pertaining to the proposed transaction as well as Amazon.com’s due diligence process, and the transaction committee held a meeting to review the final
terms of the proposed definitive agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com and related ancillary documents and to vote on whether to recommend
entry into such definitive agreement to the iRobot board of directors. Members of iRobot management and representatives of Goodwin and Qatalyst
Partners also attended the meeting. The transaction committee discussed its reasons in favor of recommending the proposed transaction to the iRobot
board of directors, as well as considerations of risk pertaining to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then reviewed with the
transaction committee a summary form of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses with respect to the proposed transaction on the basis of the $61.00 deal
price and the Updated Company LRP, and noted that a more detailed summary would be provided to the full iRobot board of directors at the upcoming
iRobot board of directors meeting, and stated that Qatalyst Partners would be prepared to deliver its fairness opinion (on the basis of the $61.00 deal price
and the Updated Company LRP) at such upcoming iRobot board of directors meeting. Representatives of Goodwin then reviewed with the transaction
committee the employment discussions and agreement between Mr. Angle and Amazon.com, as well as the ownership of Amazon.com stock by certain
members of the iRobot board of directors, as had previously been previewed with the iRobot board of directors. The transaction committee then adopted
resolutions favorably recommending the proposed transaction with Amazon.com to the iRobot board of directors, except that Mr. Angle voluntarily
recused himself from this vote in light of his employment discussions with Amazon.com, in order to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest of the
transaction committee.
Immediately following this transaction committee meeting on August 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors met to review the final terms of the
proposed definitive agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com and related ancillary documents and to vote on whether to approve entry into the
proposed definitive agreement with Amazon.com. Members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also attended
the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the iRobot board of directors its financial analyses with respect to the proposed
transaction on the basis of the $61.00 deal price and the Updated Company LRP. Representatives of Goodwin then reminded the iRobot board of directors
of the employment discussions and agreement between Mr. Angle and Amazon.com, as well as certain ownership of Amazon.com stock by certain
members of the iRobot board of directors, as had previously been previewed with the iRobot board of directors. The iRobot board of directors (other than
Mr. Angle) unanimously approved participation by Mr. Angle and such other members of the iRobot board of directors in their discussions regarding,
and their voting upon, the proposed transaction. Members of the transaction committee then presented the formal recommendation of the transaction
committee with respect to the proposed transaction, including that it was the transaction committee’s determination to favorably recommend that the
iRobot board of directors approve the proposed transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the iRobot board of directors its
financial analyses of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon. At the conclusion of its
presentation, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of
August 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger
consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received
44
Table of Contents
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or
any affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP”. After extensive discussions of the
proposed transaction with Amazon.com and the matters summarized for the iRobot board of directors at the meeting, the iRobot board of directors then
unanimously (i) determined that it was in the best interests of iRobot and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement
with Amazon.com, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement with Amazon.com and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) recommended that iRobot stockholders adopt the merger agreement with Amazon.com and directed that such
matter be submitted for consideration of iRobot stockholders at a special meeting of iRobot stockholders.
Later in the evening on August 4, 2022, iRobot and Amazon.com executed and delivered the merger agreement.
Early in the morning on August 5, 2022, the parties issued a press release publicly announcing the proposed transaction.

The iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that iRobot stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement
with Amazon.com at the special meeting.
The iRobot board of directors, with the assistance of its independent financial and legal advisors, evaluated the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, unanimously determined that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders, unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement and authorized the Company to enter into the merger agreement. Accordingly, on August 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors
unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of iRobot approve and adopt the merger agreement.
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the iRobot board of directors met six times between May 26, 2022 and August 4, 2022, including, as
needed, with iRobot’s independent legal and financial advisors, and considered the following material factors relating to the merger agreement and the
merger, each of which the iRobot board of directors believes supported its decision:
•
the fact that the $61.00 per share cash price provides stockholders with attractive value and liquidity and relative certainty for their shares of
Company common stock;
•
the current and historical market prices of Company common stock, including the market performance of the common stock in light of
current industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, and the fact that the $61.00 per share cash price represents a premium of 48% to the
30-day volume weighted average closing price as of August 4, 2022, and strong transaction multiple of 18.5x iRobot’s estimated EBITDA for
CY2023E based on the Updated Company LRP described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Certain iRobot
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information;”
•
the belief that entering into the merger agreement with Amazon.com would be more favorable to Company stockholders on a risk-adjusted,
time-adjusted basis than the other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including:
•
the continued operation of the Company on a standalone basis and the pursuit of other potential actionable strategic or financial
transactions, in light of the iRobot board of directors’ assessment of the Company’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive
position and historical and projected financial performance (as adjusted for the Company’s actual performance in the second quarter
2022). To this end, the iRobot board of directors considered, among other things:
45Table of Contents
•
the nature of iRobot’s industry, including aggressive competition from current overseas and domestic industry participants;
•
the categories in which iRobot operates, the potentially growing and intensifying challenges faced by the Company and the
attendant risks attributable to continuing as an independent public company;
•
the potential recessionary pressures in the U.S. and EMEA and the Company’s cautiousness about the pace of the market
recovery and the Company’s own performance; and
•
the potential rewards of the Company’s standalone long-term plan, analyzing the value enhancement that could be achieved
if the risks described above were to be overcome, but also recognizing that substantial investments, expenditures and
assumptions of risk would be required in connection with the long-term plan.
•
possible strategic transactions with third parties other than Amazon.com, taking into account the financial capacity, risk of leaks,
regulatory considerations and other execution risks associated with potential alternative bidders and the evaluation provided by the
Company’s financial advisor;
•
the iRobot board of directors’ belief that the stated positions of Amazon.com that the $61.00 per share merger consideration was the
maximum amount that Amazon.com would offer to pay to acquire the Company, including by factoring in Amazon.com’s reasons for
reducing its prior proposal of $64.50 per share, and that Amazon.com would disengage from its efforts to acquire the Company if the
$61.00 per share price were not accepted.
•
the iRobot board of directors’ assessment of the terms of the merger agreement relating to the Company’s ability to respond to unsolicited
acquisition proposals, including:
•
the Company’s right to provide non-public information in response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain unsolicited acquisition
proposals made before Company stockholder approval of the transaction is obtained; and
•
the Company’s ability to terminate the merger agreement prior to obtaining Company stockholder approval of the transaction in
specified circumstances relating to a superior proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee which the iRobot board of directors
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and not an impediment to a competing transaction. For more information, please
see the section of this proxy captioned “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Change of Board
Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement.”

the iRobot board of directors’ assessment of additional terms of the merger agreement, including:
•
the fact that, in the event the merger agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of the merger in certain circumstances relating
to the failure of antitrust clearances to be obtained, Amazon.com will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $94,000,000,
subject to and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;
•
iRobot’s right to specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement;
•
the fact that the consummation of the merger is subject to the approval of Company stockholders, who will have the opportunity to
adopt or reject the merger agreement;
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Company stockholders who continuously hold their shares of
Company common stock through the effective date of the merger, who do not vote in favor of the merger, who properly demand in
writing an appraisal of their shares delivered to the Company prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and who comply with, and do not validly withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under,
Section 262 of the DGCL, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to seek an appraisal by the Delaware Court
of Chancery of the “fair value” of their shares of Company common stock (exclusive of any elements of value
46
Table of Contents
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be
fair value), which may be determined by the court to be more than, less than, or the same as the merger consideration;
•
the initial outside date of August 4, 2023 with two six-month automatic extensions in certain circumstances as set forth in the merger
agreement in the event that antitrust clearances have not been received as of such date, allowing for time that the iRobot board of
directors believed to be sufficient to complete the merger;
•
the fact that, taken as a whole, the comprehensive terms of the merger agreement, including the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and termination rights and fees of the parties, as finally negotiated are reasonable and customary; and
•
the fact that the iRobot board of directors and iRobot management, in coordination with iRobot’s independent legal and financial
advisors, negotiated with Amazon.com on an arms-length basis, including with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the
merger agreement.
•
the fact that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, thereby providing Company stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity
for their shares, especially when viewed against the above-noted risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s business and current
and foreseeable industry, market and macroeconomic conditions;
•
the iRobot board of directors’ assessment that the likelihood of completion of the transaction and the protections provided by the merger
agreement in the event of regulatory challenges to the transaction are significant factors in support of the transaction, in light of, among
other things:
•
the complementary nature of the businesses of the Company and Amazon.com;
•
the obligations of Amazon.com and the Company under the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts to defend against and
eliminate all regulatory challenges to the transaction, including Amazon.com’s duty to litigate against government authorities or any
other person under antitrust laws and the obligation of Amazon.com to refrain from certain acquisition activity that would reasonably
be expected to exacerbate such challenges, in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order by a governmental
authority that would prevent the closing prior to the outside date;
•
Amazon.com’s obligation to pay a reverse termination fee in specified circumstances relating to termination of the merger agreement
on account of antitrust challenges;
•
the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement and the fact that Amazon.com has a substantial amount of cash on its
balance sheet;
•
the business reputation and capabilities of Amazon.com, including Amazon.com’s track record of successfully completing merger and
acquisition transactions and the iRobot board of directors’ belief that Amazon.com was highly likely to complete the proposed
transaction; and
•
the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the iRobot board of directors believes are reasonable and
customary, and which, in the case of the conditions related to the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties, are
generally qualified by a traditional public company “material adverse effect” standard.
•
Receipt of Fairness Opinion and Presentation from Qatalyst Partners. The iRobot board of directors considered the oral opinion of
Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of
Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger
agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. See “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.”

Table of Contents
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the iRobot board of directors also considered the risks and potentially negative factors relating to
the merger agreement and the merger, including:
•
the fact that Company stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company following the merger, and therefore will cease
to participate in the future earnings of growth that the Company may achieve, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the
Company’s common stock as a result of the merger;
•
the fact that the transaction has a potential outside date as late as two years from the signing date, that stockholders could be asked to vote
on approval and adoption of the merger agreement well in advance of the completion of the transaction and that there is no interest payable
on the merger consideration or adjustment for inflation, and the purchase price is fixed regardless of any macroeconomic and/or tech sector
recovery during the pendency of the transaction;
•
the fact that, in light of the iRobot board of directors’ determinations as to other strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company,
the Company performed a “market check” prior to entry into the merger agreement with Amazon.com, which involved outreach to a strategic
party which did not result in any expression of interest, and that the merger agreement does not provide the Company with an opportunity
to actively solicit alternative bids after entry into the merger agreement in accordance with a “go-shop” mechanism;
•
the possibility that the merger is not completed as a result of failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or the institution of regulatory
injunctions in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, or other reasons;
•
the fact that the reverse termination fee may be inadequate to compensate the Company for the damage caused by a termination of the
merger agreement and that, if available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce and the success of which may
be uncertain;
•
the risk and costs of stockholder or third-party litigation relating to the merger;
•
the risks and costs to the Company if the merger is not completed;
•
the potential uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of completion of the merger, including on the Company’s stockholders,
employees, potential and existing customers and suppliers and other parties, and the risk that such uncertainty may impair the Company’s
ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties to seek to change or not enter into business relationships
with the Company;
•
the risk of management distraction as a result of the merger;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business before completion of the merger, generally requiring the Company to use
reasonable best efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting the Company from taking specified actions, which
may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities, anticipated or not, that may arise;
•
the possibility that the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $56 million under certain circumstances or, if the merger
agreement is terminated by either the Company or Amazon.com because Company stockholders do not approve the merger agreement or
the outside date lapses without stockholders having approved the merger agreement, to pay expenses incurred by Amazon.com and Merger
Sub in an amount not to exceed $17 million (which amount would be deducted from the amount of any termination fee owed or payable by
the Company);
•
the fact that the receipt of cash by Company stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock will generally be a taxable
transaction to Company stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
•
other risks and uncertainties of the nature identified in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” and in
iRobot’s filings with the SEC, including the risks set forth in

Table of Contents
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” in iRobot’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2022 and iRobot’s Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 2, 2022 and July 2, 2022. For more information, see section of this proxy statement captioned
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the iRobot board of directors concluded that the risks, uncertainties,
restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby were outweighed by the
positive factors and potential benefits associated with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that supported its determination
and recommendation. Accordingly, the iRobot board of directors determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are
advisable and in the best interests of, iRobot and its stockholders.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the iRobot board of directors includes the material factors considered by
the iRobot board of directors but does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the iRobot board of directors. The members of the iRobot
board of directors evaluated the various factors listed above, among other things, in light of their knowledge of the business, financial condition and
prospects of iRobot and considered the advice of iRobot’s independent financial and legal advisors. In view of the complexity and variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the iRobot board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did
not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in
considering the information and reasons described above, individual members of the iRobot board of directors each applied his or her own personal
business judgment to the process and may have given different weights to different factors. The iRobot board of directors did not undertake to make any
specific determinations as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determinations. The
iRobot board of directors unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of iRobot approve the merger and the merger agreement based
upon the totality of information it considered.
When considering the foregoing recommendation of the iRobot board of directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, stockholders should be aware that some of iRobot’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of stockholders more generally. The iRobot board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other
matters, to the extent that they existed at the time, in reaching the determination that the merger agreement and the transactions were advisable and in the
best interests of iRobot and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the
merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions, in making its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the transactions and in directing that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “— Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”
The explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”
Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information",53,57

iRobot does not, in the ordinary course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the public other than generally providing,
on a quarterly basis, estimated ranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current or pending fiscal year in its regular
earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with evaluating a potential strategic transaction in June 2022, iRobot
management created the Company LRP, referred to in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Background of the Merger” (the “background
section”). As a result of various operational and macroeconomic
49Table of Contents
uncertainties as more fully described in the background section, in connection with the preparation of the Company LRP, iRobot management prepared
certain sensitivity scenarios with respect to the Company LRP that reflected stronger and weaker Company performance for the projected period based on
the assumed pace of market recovery from recent industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In presenting the Company LRP to the iRobot board
of directors in June 2022, members of iRobot management noted that the Company LRP and related sensitivity scenarios remained subject to change,
since, at the time of such presentation, management was still actively finalizing its review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial
performance.
As more fully described in the background section, following the closing of iRobot’s second fiscal quarter, iRobot management presented the
Updated Company LRP to reflect its assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance based on additional information that first became
available to iRobot management following the closing of the second quarter. The Updated Company LRP principally reflected changes to iRobot’s
projected performance for second half of fiscal year 2022, and for fiscal years 2023 to 2027 iRobot’s projected revenue, non-GAAP gross profit and non-
GAAP operating income remained unchanged except iRobot’s projected adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow were modified slightly to reflect
the most recent and updated view of iRobot management with respect to long term working capital and capital spend.
A portion of the sensitivity scenario based on the Updated Company LRP that reflected stronger Company performance assuming an accelerated
market recovery scenario, as compared to the assumptions reflected in the Updated Company LRP, was provided to Amazon.com in response to its
request during the due diligence process for certain forward-looking financial information related to an illustrative consumer market recovery scenario.
As more fully described in the background section, the iRobot board of directors directed Qatalyst Partners to use and rely on the Updated
Company LRP for purposes of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses and fairness opinion as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP”.
The Company LRP, the Updated Company LRP and the accelerated market recovery scenario are collectively referred to herein as the “prospective
financial information”.
The prospective financial information reflects estimates and assumptions made by iRobot management with respect to general business, economic,
competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond iRobot’s control. In particular, the prospective financial information, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily was based on
numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Because the prospective financial information covers multiple years, it becomes
subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and is unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance that could have an effect on iRobot’s
business and its results of operations. The prospective financial information was developed solely using the information available to iRobot management
at the time it was created and reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The prospective financial information
further reflects subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual
results and business developments. Important factors that may affect actual results or that may result in the prospective financial information not being
achieved include, but are not limited to, iRobot’s pending acquisition by Amazon.com, expectations regarding the timing of the merger, new product sales,
product development and offerings, ability to address consumer needs, the expansion of iRobot’s addressable market, factors for differentiation of
iRobot’s products, product integration plans, iRobot’s consumer robots, iRobot’s competition, iRobot’s strategy, iRobot’s market position, market
acceptance of iRobot’s products, seasonal factors, revenue recognition, iRobot’s profits, growth of iRobot’s revenues, composition of iRobot’s revenues,
iRobot’s cost of revenues, units shipped, average selling prices, the impact of promotional activity and tariffs, the ability to recover tariff refund claims,
operating expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and compensation costs,
iRobot’s projected income tax rate, iRobot’s credit and letter of credit facilities, efforts to mitigate supply chain challenges, availability of
50
Table of Contents
semiconductor chips, liquidity and the impact of cost-control measures and the amount of restructuring charges related to such activities, and other
factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and the risk
factors described in iRobot’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and
Current Reports on Form 8-K. The prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation
or presentation of prospective financial information. The prospective financial information cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future
operating results and should not be relied upon as such.
None of iRobot, the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners, Amazon.com or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives
makes any representation or warranty to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the prospective financial
information or the ultimate performance of iRobot relative to the prospective financial information. The inclusion of the summary of the prospective
financial information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation or warranty of iRobot, the iRobot board of directors,
Qatalyst Partners, Amazon.com or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives that the prospective financial information or the
information contained therein are material. The inclusion of the summary of the prospective financial information in this proxy statement should not be
regarded as an indication that iRobot or anyone who receives the prospective financial information then considered, or now considers, the prospective
financial information to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In the view of iRobot
management, the prospective financial information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of
iRobot management at the time and presented, to the best of iRobot management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and iRobot’s
expected future financial performance as of the date such information was prepared. Except as required by applicable law, neither iRobot, the iRobot board
of directors, Qatalyst Partners, Amazon.com, nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives intends to, and each of them disclaims
any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the prospective financial information if any or all of it has changed or changes. Since the
prospective financial information was created, iRobot has made publicly available its actual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2022.
You should review iRobot’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2022 for this information.
In light of the foregoing, and the uncertainties inherent in the prospective financial information, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if
any, reliance on the prospective financial information. The prospective financial information should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the
historical financial statements and other information regarding iRobot in its public filings with the SEC. The prospective financial information does not
take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the prospective financial information was prepared. The
prospective financial information was developed by iRobot management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and therefore the prospective financial information does not give effect to the proposed merger or
any changes to iRobot’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger, including any costs incurred in
connection with the proposed merger. Furthermore, the prospective financial information does not take into account the effect of any failure of the
proposed merger to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income and unlevered free cash flow (each as defined below) contained in the summary of the
prospective financial information set forth below are each “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance or operating measures that
are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed
as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be calculated differently than similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures published by other
companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be
included in a
51
Table of Contents
GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as alternatives to, financial measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the prospective financial information were relied on by Qatalyst Partners
for the purposes of its fairness opinion and by the iRobot board of directors in connection with its consideration of a potential strategic transaction. The
SEC rules, which otherwise would require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, do
not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in connection with a proposed business combination
transaction, such as the merger, if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of the non-GAAP
financial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the iRobot board of directors or
Qatalyst Partners in connection with the merger. Accordingly, iRobot has not provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in
the prospective financial information to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The information and tables set forth below are included solely to give iRobot stockholders access to certain of the financial and operating financial
information that were made available, as applicable, to the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners and Amazon.com, and are not included in this
proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder’s decision to vote with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement or for any other purpose.
The prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, iRobot management.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying
prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to iRobot’s previously issued financial statements. It
does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,"Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP
The Company retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the iRobot board of directors in connection with the proposed transaction
and to evaluate whether the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
53Table of Contents
terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst
Partners’ extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates and experience advising technology companies in connection
with potential strategic transactions. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the
meeting of the iRobot board of directors on August 4, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other
matters set forth therein, the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or
any affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following the meeting, Qatalyst Partners delivered its written
opinion, dated August 4, 2022, to the iRobot board of directors.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated as of August 4, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated
into this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its
entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the iRobot board of directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or
any affiliate of Amazon.com), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the merger or any other
matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst
Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B.
For purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft, dated as of August 3, 2022, of the merger agreement (the “draft merger agreement”),
certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst
Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including the Updated
Company LRP, described more fully in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”
Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior
management of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company common stock and compared
the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-
traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered
such other factors as it deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to
the Updated Company LRP, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Company management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Updated Company LRP
had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Company management of the future financial
performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to such Updated Company LRP or the
assumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement would not differ materially from the final
executed merger agreement and that the merger would be consummated in accordance
54
Table of Contents
with the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay of any terms or conditions. In addition, Qatalyst Partners
assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions
would be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed transaction.
Qatalyst Partners relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to
legal, tax or regulatory matters. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners
relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products
of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners’ opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions
used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners’ opinion
did not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with,
the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), and
Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or
employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.
The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated August 4, 2022. The
analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all
analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses,
Qatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts’ projections of the future financial performance of the Company as of
August 3, 2022 (the “analyst projections”) and the Updated Company LRP described more fully in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) —
Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must
be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’
financial analyses.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential, present values of a share
of Company common stock as of July 2, 2022 (which was the end of the Company’s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet
date) by:
•
adding:
(a)
the implied net present value of the Company’s corresponding estimated future unlevered free cash flows, based on the Updated
Company LRP, for the third quarter of calendar year 2022 through calendar year 2026 (which implied present value was calculated by
using a range of discount rates of 11.5% to 15.5%, based on the Company’s estimated weighted average cost of capital;
55
Table of Contents
(b)
the implied net present value of the Company’s terminal value, calculated by multiplying its estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar
year 2027 based on the Updated Company LRP by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated EBITDA
of 6.0x to 12.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment), and discounted to present value using the
same range of discount rates used in item (a) above; and
(c)
the Company’s cash and cash equivalents of $63,000,000 as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management; and
•
subtracting the $35,000,000 principal amount of the Company’s outstanding debt as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management;
and
•
dividing the resulting amount by: the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock
method), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, each
outstanding as of the close of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, with each of the
above-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated
dilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and
cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Company management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Company common stock of approximately $49.84 to
$94.59.

Based upon the analyst projections for calendar year 2023, and using the closing prices as of August 3, 2022 for shares of the selected companies,
Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus revenue for calendar year
2023 (the “CY2023E Revenue Multiples”) and the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus EBITDA for calendar year
2023 (the “CY2023E EBITDA Multiples”) for each of the selected companies. For purposes of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners calculated the Company’s
enterprise value assuming the Company’s net cash as of July 2, 2022, which was approximately $28,000,000, as provided by Company’s management.
Estimated Revenue Multiples
Based upon the analyst projections and the Company’s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue
Multiple for the Company of 0.79x.
Based on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of
0.60x to 0.85x and applied this range to the Company’s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue of $1.595 billion based on the Updated Company LRP.
Based on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock
method), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the
close of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for
Company common stock of approximately $34.29 to $48.13 based on the Updated Company LRP.
Estimated EBITDA Multiples
Based upon the analyst projections and the Company’s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E EBITDA
Multiple for the Company of 12.4x.
Based on an analysis of the CY2023E EBITDA Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of
7.0x to 13.0x and applied this range to the Company’s estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA of $94,000,000 based on the Updated Company LRP.
Based on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock
method), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the
close of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for
Company common stock of approximately $23.78 to $43.29 based on the Updated Company LRP.
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many
of these matters are beyond the Company’s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company’s business and the industry in general, industry
growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in
general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using selected company data.

Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the merger by the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial
analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may
have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less
probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.
Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), to such
holders. This analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which Company common stock might actually trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the iRobot board of directors was one of many factors considered by the iRobot board of
directors in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest
thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock
(other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), or of whether the iRobot board of directors would have been willing to agree to different
consideration. The merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, payable in the merger was
determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Amazon.com and was unanimously approved by the iRobot board of directors.
Qatalyst Partners provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration
to the Company or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from
which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Amazon.com or certain of their respective
affiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of
its affiliates and the Company or Amazon.com pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners
and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Amazon.com and their respective
affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provided financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed transaction for which it will be paid
approximately $31 million, $4 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and
the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the consummation of the merger. The Company has
58
Table of Contents
also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst
Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners
or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of
Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

In considering the recommendations of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger, Company stockholders should be aware that the
directors and executive officers of iRobot have certain interests, including financial interests, in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of Company stockholders generally. The iRobot board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters,
in adopting the merger agreement, and in making its recommendation that Company stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. See the
section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Background of the Merger” and the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the iRobot Board of Directors.” These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative
and the table below.
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
Stock Options. At the effective time, each outstanding Company option, whether vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and be converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 30
days) following the effective time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to the Company
option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the merger consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of
such Company option. Any Company option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration will be cancelled
at the effective time for no consideration or payment.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company RSU award, will, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the RSU payment. The RSU payment will be subject to the same time-based vesting
and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU award immediately prior to the effective time.
Performance Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company PSU award, will, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the PSU payment. The PSU payment will be subject to the same time-vesting and
forfeiture provisions, but not performance-vesting provisions, as were applicable to such Company PSU award immediately prior to the effective time.
Deferred Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company DSU award will, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 30 calendar days)
following the effective time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company DSU award
multiplied by (ii) the merger consideration.
Treatment of ESPP. The merger agreement provides that the offering period under the ESPP in effect on the date of the merger agreement will end on
the earlier of (x) the next scheduled purchase date, which is November 14, 2022, or (y) no later than the business day preceding the closing date, and no
additional offering periods will commence thereafter.
Quantification of Payments for Executive Officers. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of the Company’s named
executive officers on settlement of their unvested Company equity awards, see
59Table of Contents
“— Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers” below. The estimated aggregate amount that would be
payable to iRobot’s two executive officers who are not named executive officers in settlement of their unvested equity-based awards if the effective time
occurred on July 31, 2022 is $4,303,245. Vested Company Options are included in the table under “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management” below.
Quantification of Payments for Non-Employee Directors. As of July 31, 2022, each non-employee director held 4,937 unvested restricted stock
units other than Ms. Golz, who held 6,285 unvested restricted stock units. All such restricted stock units held by non-employee directors will accelerate
and fully vest on the closing date. As a result, we estimate that the aggregate amount that would be payable to the Company’s seven non-employee
directors for their unvested Company equity-based awards if the effective time occurred on July 31, 2022 is $2,190,327. In addition, Mr. Ali held
approximately 6,314.19 Company DSU Awards under our Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Compensation Program as of July 31, 2022, with an estimated
value of $385,166. As of July 31, 2022, none of our non-employee directors held any Company options.
Transaction Bonus Program and Retention Bonus Program
Pursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot may establish a cash transaction bonus program providing for transaction bonuses in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $12 million (the “Transaction Bonus Program”). Awards under the Transaction Bonus Program vest and become payable as follows:
(i) 25% on the six-month anniversary of the date of the merger agreement, (ii) 25% on the closing of the merger and (iii) 50% on the three-month
anniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to the employee’s continued employment through the applicable payment date; provided, however, if an
employee’s employment is terminated by iRobot without cause on or after the closing of the merger and prior to the date that the full amount of the bonus
payable to such employee under the Transaction Bonus Program has been paid, the unpaid portion of the bonus shall, subject to the employee’s
execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, become payable to such employee.
In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot may establish a cash retention bonus program providing for retention bonuses in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $12 million (the “Retention Bonus Program”). Awards under the Retention Bonus Program will vest and become payable
on the six-month anniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to the employee’s continued employment through such date; provided, however, if an
employee’s employment is terminated by iRobot without cause on or after the closing of the merger and prior to the date that the bonus payable to such
employee under the Retention Bonus Program has been paid, the bonus shall, subject to the employee’s execution and non-revocation of a general
release of claims, become payable to such employee.
Awards under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program will be determined by iRobot’s Chief Executive Officer and
Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Corporate Communications, after reasonable consultation with Amazon.com. No employee is eligible to
receive a bonus under both the Transaction Bous Program and the Retention Bonus Program. No bonus under either the Transaction Bonus Program or
the Retention Bonus Program may exceed 100% of the applicable employee’s base salary. iRobot’s Chief Executive Officer is not eligible to receive a
bonus under either the Transaction Bonus Program or the Retention Bonus Program. iRobot’s other executive officers are eligible to receive bonuses
under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program and the aggregate amount of the bonuses the executive officers are eligible to
receive under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program is $2,240,000, including bonuses to the named executive officers as
described in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table below.
Executive Agreements
Each of iRobot’s executive officers is party to an executive agreement with iRobot that provides for severance benefits upon a termination of
employment by iRobot other than for cause within the period beginning
60
Table of Contents
on the date that is 45 days prior to the date of the public announcement of the execution of a definitive agreement for a change in control and ending on
the first anniversary of the effective date of a change in control, or if such executive officer resigns for good reason during the one-year period following
the effective date of a change in control (collectively, a “qualifying termination”). The merger will qualify as a “change in control” within the meaning of
each executive agreement, and each executive officer is eligible to receive the following severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination:
•
accelerated vesting of all unvested equity awards held by such executive officer as of the date of the termination of employment or, if later,
the date of announcement of the change in control;
•
an amount equal to 200% of the executive officer’s annual base salary at the highest annualized rate in effect during the period between
immediately prior to the effective date of the change in control and the date of termination of employment;
•
an amount equal to 200% of the executive officer’s highest target cash incentive compensation with respect to the period beginning in the
year prior to the year in which the effective date of the change in control occurs and ending in the year in which the executive officer’s
employment terminates; and
•
in the event that the executive officer elects continued health, vision and/or dental coverage under COBRA, payment of the portion of
monthly premium payments that iRobot pays for active employees for continued health, dental and vision benefits until the earliest of (a)
the second anniversary of the termination date, (b) the date on which the executive officer becomes covered under a comparable group plan
for such coverage, and (c) the date on which the executive officer ceases to be eligible for COBRA continuation for such coverage.
These severance payments and benefits under the executive agreements are subject to, among other things, the executive officer’s execution of a
separation agreement, including a general release of claims, in a form and of a scope reasonably acceptable to iRobot and the executive officer’s
continued compliance with any noncompetition, inventions and/or nondisclosure obligations owed to iRobot. The executive agreements also provide
that payments and benefits payable to each executive officer will be reduced so that no portion of such payments and benefits are subject to the excise
tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), unless the executive officer would be better off on an after-tax
basis receiving all such payments and benefits.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to iRobot’s named executive officers upon a
qualifying termination in connection with the merger, see “— Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers”
below. The estimated aggregate amount (excluding the value of accelerated vesting of unvested equity awards, which is described in “— Treatment of
Company Equity Awards” above) that would be payable to the Company’s two executive officers who are not named executive officers under the
executive agreements if they were to experience a qualifying termination on July 31, 2022 is $2,890,520.
New Arrangements with iRobot Executive Officers
On August 4, 2022, Mr. Angle entered into a letter agreement with Amazon.com Services LLC (“Amazon.com Services”) pursuant to which Mr.
Angle will serve as CEO, iRobot Corporation, effective as of the closing date of the transaction (the “Start Date”). The letter agreement amends the
executive agreement by and between Mr. Angle and the Company described under “Executive Agreements” above (the “Angle Executive Agreement”).
Under the letter agreement, Mr. Angle’s employment will be at-will and he will be entitled to an annual base salary of $350,000. Additionally, Mr. Angle is
eligible for a sign-on payment in the aggregate amount of $2,795,000, of which (i) $2,150,000 will be payable in equal pay period installments during the
one-year period following the Start Date, and (ii) the remaining $645,000 will be payable in equal pay period installments during the one-year period
following the first anniversary of the Start Date, in each case, subject to continued employment with Amazon.com Services through each such payment
date. If Mr. Angle’s employment with Amazon.com Services is terminated for any reason prior to any applicable payment date, he will receive one final
payment based on the days he worked in his final pay period.

Table of Contents
Subject to approval by the board of directors of Amazon.com, Mr. Angle will be granted a restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of
Amazon.com common stock valued at $5,810,500 (the “New Hire RSU Award”). The number of restricted stock units subject to the New Hire RSU Award
will be calculated based on the 30-trading-day trailing average closing price of Amazon.com common stock on the last trading day of the week prior to the
closing date and rounded to the nearest whole number. The New Hire RSU Award will vest and convert into shares of Amazon.com common stock over
the following vesting schedule, subject to Mr. Angle’s continued employment with Amazon.com Services through each applicable vesting date:
•
13% on the 15th day of the month in which the 18-month anniversary of the Start Date occurs,
•
13% on the 15th day of the month in which the 24-month anniversary of the Start Date occurs, and
•
9.25% on the 15th day of the month in which each of the 27-month, 30-month, 33-month, 36-month, 39-month, 42-month, 45-month and 48-
month anniversaries of the Start Date occur.
Additionally, following the closing date and subject to the approval of the board of directors of Amazon.com, Mr. Angle will be granted a restricted
stock unit award with respect to shares of Amazon.com common stock valued at $20,000,000 (the “Deal RSU Award”). The number of restricted stock
units subject to Mr. Angle’s Deal RSU Award will be calculated based on the 30-trading-day trailing average closing price of Amazon.com common stock
on the last trading day of the week prior to the closing date and rounded to the nearest whole number. The Deal RSU Award will vest and convert into
shares of Amazon.com common stock over the following vesting schedule, subject to your continued employment with Amazon.com Services through
each applicable vesting date:
•
15% on the 15th day of the month in which the first anniversary of the Start Date occurs,
•
5% on the 15th day of the month in which the second anniversary of the Start Date occurs,
•
55% on the 15th day of the month in which the third anniversary of the Start Date occurs, and
•
25% on the 15th day of the month in which the fourth anniversary of the Start Date occurs.
The letter agreement also provides that, effective as of the closing date, the Angle Executive Agreement is amended such that (i) Mr. Angle waives
any right he may have to terminate his employment on or following the Start Date for a Resignation for Good Reason Upon a Change in Control (as
defined in the Angle Executive Agreement) solely as a result of any changes occurring as a result of the closing of the merger agreement or any changes
set forth in the letter agreement (including without limitation Mr. Angle’s new compensation package, benefits, title, and associated responsibilities,
authority or duties) and such definition of Good Reason Upon a Change of Control is amended to reflect the foregoing, (ii) the New Hire RSU Award, the
Deal RSU Award and any other equity-based awards granted to Mr. Angle by Amazon.com following the Start Date shall not be subject to accelerated
vesting or continuing vesting upon termination of Mr. Angle’s employment for any reason, and (iii) any equity-based awards granted to Mr. Angle by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries between the date of the merger agreement and the closing date that remain unvested as of the closing date shall be
forfeited for no consideration, effective as of the closing date. In the event of an Involuntary Termination Upon a Change in Control (as defined in the
Angle Executive Agreement) or a Resignation for Good Reason Upon a Change in Control (as such definition in the Angle Executive Agreement is
modified by the letter agreement), Mr. Angle shall remain eligible to receive the severance and other termination benefits under the Angle Executive
Agreement (as modified by the letter agreement). Upon the first anniversary of the closing date, the Angle Executive Agreement’s Term (as defined in
such agreement) shall end pursuant to the Angle Executive Agreement without having any impact on Mr. Angle’s employment with Amazon.com
Services.
The letter agreement also provides that Mr. Angle’s employment is conditioned on him executing a Confidentiality and Invention Assignment
Agreement, which Mr. Angle executed on August 4, 2022.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
The merger agreement provides that after the effective time, Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the
individuals who on or prior to the effective time were officers or directors of iRobot or its subsidiaries or were serving at the request of iRobot as an
officer, director, member, trustee or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise with
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of iRobot or any of its subsidiaries at any time prior to the
effective time to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including with respect to advancement of expenses and attorneys’ fees and advancing
such expenses and fees without requiring any preliminary determination of entitlement subject to such individual’s affirmation or undertaking if required
under the DGCL).
Amazon.com and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time
existing as of August 4, 2022 in favor of the current and former directors and officers of iRobot or any of its subsidiaries or any of their predecessors and
the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director, as provided in iRobot’s or each of its subsidiaries’ respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) or in any agreement, will survive the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The merger agreement provides that after
the effective time, Amazon.com and the surviving corporation will (and Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to) fulfill and honor such
obligations to the maximum extent that iRobot or the applicable subsidiary would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them by applicable law.
In addition, for a period of six years following the effective time, the merger agreement provides that Amazon.com will, and will cause the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries to, cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification
and exculpation provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of iRobot and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the effective time, and during such six-year period, such provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
respect, except as required by applicable law.
In addition, iRobot will obtain, or Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to obtain, for a period of six years from and after the effective
time, “tail” insurance policies for the extension of (1) the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of iRobot’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance
policies and (2) iRobot’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the insured parties as iRobot’s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, subject to certain
qualifications and provided that in no event will the annual cost of such insurance coverage exceed during such period 300% of the current aggregate
annual premium paid by iRobot for such purpose and, if the cost of the insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the surviving corporation will obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers
The Golden Parachute Compensation table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of the Company’s named executive
officers would receive in connection with the merger, assuming that the merger were consummated and each such executive officer experienced a
qualifying termination on July 31, 2022 . The amounts below are determined using the merger consideration per share of Company common stock of
$61.00, and are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions
described in the footnotes to the table. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer
may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. The table below does not include compensation that is contingent upon services provided to
Amazon.com following the effective time, including under any employment arrangements that will become effective as of the closing of the merger.

The cash payments payable to each named executive officer consist of (i) cash severance payments under the executive agreements described
under “Executive Agreements” above equal to the sum of (a) 200% of the named executive officer’s annual base salary as of July 31, 2022, and (b)
200% of the named executive officer’s target cash incentive compensation as of July 31, 2022, and (ii) for named executive officers other than Mr.
Angle, the cash bonuses the named executive officer are eligible to receive pursuant to the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus
Program on the terms described under “Transaction Bonus Program and Retention Bonus Program” above. The severance payments are “double-

As described above, all outstanding RSUs and PSUs will be converted into cash awards payable in installments subject to the same time-vesting
and forfeiture provisions, but not performance-vesting provisions, as were applicable to such RSU or PSU award immediately prior to the effective
time, subject to “double-trigger” acceleration pursuant to the executive agreements upon a qualifying termination. Set forth below are the values of
each type of unvested equity-based award outstanding as of July 31, 2022 that would be payable upon the effective time, based on the merger
consideration per share of Company common stock of $61.00, if a qualifying termination occurred. This does not include additional equity grants
that could be granted after the date of the merger agreement and does not include shares that may be purchased under the ESPP, which are fully
vested at purchase. None of the named executive officers held any unvested Company options as of July 31, 2022. Vested Company options are

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",67,73
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This
discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Department regulations promulgated under the Code
(the “Treasury Regulations”), court decisions, published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and
other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the alternative minimum tax, the rules pertaining to “qualified small business
stock” or “Section 1244 stock”, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than
those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.
This discussion is limited to stockholders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). Further, this discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax
consequences that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may be relevant to stockholders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as insurance
companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, U.S. Holders
that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, stockholders who hold shares of common stock through an individual retirement or other tax-
deferred account, tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial
institutions, mutual funds, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements
treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations or other pass-through entities and investors in such pass-through entities,
real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, stockholders who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive
sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, stockholders who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity interest in Amazon.com immediately
after the merger, stockholders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent (5%) or more of Company’s common stock (by
vote or value); stockholders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or
resident outside the U.S.; stockholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of
common stock being taken into account in a “applicable financial statement” (as defined in the Code); stockholders who are controlled foreign
corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; and stockholders who
acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion also does
not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to (i) holders of options, restricted stock units or other equity securities or (ii) holders of shares of
common stock who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors
regarding the consequences of the merger.
65Table of Contents
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge
by the IRS in the event of litigation.
THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX PLANNING. WE URGE YOU TO
CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF THE ALTERNATIVE
MINIMUM TAX, THE UNEARNED INCOME MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION TAX, QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESS STOCK, AND FEDERAL ESTATE,
GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the U.S.;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and the control of one or more U.S. persons as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.
person.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a
foreign corporation, (ii) a nonresident alien individual, or (iii) a foreign estate or trust that in each case is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net-
income basis on income or gain from common stock.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S.
Holder and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger.
Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals, are generally taxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices,
such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax
treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), in which case such gain
generally will be subject to
66
Table of Contents
U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. Holders, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be
subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger, and certain other
requirements are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%), which gain may be
offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns
with respect to such losses.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may apply to the proceeds received by a
stockholder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification
number and certifies that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a certification of such stockholder’s foreign status on the
appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the
stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly known as
“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially
defined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and
provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and
debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also
generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity
provides the withholding agent with either a certification that it does not have any substantial direct or indirect U.S. owners or provides information
regarding substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and an applicable foreign country
may modify these requirements. FATCA withholding currently applies to payments of dividends. The Treasury Department has released proposed
regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) applicable to the gross proceeds of
a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may
generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Stockholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the disposition of common
stock pursuant to the merger.",73,75

HSR Clearance. Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until
notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust
67Table of Contents
Division (the “Antitrust Division”) of the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and all
statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act. The merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period, which begins when
Amazon.com and iRobot file Premerger Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division and the FTC, unless such waiting
period is earlier terminated by the Antitrust Division and the FTC. If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the Antitrust
Division or FTC issues a request for additional information or documentary material (a “Second Request”) from Amazon.com and iRobot, the waiting
period with respect to the merger would be extended until the 30th calendar day following the date of the parties’ substantial compliance with the second
request. After that time, absent the agreement of Amazon.com and iRobot, the acquisition can be blocked only by court order. The Antitrust Division and
the FTC may terminate the applicable waiting period at any time before its expiration and the parties may agree with the DOJ or FTC to delay
consummation of the Merger for a specified period of time.
At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action
under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or to require one or both of the parties to divest assets, license or hold
separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or to agree to other remedies.
In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or to require one or both of the parties to divest assets, license or hold separate assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or to agree to other remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust
laws under some circumstances.
Other Regulatory Clearances. Merger control filings or clearances are required or advisable in other jurisdictions, including clearance by the
European Commission. The merger cannot be consummated until after the mandatory approval requirements outside of the United States have been
obtained under applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws. The relevant authorities could take such actions under the applicable antitrust and
foreign investment laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial
assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or
requiring the parties to agree to other remedies. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay
the completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger.
Although Amazon.com and iRobot believe that the merger will not violate the antitrust or foreign investment laws and expect that all required
regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, Amazon.com and iRobot cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be
timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions,
restrictions, qualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the merger, including the requirement to divest assets, license or hold
separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other remedies, or require changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or that a challenge to the merger on antitrust or foreign investment grounds will not be made, or if such challenge is made, what the result will
be. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take
to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time
between the approval of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement by stockholders and the completion of the merger.

In connection with the merger agreement, a complaint has been filed as an individual action in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, captioned Reid v. iRobot Corp., et al., 22-cv-7498 (filed September 1, 2022). The foregoing complaint is referred to as the “Merger
Action”.
68Table of Contents
The Merger Action generally alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on August 25, 2022 misrepresents
and/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the Company’s financial projections, the analyses performed by the financial advisor to
the iRobot board of directors in connection with the merger, potential conflicts of interest of the Company’s officers and directors, and the events that led
to the signing of the merger agreement. The Merger Action asserts violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder against all defendants (the Company and its board of directors) and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company’s
directors. The Merger Action seeks, among other things, an injunction enjoining the stockholder vote on the merger and the consummation of the merger
unless and until certain additional information is disclosed to iRobot stockholders, costs of the action, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and experts’
fees, and other relief the court may deem just and proper.
The Company cannot predict the outcome of the Merger Action. The Company believes that the Merger Action is without merit and the Company
and the individual defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Merger Action and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar
complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings, unless such
disclosure is required by law.

IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,When the Merger Becomes Effective,"When the Merger Becomes Effective
The closing of the merger will take place at 9:00 a.m., New York time, on the third business day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the
merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) is satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger agreement, unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing between iRobot and Amazon.com. For purposes of the merger agreement, “business day” refers to any day ending at 11:59
p.m., New York time, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which the Department of State of the State of Delaware and banks in the County of New York,
New York are open for general business.
On the closing date, iRobot and Amazon.com will file the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The merger will
become effective at the time when the certificate of merger has been duly filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the certificate of merger.
We are working toward completing the merger as promptly as possible, but as of the date of this proxy statement we cannot accurately estimate the
closing date of the merger because the merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions to
Amazon.com, Merger Sub and the Company’s respective obligations to consummate the merger, some of which are not within the parties’ control. There
may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger, and it is possible that the merger will not be completed
at all. After the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors will not have the right to terminate the merger agreement in order to
accept any alternative acquisition proposal. We expect to complete the merger promptly after the requisite company vote is obtained and all required
regulatory clearances have been received.

owned by Amazon.com, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com and shares owned by the Company or any wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (the shares referred to in clause (1), the “cancelled shares”) and (2) shares

such dissenting shares will be treated as if they had never been dissenting shares and instead had been converted at the effective time into the right to
receive the merger consideration.

underlying such decline, if not otherwise excluded, has resulted in a material adverse effect);

excluded, has resulted in a material adverse effect);

not apply to references to “material adverse effect” in the representations and warranties as to governmental filings and the absence of

resulting from the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the performance of a party’s obligations thereunder or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby);

claim, demand or action (including any class action or derivative litigation) asserted, commenced or threatened by, on behalf of or in the
name of, against or otherwise involving iRobot, the iRobot board of directors, any committee thereof and/or any of iRobot’s directors or
officers relating directly or indirectly to the merger agreement, the merger or any related transaction (including any such claim, demand or
action based on allegations that the iRobot’s entry into the merger agreement or the terms and conditions of the merger agreement or any

iRobot in good faith seeks prior written approval from Amazon.com for iRobot to take such action, and Amazon.com unreasonably denies

and
•
certain other exceptions set forth in the Company disclosure schedule.
However, with respect to the matters described in the foregoing first, second, third, fourth, fifth and eighth bullet points above, such change, effect,
occurrence or development may be taken into account to the extent that it has a disproportionate adverse effect on iRobot and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to other companies operating in the industries in which iRobot and its subsidiaries conduct business, in which case only the
incremental disproportionate adverse effect may be taken into account in determining whether or not there has been a material adverse effect.

iRobot will provide Amazon.com with a copy of the intended communication (including, in the case of any such oral communications, copies of scripts,
talking points or other similar materials). Any such communication will be subject to Amazon.com’s consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and Amazon.com and iRobot will cooperate in providing any such communication.
In addition, Amazon.com has agreed that, after August 4, 2022 and until the effective time, neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will acquire Control
of, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding to acquire Control of, (i) any of certain specified companies or any of their respective
subsidiaries as set forth in the Company disclosure schedule or (ii) the vacuum or robotic vacuum business (or any part thereof) of certain specified
companies or any of certain of their respective subsidiaries as set forth in the Company disclosure schedule. Solely for purposes of the comment
described in the preceding sentence, “Control” means owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, securities or other ownership interests representing
more than 50% of the voting power of all outstanding stock or ownership interests of any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or

would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined below);
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to any acquisition proposal or any inquiry,

to which those discussions are prohibited by the terms of the merger agreement);

reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
•
other than as required by the directors’ fiduciary duties, waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any “standstill” or confidentiality

80Table of Contents
revenues, net income or total assets (including equity securities of any of iRobot’s subsidiaries and equity securities of any other entity) of
iRobot; or

Existing Discussions or Negotiations
Pursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and financial advisors to, and
to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations
with any person conducted before August 4, 2022 with respect to any acquisition proposal or proposal or transaction that could reasonably be expected
to lead to an acquisition proposal. iRobot has agreed to, within 24 hours after execution of the merger agreement, deliver a written notice to each such
person providing only that iRobot is ending all discussions and negotiations with such person with respect to any acquisition proposal or proposal or
transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, which notice also will request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information concerning iRobot and any of its subsidiaries. iRobot has also agreed to terminate, within 24 hours of the execution of the merger
agreement, all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such persons.
During the period commencing on August 4, 2022 and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger agreement and the
effective time, iRobot must not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, “standstill” or similar agreement entered into in
connection with any acquisition proposal proposed, discussed or negotiated on or prior to August 4, 2022 to which iRobot or any of its subsidiaries is a
party and will enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable laws, the provisions of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the merger agreement, iRobot will be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality,
“standstill” or similar obligation of any person if the iRobot board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Receipt of Acquisition Proposals
Notwithstanding certain provisions of the merger agreement described above, prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained, if iRobot
receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal not solicited in violation of the iRobot’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, and if
the iRobot board of directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and an outside financial advisor that (1) based on the
information then available and after consultation with its outside financial advisor, the acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to result in a superior proposal (as defined below) and that did not result from a breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger
agreement (2) the failure to take the applicable action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, then iRobot may:
•
provide information (including non-public information) to the person making the acquisition proposal; provided, that in the event the
information has not previously been made available to Amazon.com, iRobot must promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) provide the
information to Amazon.com, and that, prior to furnishing the information, iRobot must receive from the person making the acquisition
proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with confidentiality and use terms not less restrictive in the aggregate to the other party
than the terms in the confidentiality agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com are on Amazon.com (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement with such other party need not contain “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making of any
acquisition proposal); provided that iRobot will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to August 4, 2022
that prohibits iRobot from providing any

information to Amazon.com in accordance with the merger agreement or otherwise prohibits iRobot from complying with its obligations
under the merger agreement; provided, further, that iRobot will not provide information to any person pursuant to any confidentiality
agreement entered into prior to August 4, 2022 unless such person agrees prior to receipt of the information to waive any provision that
would prohibit iRobot from providing any information to Amazon.com in accordance with the merger agreement or otherwise would prohibit
iRobot from complying with its obligations under the merger agreement; and
•
engage in or participate in discussions and/or negotiations with that person regarding the acquisition proposal.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means an unsolicited, bona fide written acquisition proposal first made after August 4,
2022 that did not result from a breach of iRobot’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement and that would result in any person or group
becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of iRobot or assets
representing more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets (including equity securities of iRobot’s subsidiaries and equity
securities of any other entity) of iRobot, that the iRobot board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its outside financial advisor, taking into account all legal, financial, financing and regulatory aspects of the acquisition proposal, the identity of the
person(s) making the proposal and the likelihood of the proposal being completed in accordance with its terms and all other matters that iRobot board of
directors considers appropriate in good faith, that, if completed, would result in a transaction (1) more favorable to iRobot’s stockholders from a financial
point of view than the merger and (2) that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account any regulatory, financing or approval requirements
and any other aspects considered relevant by the iRobot board of directors (after taking into account any binding revisions to the terms of the merger
agreement proposed by Amazon.com as described in the section entitled “— Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).
iRobot must promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) give written notice to Amazon.com if iRobot or any of its subsidiaries receives (1) any
inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer with respect to an acquisition proposal, (2) any request by any person or group for information in
connection with or with respect to any acquisition proposal or (3) any request by any person or group for discussions or negotiations, or to initiate or
continue discussions or negotiations, with respect to an acquisition proposal, setting forth in the notice the name of the person or group and the material
terms and conditions of any such acquisition proposal (including, if applicable, complete copies of any written request, inquiry, proposal, indication of
interest or offer, including proposed agreements and any other written communications) and thereafter must keep Amazon.com reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of changes in the status and terms of any such proposal or offer (including any
amendments thereto) and any changes to the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

The iRobot board of directors has unanimously recommended that iRobot stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement. The merger agreement permits the iRobot board of directors to effect a change of recommendation (as defined below) only in certain limited
circumstances, as described below.
Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, neither the iRobot board of directors nor any committee thereof may:
•
withhold or withdraw or fail to make when required by the merger agreement (or publicly propose or publicly resolve to withhold or
withdraw or fail to make when required by the merger agreement) the company recommendation with respect to the merger;
82Table of Contents
•
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or publicly resolve to qualify or modify) the company recommendation with respect to the merger in a
manner adverse to Amazon.com;
•
approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable, any acquisition proposal;
•
fail to include the company recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
if any acquisition proposal that is structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company common stock is
commenced pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act, fail to recommend against acceptance of the offer by iRobot’s stockholders prior to
the earlier of (1) the date of the meeting of the holders of Company common stock to consider and vote upon the approval and adoption of
the merger agreement and (2) 11 business days (which for this purpose will be used as the term is used in Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act)
after commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer;
•
approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
collaboration agreement or other agreement with respect to, or that is intended or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition
proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as described in the section entitled “— Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Receipt
of Acquisition Proposals” relating to any acquisition proposal) (referred to in this proxy statement as an “alternative acquisition
agreement”); or
•
cause or permit iRobot to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.
The actions described in all of the bullet points above other than the last bullet point are referred to in this proxy statement as a “change of
recommendation.”
However, before the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors may effect a change of recommendation and/or terminate the
merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, in each case if the iRobot board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that an acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal and the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a change of
recommendation or terminating the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, (1) iRobot must have given Amazon.com at least five business
days’ prior written notice of its intention to do so, (2) iRobot must have afforded Amazon.com the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with iRobot to
enable Amazon.com to propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (3) at the end of the notice period,
the iRobot board of directors must have considered in good faith the binding written offer and any other information it deems appropriate in good faith,
and must have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, that the superior proposal
continues to constitute a superior proposal if the changes proposed in the binding offer by Amazon.com were to be given effect.
In addition, before the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors may effect a change of recommendation in response to an
intervening event (as defined below) if the iRobot board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a
change of recommendation in response to an intervening event, (1) iRobot must have given Amazon.com at least five business days’ prior written notice
of its intention to do so, (2) iRobot must have afforded Amazon.com the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with iRobot to enable Amazon.com to
propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (3) at the end of the notice period, the iRobot board of
directors must have considered in good faith the binding written offer and any other information it deems appropriate in good faith, and must have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, that the failure to effect a change of
recommendation
83
Table of Contents
would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law if the changes proposed in the binding offer by Amazon.com were to be given
effect. Under the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means a change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or development that (i) was neither
known by nor reasonably foreseeable by iRobot or the iRobot board of directors as of August 4, 2022 (or, if known, the material consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable) and (ii) becomes known by the iRobot board of directors prior to the receipt of the requisite company vote;
provided, that in no event will any of the following constitute or be deemed to be an intervening event: (1) the receipt, existence or terms of an acquisition
proposal or any matter relating thereto, (2) changes in the stock price of iRobot, (3) any breach by iRobot of the merger agreement or (4) the fact, in and of
itself, that iRobot exceeds internal or published projections (it being understood, however, that the facts or causes underlying or contributing to any of
the matters described in the preceding clauses (2) or (4) may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event has
occurred); provided, further, that an acquisition proposal that resulted from a breach of iRobot’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement
may not be the basis for an intervening event.
In the event of any modification to the financial terms or any other material terms of any acquisition proposal, iRobot must satisfy the notice
requirement described above with a new written notice to Amazon.com, and comply with the negotiation requirements described above, provided that the
subsequent notice period (and any subsequent notice period thereafter) will be three business days instead of five business days.
The merger agreement does not prohibit iRobot or the iRobot board of directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of iRobot a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the
stockholders of iRobot that is required by applicable law; provided, however, that if such disclosure has the effect of withholding or withdrawing,
adversely qualifying, modifying or failing to make when required by the merger agreement the company recommendation, such disclosure will be deemed
to be a change of recommendation and Amazon.com will have the right to terminate the merger agreement. Any “stop, look and listen” or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act will not be deemed to be a change of recommendation; provided that
any such disclosure that has the effect of withholding, withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to, or failing to make when required
by the merger agreement, the company recommendation will be deemed to be a change of recommendation unless the iRobot board of directors expressly
publicly reaffirms the company recommendation in such communication without any qualification.

notice of, and will convene and hold a meeting of the holders of shares (the “iRobot stockholders’ meeting”) (which will be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date that is either (A) the third business day after the day that is ten days after filing the preliminary proxy statement if,
prior to such date, the SEC does not provide comments or indicates that it does not plan to provide comments or (B) within three business days after the
date of being informed by the SEC staff that it has no further comments on the preliminary proxy statement) to consider and vote upon the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and will not postpone or adjourn such meeting, except to the extent advised by
counsel to be necessary to comply with law or pursuant to the following sentence. iRobot will schedule the iRobot stockholders’ meeting to be held
within thirty (30) days of the initial mailing of the proxy statement (or if iRobot’s nationally recognized proxy solicitor advises that thirty (30) days from
the date of mailing the proxy statement is insufficient time to submit and obtain the requisite company vote, such later date as advised by such proxy
solicitor and to which Amazon.com consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the merger agreement, (i) iRobot may adjourn, recess or postpone, and at the request of Amazon.com, it must adjourn, recess or postpone, the
iRobot stockholders’ meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional proxies, if iRobot or Amazon.com, respectively, reasonably believes there will be
insufficient shares represented (either virtually or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the iRobot stockholders’
meeting or to obtain the

requisite company vote (provided, that, (x) unless agreed in writing by iRobot and Amazon.com, all such adjournments, recesses or postponements will
be for periods of no more than ten (10) business days each and (y) in no event will the record date of the iRobot stockholders’ meeting be changed

or postpone the iRobot stockholders’ meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the proxy statement that is
required by applicable law is provided to the stockholders of iRobot for the amount of time required by law in advance of the iRobot stockholders’
meeting. Subject to iRobot’s rights to effect a change of recommendation in response to an intervening event or a superior proposal and to terminate the
merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, as described in the section entitled “— Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative
Acquisition Agreement”, the iRobot board will include the company recommendation in the proxy statement and will take all lawful action to obtain the
requisite company vote. Without the prior written consent of Amazon.com, the adoption of the merger agreement will be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by law to be voted on by the iRobot stockholders in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement)
that iRobot will propose to be acted on by the iRobot stockholders at the iRobot stockholders’ meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
but subject to iRobot’s rights to terminate the merger agreement as described in the section entitled “— Termination”, iRobot has agreed that its
obligations described in this section will not be affected by the occurrence of a change of recommendation, the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to iRobot or any other person of any acquisition proposal or any event constituting or that could constitute an intervening
event.
iRobot has agreed (1) to provide Amazon.com periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested,
promptly providing daily voting reports to the extent received from iRobot’s proxy solicitor) and (2) to give written notice to Amazon.com one business
day prior to the iRobot stockholders’ meeting and on the day of, but prior to, the iRobot stockholders’ meeting of the status of the requisite company

(PROPOSAL 2)
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, iRobot is providing its stockholders with a
separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers in connection
with the merger, as described in the table entitled “Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers” under “The
Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of iRobot approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to iRobot’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, and
the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger — Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers,” including the footnotes to the table and the
related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation
proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either iRobot or Amazon.com. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted and the
merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements
and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of iRobot stockholders.
The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of iRobot’s named executive officers on an advisory basis requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and against with respect to this proposal.
The iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of iRobot vote “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal.

time the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If this
adjournment proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned on one or more occasions by the iRobot board of directors to any date or

not permitted to postpone or adjourn the iRobot stockholders’ meeting, except to the extent advised by counsel to be necessary to comply with law, and
except that iRobot may adjourn, recess or postpone, and at the request of Amazon.com, it will adjourn, recess or postpone, the iRobot stockholders’
meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional proxies, if iRobot or Amazon.com, respectively, reasonably believes there will be insufficient shares of
iRobot common stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the iRobot stockholders’ meeting or to obtain the
requisite company vote. Any other postponement or adjournment would require the consent of the Company and Amazon.com. However, unless agreed
in writing by iRobot and Amazon.com, any adjournments, recesses or postponements will be for periods of no more than ten business days each. iRobot
may also adjourn, recess or postpone the iRobot stockholders’ meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
this proxy statement is provided to iRobot stockholders for the amount of time required by law in advance of the iRobot stockholders’ meeting. If the
special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke
them at any time before their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a
proxy and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on the
adjournment proposal, your shares of common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.
The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if Proposal 1 is approved by the requisite number of shares of iRobot common
stock at the special meeting.
The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and
vice versa.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the votes properly cast for and against with respect to this proposal.
The iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if a vote on
the adjournment proposal is called.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF IROBOT STOCKHOLDERS",106,108
IROBOT CORP_20220907_DEFM14A_20329897_4514467.Pdf,APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF IROBOT STOCKHOLDERS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF IROBOT STOCKHOLDERS
If the merger is consummated, iRobot stockholders or beneficial owners who continuously hold their shares of iRobot common stock through the
effective date of the merger, who do not vote in favor of the merger, who properly demand in writing an appraisal of their shares delivered to the Company
prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and who comply with, and do not validly withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the applicable provisions of Delaware law will be entitled to appraisal rights to receive, in cash, the
fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in connection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL (“Section 262”).
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any
legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that iRobot stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references
in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of iRobot common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein,
and all such references to a “beneficial owner” mean a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person unless otherwise expressly noted herein.
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners who: (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal of their
shares to iRobot prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; (ii) do not vote in favor of the merger; (iii)
continuously hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, such shares through the effective date of the merger; and (iv) otherwise comply with, and
do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the applicable provisions set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have
their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of iRobot common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount
determined to be “fair value.” However, assuming shares of iRobot common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the
merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as
to all iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds
1% of the outstanding shares of iRobot common stock (as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262) or (b) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b), and the assumption that shares of iRobot
common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the merger, are referred to in this summary as the “ownership
thresholds”).
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty
(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the
stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement
constitutes iRobot’s notice to iRobot stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be
accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In
connection with the merger, any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its
right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the
loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the
merger consideration described in the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal
of shares of iRobot common stock, iRobot believes that if a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner considers exercising such rights, that person should
seek the advice of legal counsel.
100Table of Contents
iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of iRobot common stock must do ALL
of the following:
•
the person must not vote in favor of the merger;
•
the person must deliver to iRobot a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement;
•
the person must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective
date of the merger (if a stockholder or beneficial owner transfers the shares before the effective time, such person will lose appraisal rights
with respect to the shares so transferred);
•
the person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal or the surviving corporation must file a petition
in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the “fair value” of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the effective date of the merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so; and
•
the person must otherwise comply with Section 262 of the DGCL.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Making a Written Demand
Any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to iRobot, before the vote is taken on the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, a written demand for the appraisal of the iRobot stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s shares. The person making
the written demand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for appraisal is made, and such
person must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which such demand relates through the effective date of the merger.
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. In the
case of a holder of record of iRobot common stock, a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in
favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the iRobot stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify
any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a iRobot stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights
must ensure that the proxy submitted contains instructions to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting. In
the case of a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in “street name” for their customers do not have
discretionary authority to vote those shares on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement without specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the beneficial owner provides such
instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” instructs such person’s broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person’s shares in
favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver
of such beneficial owner’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a beneficial owner who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either not provide any instructions to such person’s broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal
to approve and adopt the merger agreement or must instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement or abstain from voting on such proposal.
Neither voting against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting on such proposal will, in and of itself,
constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
101
Table of Contents
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. A iRobot stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
A demand for appraisal made by a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record or beneficial
owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform iRobot of the identity of such stockholder or beneficial owner. In addition, in the case of a demand for
appraisal made by a iRobot beneficial owner, the demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made,
be accompanied by documentary evidence of the beneficial owner’s ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or securities account statement containing
such information or a letter from the broker or other record holder of such shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary
evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by
the surviving corporation under Section 262 and to be set forth on the verified list required by subsection (f) of Section 262 (discussed further below).
Whether made by an iRobot stockholder or a beneficial owner, a written demand for appraisal must state that the person intends thereby to demand
appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are held of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand should be executed by or on behalf of such holder of record or beneficial owner, and
if the shares are held of record or beneficially owned by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be
executed by or on behalf of all such joint holders of record or beneficial owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more
joint stockholders or beneficial owners, as applicable, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record or beneficial owner; however,
the agent must identify the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, respectively, and should expressly disclose that, in executing the
demand, the agent is acting as agent for such record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, as applicable.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
iRobot Corporation
8 Crosby Drive
Bedford, MA 01730
Attention: Secretary
Any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who has delivered a written demand to iRobot and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares and accept the
merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to iRobot a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of the
merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares and to accept the merger
consideration with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each iRobot stockholder
who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant
102
Table of Contents
to Section 262 and has not voted in favor of the merger, and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal in such person’s name pursuant to
Section 262, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation or any iRobot stockholder or beneficial
owner who has demanded appraisal of such person’s shares and otherwise complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving
corporation in the case of a petition filed by a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the “fair value” of the shares held by
all persons entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and iRobot
stockholders and beneficial owners should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
“fair value” of the shares of iRobot common stock. Accordingly, any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who desires to have their shares appraised
by the Delaware Court of Chancery should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of iRobot common stock
within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner to file such a petition within the period
specified in Section 262 could nullify the person’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and
who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which iRobot has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such
person’s name, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate
number). Such statement must be given by the surviving corporation to the requesting person within ten (10) days after receipt by the surviving
corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,
whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the
surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly
verified list (which we refer to in this summary as the “verified list”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for
their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the surviving corporation and all persons shown on
the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The costs of these notices are borne by the surviving corporation. After notice to iRobot stockholders
and beneficial owners as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those
persons who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require
the persons who demanded an appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any person fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss
the proceedings as to such person. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all iRobot stockholders and beneficial
owners who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then all
iRobot stockholders’ and beneficial owners’ right to an appraisal will cease.
Determination of “Fair Value”
After determining the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
103
Table of Contents
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of iRobot common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the “fair value.” Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the
merger through the date of payment of the judgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date the judgment is paid. However, at any
time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) any interest
accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary
cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
In determining “fair value,” the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining “fair value” in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Supreme Court of
Delaware stated that, in making this determination of “fair value,” the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Delaware Court of Chancery may
consider in determining fair value and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction price should be given “considerable weight.” Section
262 provides that “fair value” is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,”
but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of
Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as so determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, “fair value” under Section 262. No representation is made
as to the outcome of the appraisal of “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration.
Neither iRobot nor Amazon.com anticipates offering more than the merger consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights, and each of iRobot and
Amazon.com reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding,
that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of iRobot common stock is less than the merger consideration.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name
appears on the verified list may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights. When
the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment
104
Table of Contents
of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled thereto and upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may
order. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced. The costs of the
appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name
appears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also
order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro
rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 262(k). In the
absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
From and after the effective date of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares
will be entitled to vote such shares of iRobot common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock,
except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of iRobot common stock, if any, payable to iRobot stockholders as of a time prior to the
effective time. If any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of iRobot common stock under Section 262
validly withdraws, fails to perfect, or otherwise loses, such holder’s or beneficial owner’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of iRobot common
stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration. A person will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, his, her or its right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the
merger or if neither of the ownership thresholds is met. As described above, a person may validly withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal if the
person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares in
accordance with Section 262.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any iRobot
stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
The foregoing summary of the rights of the iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not
purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by such persons to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires adherence to the applicable provisions of
the DGCL.

The Company held its annual meeting of iRobot stockholders (the “2022 annual meeting”) on May 27, 2022. In light of the special meeting, the
Company will hold an annual meeting of iRobot stockholders in the year 2023 only if the merger is not completed and iRobot stockholders will continue to
be entitled to attend and participate in such meeting.
Generally, iRobot stockholders have the opportunity to submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the
annual meeting of iRobot stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to our Secretary at least 120 days before the date of our proxy statement
for the previous year’s annual meeting, and otherwise complying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. As described in our annual
proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting filed on April 11, 2022, iRobot stockholders have the opportunity to submit proper proposals for inclusion in
our proxy statement and for consideration at the annual meeting of iRobot stockholders to be held in 2023 (if such meeting is held) by submitting their
proposals in writing to our Secretary at the Company’s principal executive offices no later than the close of business on December 12, 2022 and otherwise
complying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. In addition, iRobot stockholders who meet the applicable eligibility requirements
under the proxy access provision of our bylaws and wish to include nominees for our board of directors in our annual proxy statement for the 2023 annual
meeting, or stockholders who wish to make a proposal at the 2023 annual meeting (other than a proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 or pursuant to the
proxy access provision of our bylaws), must in each case notify us between January 27, 2023 and February 26, 2023. If a stockholder who wishes to
present a proposal fails to notify us by February 26, 2023 and such proposal is brought before the 2023 annual meeting, then under the SEC’s proxy rules,
the proxies solicited by iRobot management with respect to the 2023 annual meeting will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to the
stockholder’s proposal on the persons selected by iRobot management to vote the proxies. If a stockholder makes a timely notification, the proxies may
still exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances consistent with the SEC’s proxy rules. To comply with the universal proxy rules (once
effective), stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the iRobot’s nominees must provide notice that sets forth
the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than March 28, 2023.
A copy of the full text of the bylaws provisions governing the notice requirements set forth above may be obtained by writing to our Secretary. In
order to curtail controversy as to the date on which we received a proposal, it is suggested that proponents submit stockholders’ proposals by Certified
Mail, Return Receipt Requested, to iRobot Corporation, 8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730, Attention: Secretary.

Members of the Board:
We understand that iRobot Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Amazon.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and
Martin Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”). The
Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than (a) shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case, not held on
behalf of third parties and (b) Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), will cease to be outstanding and will cease to exist as
of the effective time of the Merger and will be converted into the right to receive $61.00 per share in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft, dated as of August 3, 2022, of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Merger
Agreement”) and certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the
Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including
financial projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and
financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading
activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common
Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we performed such other analyses, reviewed such
other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections,
we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and the Board of Directors of
the Company, that the Company Projections have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to such
