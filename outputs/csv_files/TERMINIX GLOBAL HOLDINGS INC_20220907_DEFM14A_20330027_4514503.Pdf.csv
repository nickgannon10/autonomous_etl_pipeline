TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a stockholder of Terminix, may have
regarding the transaction and the other matters being considered at the Terminix special meeting. You are
urged to carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus in their entirety because this section may not provide all the information that is
important to you regarding these matters. Please refer to the section of this proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “Summary” beginning on page 20 for a summary of important information regarding the merger
agreement, the transaction and the related transactions. Additional important information is contained in
the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus. You
may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, without charge,
by following the instructions under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can
Find Additional Information” beginning on page 328.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because Terminix has agreed to be acquired by
Rentokil Initial through (1) a merger of Merger Sub I with and into Terminix (which we refer to as the
“first merger”) with Terminix surviving the first merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, and (2)
immediately following the first merger, a merger of Terminix with and into Merger Sub II (which we refer
to as the “second merger” and together with the first merger, the “transaction”) with Merger Sub II
surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco and an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Rentokil Initial. The merger agreement, which governs the terms and conditions of the
transaction, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.
Your vote is required in connection with the transaction. Terminix is sending these materials to its
stockholders to help them decide how to vote their shares with respect to the adoption of the merger
agreement, among other important matters.
What matters am I being asked to vote on?
In order to complete the transaction, among other things, Terminix stockholders must adopt the merger
agreement in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), which proposal is
referred to as the “merger proposal.”
Terminix is holding the Terminix special meeting to obtain approval of the merger proposal. At the
Terminix special meeting, Terminix stockholders will also be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to
approve on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Terminix’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement (which proposal we refer to as the “compensation proposal”).
Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The approval of the
merger proposal is a condition to the obligations of Terminix to complete the transaction. The approval
of the compensation proposal is not a condition to the obligations of Terminix to complete the
transaction.
When and where will the Terminix special meeting take place?
The Terminix special meeting will be held virtually via the Internet on October 6, 2022, beginning at 8:30
a.m., Eastern Time. The Terminix special meeting will be held solely via live webcast and there will not be
a physical meeting location. Terminix stockholders will be able to attend the Terminix special meeting
online and vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TMX2022SM (which we refer to as the “special meeting website”).
If you choose to attend the Terminix special meeting and vote your shares during the Terminix special
meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number located on your proxy card as described in the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Terminix Special Meeting - Attending the
Terminix Special Meeting” beginning on page 70.
If you hold your shares in “street name” you may only vote them via the special meeting website if you
obtain a specific control number from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote
the shares. Even if you plan to attend the Terminix special meeting, Terminix recommends that
6 Q: 
A: 
Q: 
A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later
decide not to or become unable to attend the Terminix special meeting.
Does my vote matter?
Yes, your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The merger cannot
be completed unless, among other things, the merger proposal is approved by holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote. As of August 15, 2022,
the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, Terminix directors and
executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote less than 1% of the
total outstanding shares of Terminix common stock. Although no Terminix director or executive officer
has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, Terminix currently expects that all of its
directors and executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the
compensation proposal.
A failure to return or submit your proxy or to vote at the Terminix special meeting as provided in this
proxy statement/prospectus will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. The
failure to return or submit your proxy and to attend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on
the compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present), but the failure of any shares present or
represented at the Terminix special meeting to vote on the proposal will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the compensation proposal. The Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends that
you vote “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the compensation proposal.
What will Terminix stockholders receive for their shares if the transaction is completed?
If the transaction is completed, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Terminix
outstanding (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holders of such shares and subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the
merger agreement, as described in the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132 and “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of
Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135, either (1) a
number of American depositary shares of Rentokil Initial (“Rentokil Initial ADSs”) (each representing a
beneficial interest in five ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial (“Rentokil Initial ordinary shares”)) equal to
(A) 1.0619 (the “exchange ratio”) plus (B) the quotient of $11.00 (the “per share cash amount”) and the
volume weighted average price (measured in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial ADSs (measured using the
volume weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by the number of Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the trading day that is two trading
days prior to the closing date of the transaction (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by
Rentokil Initial and Terminix) (such trading day, the “measurement day,” such price, the “Rentokil Initial
ADS price,” and such number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, the “stock consideration”) or (2) an amount in
cash, without interest, and in U.S. dollars equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product of
the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial ADS price (the “cash consideration” ). We refer to the stock
consideration and the cash consideration payable per share of Terminix common stock in the
transaction, as applicable, as the “merger consideration.” Any Terminix stockholder who does not make
an election will be deemed to have made an election to receive stock consideration. Each Terminix
stockholder will receive cash in U.S. dollars (without interest) in lieu of any fractional Rentokil Initial
ADSs that such stockholder would otherwise receive in the transaction. Any cash amounts to be
received by a Terminix stockholder in lieu of any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs will be rounded down
to the nearest cent.
The total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid
under the terms of the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual election preferences. The
Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (which we refer to as the “NYSE”) and are expected to trade under the symbol “RTO.” Based
on the number of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares outstanding on
August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, we expect that former Terminix
stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction would own Rentokil Initial ADSs
representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial, and Rentokil
7 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 74.3% of the
outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are traded on the London
Stock Exchange plc’s main market for listed securities (which we refer to as the “LSE”) under the symbol
“RTO.” Terminix common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “TMX.” We encourage you to
obtain current quotes for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the common stock of Terminix.
The value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of
the measurement day will be substantially the same. For example, as of July 15, 2022 (which date has
been selected solely for illustrative purposes), Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted share price was
£5.0825 (expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-
U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.1855. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS
price would be $30.13 and, accordingly:
the per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $42.99 which is (A) $11.00,
the per share cash amount, plus (B) $31.99, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.13,
the Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date; and
the per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4270
(which have an approximate value as of such date of $42.99) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange
ratio, plus (B) 0.3651, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.13, the Rentokil
Initial ADS price as of such date.
As a result, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per
share stock consideration was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. The
consideration to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, to automatic adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132
to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the
transaction equal the aggregate amount agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of
the potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and
Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135.
The market value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders will fluctuate with the market
price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and will not be known at the time that Terminix stockholders
vote on the transaction. Based on Rentokil Initial’s five-day average daily volume weighted share price
and the five-day average of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period
spanning December 6, 2021 to December 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger
consideration to Terminix stockholders was approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock.
As described in the prior paragraph, based on Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted average share price
and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of the
merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common
stock. To further demonstrate how the implied value of the merger consideration may fluctuate over
time, we note that as of August 31, 2022 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus), Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted share price was £5.2331 (expressed in whole
pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate was
1.1638. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would be $30.45 and,
accordingly:
the per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $43.33 which is (A) $11.00,
the per share cash amount, plus (B) $32.33, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.45,
the Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date; and
the per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4231
(which have an approximate value on such date of $43.33) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange
ratio, plus (B) 0.3612, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.45, the Rentokil
Initial ADS price as of such date.

transaction equal the aggregate amount agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of
the potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and
Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135.
The market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the merger consideration
could be greater than, less than or the same as their market price or implied value, as applicable, on the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Terminix special meeting. Accordingly, you
should obtain current market quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock
before deciding how to vote with respect to the merger proposal. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and
Terminix common stock are traded on the LSE and the NYSE, under the symbols “RTO” and “TMX,”
respectively. For more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by Terminix
stockholders (including the applicable allocation and proration provisions and detailed illustrations
thereof) if the transaction is completed, see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132 and “The Merger Agreement - 
Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page

What is an American depositary share?
An American depositary share, or ADS, represents a specified number of securities of a non-U.S.
company deposited with a custodian bank. Each Rentokil Initial ADS will represent five Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares. Rentokil Initial ADSs constituting any of the merger consideration will be issued in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depository receipt evidencing such Rentokil
Initial ADSs is required under applicable law. The Rentokil Initial ADSs will be issued pursuant to the
terms of the deposit agreement.
If I am a Terminix stockholder, how do I make an election for the type of merger consideration that I prefer to
receive?
Each holder of record of Terminix common stock as of September 6, 2022 will be mailed a form of election
at least 20 business days in advance of the first effective time. Each Terminix stockholder should specify
in the form of election (1) the number of shares of Terminix common stock that such stockholder elects
to have exchanged for the cash consideration and (2) the number of shares of Terminix common stock
that such stockholder elects to have exchanged for the stock consideration. Any Terminix stockholder
who does not make an election will be deemed to have made an election to receive the stock
consideration. Any Terminix stockholder who votes against the merger proposal is still entitled to make
a cash/stock election with respect to such stockholder’s shares of Terminix common stock.
The consideration to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, to automatic adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132
to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued
in the transaction equals the aggregate amount agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed
illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and
Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135. No fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs will
be issued in the transaction, and Terminix stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional
Rentokil Initial ADSs. An election will have been properly made only if the designated exchange agent
has received a properly completed form of election at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on
the date that is three business days preceding the closing date. Terminix and Rentokil

Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022, assuming the merger proposal is
approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other conditions to closing (described
under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to
Completion of the Transaction” beginning on page 141) are satisfied (including approval of the
Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial shareholders on October 6, 2022). In
connection with the anticipated completion of the transaction, the anticipated election deadline for
Terminix stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration they desire to receive in the transaction
has been set for 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6, 2022.
Will I receive the form of merger consideration that I request on the form of election?
Not necessarily. The aggregate amount of cash and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be paid
and issued, respectively, to Terminix stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement will not vary as a
result of individual election preferences. If there is an oversubscription of the aggregate amount of cash
available to be paid by Rentokil Initial to Terminix stockholders due to the elections of Terminix
stockholders, the aggregate amount of cash payable by Rentokil Initial in the transaction will not be
increased. Similarly, if there is an oversubscription of the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to
be issued by Rentokil Initial to Terminix stockholders due to the elections of Terminix stockholders (or
failures to make an election), the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued by Rentokil
Initial in the transaction will not be increased. Rather, in either such case, the exchange agent will
allocate between cash and Rentokil Initial ADSs in accordance with the proration mechanics described
in “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and
the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued in the transaction equals the aggregate amount
agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of
the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations”
beginning on page 135.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that each Terminix stockholder that has made a valid election to
receive cash consideration or stock consideration will receive the form of consideration elected with
respect to the shares of Terminix common stock held by such stockholder.
For additional information, see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Proposal - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 74 and “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of
Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135.
Will the value of the merger consideration I receive vary depending on whether I make the stock election or cash
election?
The value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of
the measurement day will be substantially the same. If the price of Rentokil Initial ADSs upon the close
of the transaction equals the Rentokil Initial ADS price (measured using the volume weighted average
price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as of the measurement day multiplied by five), the value at
transaction close of the merger consideration you receive will be the same, regardless of whether you
make the stock election or cash election. Because the price of Rentokil Initial ADSs upon the close of
the transaction may be higher or lower than the Rentokil Initial ADS price (measured using the volume
weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as of the measurement day multiplied by five),
the value at transaction close of the merger consideration you receive may vary, depending on whether
you make the stock election or cash election. The Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued in connection with
the transaction will be listed on the NYSE.
What is the deadline for making an election?
Your election, to be properly made, must be received by the exchange agent at its designated office by
the election deadline, which is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is three business days preceding
the closing date. Terminix and Rentokil Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022,
assuming the merger proposal is approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other
conditions to closing (described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Transaction” beginning on page 141) are

satisfied (including approval of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial
shareholders on October 6, 2022). In connection with the anticipated completion of the transaction, the
anticipated election deadline for Terminix stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration they
desire to receive in the transaction has been set for 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6, 2022.
Can Terminix stockholders revoke their election for cash consideration or stock consideration (which we refer
to as a “cash/stock election”) after submitting their initial cash/stock election?
Yes. Any record holder of Terminix common stock who has delivered a duly completed election form to
the exchange agent may, at any time prior to the election deadline, revoke such holder’s cash/stock
election only by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline.
What happens if I do not send a form of election or it is not received by the election deadline?
If the exchange agent does not receive a properly completed form of election from you at or prior to the
election deadline, then you will be deemed to have elected to receive stock consideration with respect
to your shares of Terminix common stock. You bear the risk of delivery of the form of election to the
exchange agent.
Can Terminix stockholders transfer their shares after submitting an initial cash/stock election?
Terminix stockholders of record who have made a cash/stock election will be unable to sell or otherwise
transfer their shares of Terminix common stock after making such election, unless the cash/stock
election is properly revoked before such election deadline in accordance with the election procedures or
unless the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.
How does the Terminix board of directors recommend that I vote at the Terminix special meeting?
The Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal and
“FOR” the compensation proposal.
In considering the recommendations of the Terminix board of directors, Terminix stockholders should be
aware that Terminix directors and executive officers may have interests in the transaction that are
different from, or in addition to, their interests as Terminix stockholders. These interests may include,
among others, the treatment of outstanding Terminix equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement,
the payment of severance benefits and acceleration of outstanding Terminix equity awards upon certain
terminations of employment, and the combined company’s agreement to indemnify Terminix directors
and executive officers against certain claims and liabilities. For a more complete description of these
interests, see the information provided in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction”
beginning on page 105.
How do Terminix’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
Terminix currently expects that Terminix’s directors and executive officers eligible to vote on the
proposals brought before the Terminix special meeting will vote their Terminix common stock “FOR” the
merger proposal and “FOR” the compensation proposal.
Who is entitled to vote at the Terminix special meeting?
All holders of record of shares of Terminix common stock who held shares at the close of business on
September 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the “record date”), are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote
at, the Terminix special meeting. Each such holder of Terminix common stock is entitled to cast one vote
on each matter properly brought before the Terminix special meeting for each share of Terminix common
stock that such holder owned of record as of the record date. Attendance at the Terminix special
meeting is not required to vote. See below and the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“The Terminix Special Meeting - Methods of Voting” beginning on page 68 for instructions on how to
vote your shares without attending the Terminix special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What is a proxy?
A proxy is a stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such
stockholder on their behalf. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Terminix
common stock is referred to as a “proxy card.”
How many votes do I have for the Terminix special meeting?
Each Terminix stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Terminix common stock held of record
as of the close of business on the record date. As of the close of business on the record date, there
were 121,606,696 outstanding shares of Terminix common stock.
What constitutes a quorum for the Terminix special meeting?
A quorum means the presence in person (including virtually via the Internet) or by proxy of the holders
of record of a majority of the Terminix common stock entitled to vote at the Terminix special meeting.
What happens if the transaction is not completed?
If the merger proposal is not approved by Terminix stockholders, or if the transaction is not completed
for any other reason, Terminix stockholders will not receive the merger consideration or any other
consideration in connection with the transaction, and their shares of Terminix common stock will remain
outstanding.
If the transaction is not completed, Terminix will remain an independent public company and the
Terminix common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol “TMX.”
If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Terminix may be required to pay
Rentokil Initial by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million. If the merger agreement
is terminated under other specified circumstances, Rentokil Initial may be required to pay Terminix by
way of compensation a termination payment of $150 million. In addition, either party may be required to
pay to the other party by way of compensation a payment of $50 million if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain specified circumstances. See the section of this proxy statement/​prospectus
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 160 for a
more detailed discussion of the termination payments.
What stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the Terminix special meeting? What will
happen if I fail to vote or abstain from voting on each proposal at the Terminix special meeting?
Proposal 1: Merger Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Terminix special meeting, approval
of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote. Accordingly, a Terminix stockholder’s
abstention from voting or the failure of any Terminix stockholder to vote (including the failure of a
Terminix stockholder who holds their shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee
to give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the merger proposal),
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Proposal 2: Compensation Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Terminix special meeting,
approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
in voting power of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock present in person (including
virtually via the Internet) or represented by proxy at the Terminix special meeting and entitled to vote.
Accordingly, a broker non-vote or a Terminix stockholder’s failure to return or submit a proxy and to
attend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on the compensation proposal (assuming a
quorum is present), but the failure of any shares present or represented at the Terminix special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
compensation proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-
related compensation for Terminix’s named executive officers (i.e., the compensation proposal)?
Under SEC rules, Terminix is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote of its stockholders with
respect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Terminix’s named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the transaction.
What happens if Terminix stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related
compensation for Terminix’s named executive officers (i.e., the compensation proposal)?
Because the vote to approve the compensation proposal is advisory in nature, the outcome of the vote
will not be binding upon Terminix or the combined company and the completion of the transaction is not
conditioned or dependent upon the approval of the compensation proposal. Accordingly, the merger-
related compensation, which is described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction”
beginning on page 105 of this proxy statement/prospectus, may be paid to Terminix’s named executive
officers even if Terminix’s stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal.
How can I vote my shares at the Terminix special meeting?
Shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record of Terminix may be voted during the
Terminix special meeting via the special meeting website. If you choose to vote your shares during the
virtual meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card in order to access
the special meeting website and to vote as described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “The Terminix Special Meeting - Attending the Terminix Special Meeting” beginning on page
70.
Shares held in “street name” may be voted via the special meeting website only if you obtain a specific
control number and follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. See the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Terminix Special Meeting - Attending the
Terminix Special Meeting” beginning on page 70.
Even if you plan to attend the Terminix special meeting, Terminix recommends that you vote your shares
in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or become
unable to attend the Terminix special meeting.
Additional information on attending the Terminix special meeting can be found under the section of this
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Terminix Special Meeting” beginning on page 66.
How can I vote my shares without attending the Terminix special meeting?
Whether you hold your shares directly as the stockholder of record of Terminix or beneficially in “street
name,” you may direct your vote by proxy without attending the Terminix special meeting via the special
meeting website. If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, or by
telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. Please note that
if you hold shares beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by
your bank, broker or other nominee.
Additional information on voting procedures can be found under the section of this proxy statement/​
prospectus entitled “The Terminix Special Meeting” beginning on page 66.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares held
in “street name?”
If your shares of common stock in Terminix are registered directly in your name with Computershare
Trust Company N.A., the transfer agent for Terminix, you are considered the stockholder of record with
respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote your shares directly at
the Terminix special meeting. You may also grant a proxy for your vote directly to Terminix or to a third
party to vote your shares at the Terminix special meeting.
If your shares of common stock in Terminix are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are
considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name.” Your bank, broker or other nominee

will send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedures for voting your shares and
you must instruct the bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote them by following the instructions
that the bank, broker or other nominee provides to you with these proxy materials. Most banks, brokers
and other nominees offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by
completing a voting instruction card, by telephone, and by the Internet.
If my shares of Terminix common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my
bank, broker or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me?
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Terminix common
stock if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares. Under the NYSE
rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of Terminix common stock in “street name”
for their customers have authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received
instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are prohibited from
exercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters, which include all the proposals
currently scheduled to be considered and voted on at the Terminix special meeting. As a result, absent
specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokers and other nominees are
not empowered to vote such shares.
Since there are no items on the agenda that your broker has discretionary authority to vote upon, broker
non-votes will not be counted as present at the Terminix special meeting for the purposes of
determining a quorum if you fail to instruct your broker on how to vote on the proposals. Therefore, a
broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. If you fail to
submit any instruction to your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have no effect on the compensation
proposal, assuming that a quorum is otherwise present.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Terminix special meeting?
If you hold shares of Terminix common stock in “street name” and also directly in your name as a
stockholder of record or otherwise, or if you hold shares of Terminix common stock in more than one
brokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the Terminix
special meeting.
Record Holders. For shares held directly, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card (or cast
your vote by telephone or via the Internet as provided on each proxy card) or otherwise follow the
voting instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to ensure that all of your
shares of Terminix common stock are voted.
Shares in “street name.” For shares held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to make sure that you
vote all of your shares.
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Terminix common stock voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares of Terminix common stock in the way that you indicate. For each proposal to be voted
on at the Terminix special meeting, you may specify whether your shares of Terminix common stock
should be voted for or against, or abstain from voting.
How will my shares of Terminix common stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?
If you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of Terminix
common stock to be voted, then your shares of Terminix common stock will be voted in accordance with
the recommendation of the Terminix board of directors: “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the
compensation proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?
Any Terminix stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke the proxy and change their vote before
the proxy is voted at the Terminix special meeting by doing any of the following:

for the Terminix special meeting that is received by the deadline specified on the accompanying proxy
card;
giving written notice of your revocation to Terminix’s Corporate Secretary; or
revoking your proxy and voting at the Terminix special meeting.
Execution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to attend the Terminix special
meeting and vote thereat. Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the
revocation of proxies should be addressed to:
Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.

Attn: Corporate Secretary
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Terminix Special
Meeting - Revocability of Proxies” beginning on page 69.
If I hold my shares in “street name,” can I change my voting instructions after I have submitted voting
instructions to my bank, broker or other nominee?
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you previously provided
voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions.
What is a “broker non-vote”?
Under the NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote
“uninstructed” shares (i.e., shares of record held by banks, brokers or other nominees, but with respect
to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how to vote on a
particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to
“non-routine” matters. All of the proposals currently expected to be brought before the Terminix special
meeting are “non-routine” matters under the NYSE rules.
A “broker non-vote” occurs on an item when (1) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary
authority to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not
permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and
(2) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with such instructions.
Because all of the proposals currently expected to be voted on at the Terminix special meeting are non-
routine matters under the NYSE rules for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote,
Terminix does not expect there to be any broker non-votes at the Terminix special meeting.
Where can I find the voting results of the Terminix special meeting?
The preliminary voting results for the Terminix special meeting are expected to be announced at the
Terminix special meeting. In addition, within four business days following the Terminix special meeting,
Terminix will file the final voting results of the Terminix special meeting (or, if the final voting results
have not yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Do Terminix stockholders have dissenters’ or appraisal rights?
Yes. If you want to exercise appraisal rights and receive the fair value of shares of Terminix common
stock in cash instead of the merger consideration, then you must file a written objection with Terminix
prior to the Terminix special meeting stating, among other things, that you will exercise your right to
dissent if the transaction is completed. Also, you may not vote in favor of the merger proposal and must
follow other procedures, both before and after the Terminix special meeting, as described in Annex C to
this proxy statement/prospectus. Note that if you return a signed proxy card without voting instructions
or with instructions to vote “FOR” the merger proposal, then your shares will automatically be voted

in favor of the merger proposal and you will lose all appraisal rights available under Delaware law. A
summary of these provisions can be found under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Shares Subject to Properly Exercised Appraisal Rights” beginning
on page 139. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, Terminix
stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel. Failure to strictly comply with the applicable Delaware law provisions will result in the loss of
the right of appraisal.
Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the merger proposal?
Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section of this proxy
statement/​prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 37. You also should read and carefully
consider the risk factors with respect to Terminix that are contained in the documents that are
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
What happens if I sell my shares of Terminix common stock after the record date but before the Terminix special
meeting?
The record date is earlier than the date of the Terminix special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer
your shares of Terminix common stock after the record date but before the Terminix special meeting, you
will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Terminix special meeting.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
Terminix has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated (which we refer to as “Innisfree”) to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the Terminix special meeting. Terminix estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee
of approximately $25,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Terminix has
agreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its
solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
Terminix also may be required to reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial
owners of Terminix common stock. Terminix’s directors, officers and employees and Rentokil Initial’s
directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in
person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
When is the transaction expected to be completed?
Terminix and Rentokil Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022, assuming the
merger proposal is approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other conditions to
closing (described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Transaction” beginning on page 141) are satisfied (
including approval of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial shareholders
on October 6, 2022). However, neither Terminix nor Rentokil Initial can predict the actual date on which
the transaction will be completed, or if the transaction will be completed at all, because completion of
the transaction is subject to conditions and factors outside the control of both companies. The merger
agreement contains an end date of December 31, 2022, for the completion of the transaction, which may
be extended to March 13, 2023 by either Terminix or Rentokil Initial in certain circumstances, which we
refer to as the “end date.” See also the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Proposal -  Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction” beginning on page 112.
Is the completion of the transaction subject to any conditions?
Yes. Rentokil Initial and Terminix are not required to complete the transaction unless certain conditions
are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived). These conditions include, among
others, the adoption of the merger agreement by Terminix stockholders and the approval by Rentokil
Initial shareholders of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals. For a more complete summary of
the conditions that must be satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived) prior to

completion of the transaction, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Transaction” beginning on page 141.
What equity stake will Terminix stockholders hold in Rentokil Initial immediately following the transaction?
Based on the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock
outstanding on August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, former Terminix
stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction are expected to own Rentokil Initial
ADSs representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, and
Rentokil Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction are expected to own approximately
74.3% of the outstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. The relative ownership interests of Rentokil
Initial shareholders and former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the
transaction in Rentokil Initial immediately following the transaction will depend on the number of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the transaction.
If I am a Terminix stockholder, how will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?
As a holder of Terminix common stock in book-entry form, whether through DTC or otherwise, you will
not be required to take any specific actions to exchange your shares for the merger consideration. Your
Terminix shares will, following the effective time of the first merger, be automatically exchanged for any
Rentokil Initial ADSs (in book-entry form) and/or cash (including any cash in lieu of any fractional
Rentokil Initial ADSs) to which you are entitled. More information may be found in the sections of this
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” and “The
Merger Agreement - No Fractional ADSs” beginning on pages 132 and 138, respectively.
Will the Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued to me at the completion of the transaction be publicly traded on an
exchange?
Yes. It is a condition to the completion of the transaction that the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares represented thereby) to be issued in connection with the transaction be approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. In addition, it is a condition that Rentokil
Initial receive acknowledgement by the FCA of the approval of the application for the admission of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by the Rentokil Initial ADSs to the premium listing segment
of the FCA’s official list, and acknowledgement by the LSE of the admission to trading of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares represented by the Rentokil Initial ADSs on the LSE’s main market for listed securities.
Therefore, at the first effective time, all Rentokil Initial ADSs received by Terminix stockholders in
connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE (and are expected to trade under the symbol
“RTO”) and may be traded on the exchange by stockholders.
Rentokil Initial ADSs received by Terminix stockholders in connection with the transaction will be freely
transferable, except for Rentokil Initial ADSs issued to any stockholder deemed to be an “affiliate” of
Rentokil Initial for purposes of U.S. federal securities law. For more information, see the section entitled
“The Merger Proposal - Restrictions on Resales of Rentokil Initial ADSs Received in the Transaction”
beginning on page 119.
Can I elect to receive Rentokil Initial ordinary shares instead of Rentokil Initial ADSs?
No. Terminix stockholders may not elect to receive Rentokil Initial ordinary shares in lieu of any Rentokil
Initial ADSs to which they are entitled in connection with the transaction. However, if Rentokil Initial
ADSs are issued to you, you will have the right, following the closing, to exchange those Rentokil Initial
ADSs for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, subject to the payment of any fees charged by the depositary
bank relating to such exchange of Rentokil Initial ADSs for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and any
applicable taxes and compliance with the other procedures set forth in the deposit agreement.
For a more detailed discussion about the exchange of Rentokil Initial ADSs for Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Description of Rentokil Initial
American Depositary Shares” beginning on page 193.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
How will Rentokil Initial shareholders be affected by the transaction?
Upon completion of the transaction, each Rentokil Initial shareholder will hold the same number of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares that such stockholder held immediately prior to completion of the
transaction. As a result of the transaction, Rentokil Initial shareholders will own shares in a larger
consolidated company with more assets. However, because in connection with the transaction Rentokil
Initial will be issuing Rentokil Initial ADSs to Terminix stockholders in exchange for their shares of
Terminix common stock, each outstanding share of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as of immediately
prior to the transaction will represent a smaller percentage of the aggregate number of shares of Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares outstanding after the transaction.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction?
The obligation of Terminix to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion
from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Terminix, or Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to
Rentokil Initial, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the first merger and the second merger, taken
together as an integrated transaction, will qualify (A) as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (B) for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code.
Accordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction qualifies as a reorganization and that the

Accordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction qualifies as a reorganization and that the
general rule of Section 367(a)(1) does not apply, and assuming that, in the case of any holder who would
be treated as a “five-percent transferee shareholder”  (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Rentokil Initial following the transaction, such holder enters into a five-
year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8:
a U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock solely for Rentokil Initial ADSs in the
transaction will generally not recognize any gain or loss, except with respect to cash received in lieu
of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs;
a U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock solely for cash in the transaction will
generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Terminix common stock; and
a U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock for a combination of Rentokil Initial
ADSs and cash in the transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to
the lesser of: (i) the cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs, if any)
received by such U.S. Holder in the transaction; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the cash (excluding
cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs, if any) plus the fair market value of the
Rentokil Initial ADSs (including any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs deemed received) received by
such U.S. Holder in exchange for its shares of Terminix common stock in the transaction, over (b)
such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock exchanged.
In addition, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to any cash received in lieu
of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs.
A Non-U.S. Holder exchanging its shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the transaction.
For definitions of “U.S. Holder” and “Non-U.S. Holder” and a more detailed discussion of the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders, see the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 121.
The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Terminix
common stock. A Terminix stockholder’s tax consequences will depend on his, her or its individual
situation. Accordingly, each Terminix stockholder is urged to consult his, her or its tax advisors for a full
understanding of the particular tax consequences of the transaction to such stockholder.

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Risk Factors Summary,"Risk Factors Summary (page 22)
Below is a summary of the principal risk factors that you should consider in deciding how to vote for the
proposals presented in this proxy statement/prospectus. The below summary is qualified in its entirety by
the more complete discussion of such risks and uncertainties that follows this summary.
Risks Relating to the Transaction
Because the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may fluctuate and the exchange ratio and
per share cash amount are both fixed, Terminix stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the
merger consideration that they will receive in the transaction.
Certain Terminix stockholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what
they elect.
If you make a cash/stock election, you will not be able to sell those shares unless you revoke your
election prior to the election deadline.
The market price for Rentokil Initial ADSs may be affected by different factors from those that
historically have affected the market price of Terminix common stock.
There is no assurance when or if the transaction will be completed.
Certain Terminix agreements may contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions that may be
triggered by the transaction and that, if acted upon or not waived, could cause the combined
company to lose the benefit of such agreement(s) and incur liabilities or replacement costs, which
could have an adverse effect on the combined company.
The combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.
Because Rentokil Initial is a holding company and substantially all of its operations will be conducted
through its subsidiaries, its ability to pay dividends on the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares depends
on its ability to obtain cash dividends or other cash payments or to obtain loans from such entities.
The announcement and pendency of the transaction could adversely affect each of Terminix’s and
Rentokil Initial’s respective businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Terminix and Rentokil Initial will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the
transaction.
The transaction may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Rentokil Initial’s earnings per share,
which may negatively affect the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value
of the Rentokil Initial ADSs following the transaction.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Terminix and Rentokil Initial is
presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations or
financial condition of the combined company following the transaction.
Rentokil Initial or Terminix may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting
shareholder approval or stockholder approval, respectively.
The opinion of Terminix’s financial advisor rendered to Terminix’s board of directors does not reflect
changes in circumstances between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the
transaction.
While the merger agreement is in effect, Terminix, Rentokil Initial and their respective subsidiaries’
businesses are subject to restrictions on their business activities.
The termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact Terminix.
Directors and executive officers of Terminix have interests in the transaction that may differ from the
interests of Terminix stockholders generally, including, if the transaction is completed, the receipt of
financial and other benefits.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Except in specified circumstances, if the transaction is not completed by December 31, 2022, subject
to extension in specified circumstances by either Terminix or Rentokil Initial, either Terminix or
Rentokil Initial may choose not to proceed with the transaction.
Following the closing, there may be less publicly available information concerning Rentokil Initial
than there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because, as a foreign private issuer,
Rentokil Initial would be exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and would be
permitted to file less information with the SEC than issuers that are not foreign private issuers and
Rentokil Initial, as a foreign private issuer, would be permitted to follow home country practice in lieu
of the listing requirements of NYSE, subject to certain exceptions.
Rentokil Initial is organized under the laws of England and Wales and a substantial portion of its
assets are, and many of its directors and officers reside, outside of the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the
United States against Rentokil Initial or Rentokil Initial’s officers and members of the Rentokil Initial
board of directors.
Resales of Rentokil Initial ADSs following the transaction may cause the market value of Rentokil
Initial ADSs to decline.
An active trading market for Rentokil Initial ADSs may not develop, which would adversely affect the
liquidity and price of Rentokil Initial ADSs.
The Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares have different rights from the shares of
Terminix common stock.
Current Rentokil Initial shareholders and Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in
the transaction will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction.
Terminix is, and Rentokil Initial may become, the target of securities class actions and derivative
lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the transaction from being
completed.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect
on the combined company’s business and operations.
The transaction may affect the application of new or existing tax rules to the combined company,
which could result in a material impact on the combined company’s cash tax liabilities and tax charges.
Prior to the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial and Terminix (and with effect from the
completion of the transaction, the combined company) may have difficulty attracting, motivating and
retaining executives and other employees in light of the transaction.
The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Rentokil Initial and Terminix
to pursue alternatives to the transaction and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire
Terminix for greater consideration than Rentokil Initial has agreed to pay.
The financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.
Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign currency value of Rentokil Initial ADSs
and any dividends.
Risks Related to Rentokil Initial’s Business
Risks Relating to Business Strategies and Operations
If Rentokil Initial is unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions (including the transaction) or if its
disposals result in unexpected costs or liabilities, its business could be materially and adversely
affected.
Rentokil Initial may experience difficulties integrating, streamlining and optimizing its IT systems,
processes and technologies.
Rentokil Initial depends on a suitably skilled and qualified labor force to maintain the business.
Rentokil Initial depends on key personnel to lead Rentokil Initial’s business.

adverse effect on its business.

The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, at the first effective time, (1) Merger Sub I, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, will merge
with and into Terminix with Terminix surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, and (2) immediately
thereafter Terminix will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving
company as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco and therefore an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Rentokil Initial. As a result, Terminix will cease to be a publicly traded company. The terms and conditions of
the transaction are contained in the merger agreement, which is described in this proxy statement/prospectus
and attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read the merger
agreement carefully, as it is the legal document that governs the transaction. All descriptions in this summary

Terminix retained Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (which is referred to as “Lazard”), to act as financial advisor to the
Terminix board of directors in connection with the transaction. In connection with this engagement, the
Terminix board of directors requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Terminix common stock (other than holders of certain excluded shares as described in the merger
agreement) of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders in the transaction.
On December 13, 2021, Lazard rendered an oral opinion to the Terminix board of directors, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated December 13, 2021, to the effect that, as of
the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in Lazard’s written opinion, the merger consideration
to be paid to holders of Terminix common stock (other than holders of certain excluded shares as described
in the merger agreement) in the transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The Terminix special meeting will be held virtually via the Internet on October 6, 2022, beginning at 8:30 a.m.,
Eastern Time. Terminix has elected to hold the Terminix special meeting solely by means of remote
communication via the Internet. The Terminix special meeting will be held solely via live webcast and there
will not be a physical meeting location. Terminix stockholders will be able to attend the Terminix special
meeting online and vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TMX2022SM (which we refer to as the “special meeting website”).
The purposes of the Terminix special meeting are as follows:
Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement. To consider and vote on the merger proposal; and
Proposal 2: Approval, on an Advisory (Non-Binding) Basis, of Certain Merger-Related
Compensatory Arrangements with Terminix’s Named Executive Officers. To consider and vote on the
compensation proposal.
Completion of the transaction is conditioned on the approval of the merger proposal by Terminix’s
stockholders. The approval of the compensation proposal is not a condition to the obligation of either
Terminix or Rentokil Initial to complete the transaction.
Only holders of record of shares of Terminix common stock outstanding as of the close of business on
September 6, 2022, the record date for the Terminix special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the Terminix special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Terminix special meeting. Terminix
stockholders may cast one vote for each share of Terminix common stock that Terminix stockholders own of
record as of that record date.
A quorum of Terminix stockholders is necessary to hold the Terminix special meeting. A quorum will exist at
the Terminix special meeting upon the presence in person (including virtually via the Internet) or by proxy of
the holders of record of a majority of the Terminix common stock entitled to vote at the Terminix special
meeting. All shares of Terminix common stock represented by a valid proxy and all abstentions will be
counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. All of the proposals for consideration at the
Terminix special meeting are considered “non-routine” matters under the NYSE rules, and, therefore, brokers
are not permitted to vote on any of the matters to be considered at the Terminix special meeting unless they
have received instructions from the beneficial owners. As a result, no “broker non-votes” are expected at the
meeting, and shares held in “street name” will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining the
existence of a quorum unless the stockholder provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting
instructions for at least one of the proposals brought before the Terminix special meeting.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Terminix special meeting, approval of the merger proposal requires the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote on
the proposal. Shares of Terminix common stock not present at the Terminix special meeting, shares that are
present and not voted on the merger proposal, including due to the failure of any

give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the merger proposal, and
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Terminix special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of
Terminix common stock present in person (including virtually via the Internet) or represented by proxy at the
Terminix special meeting and entitled to vote. Accordingly, a broker non-vote or a Terminix stockholder’s
failure to return or submit a proxy and to attend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on the
compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present), but the failure of any shares present or represented
at the Terminix special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal to vote will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the compensation proposal.",41,42

The completion of the transaction is conditioned upon the approval for listing on the NYSE of Rentokil
Initial ADSs issuable pursuant to the merger agreement, subject to official notice of issuance. In addition, it
is a requirement that Rentokil Initial receive acknowledgement by the FCA and LSE that the Rentokil Initial

The obligation of Terminix to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Terminix, or Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to Rentokil
Initial, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions
set forth or referred to in such opinion, the first merger and the second merger, taken together as an
integrated transaction, will qualify (A) as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and (B) for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code.
Accordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction qualifies as a reorganization and that the
general rule of Section 367(a)(1) does not apply, and assuming that, in the case of any holder who would be
treated as a “five-percent transferee shareholder”  (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Rentokil Initial following the transaction, such holder enters into a five-year gain
recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8:
a U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock solely for Rentokil Initial ADSs in the
transaction will generally not recognize any gain or loss, except with respect to cash received in lieu
of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs;
a U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock solely for cash in the transaction
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Terminix common stock; and
a U.S. Holder that exchanges shares of Terminix common stock for a combination of Rentokil Initial
ADSs and cash in the transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to
the lesser of: (i) the cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs, if any)
received by such U.S. Holder in the transaction; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the cash
(excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs, if any) plus the fair market value of
the Rentokil Initial ADSs (including any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs deemed received) received by
such U.S. Holder in exchange for its shares of Terminix common stock in the transaction, over (b)
such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock exchanged.

In addition, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to any cash received in lieu of
fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs.
A Non-U.S. Holder exchanging its shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the transaction.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Terminix common
stock. A Terminix stockholder’s tax consequences will depend on his, her or its individual situation.
Accordingly, each Terminix stockholder is urged to consult his, her or its tax advisors for a full
understanding of the particular tax consequences of the transaction to such stockholder.
Material UK Tax Consequences of Owning Rentokil Initial Ordinary Shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs (page 127)
Taxation of Disposals of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs
Holders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs who are not resident in the UK should not
generally be subject to UK taxation of capital gains on the disposal or deemed disposal of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs unless they are carrying on a trade, profession or vocation in the
UK through a permanent establishment, branch or agency there in connection with which the Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs are used, held or acquired.
An individual holder of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs who has been resident for tax
purposes in the UK but who ceases to be so resident or becomes treated as resident outside the UK for the
purposes of a double tax treaty for a period of five years or less and who disposes of all or part of their
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs during that period may be liable to capital gains tax
on their return to the UK, subject to any available exemptions or reliefs.
Taxation of Dividends received from Rentokil Initial
Rentokil Initial is not required to withhold UK tax when paying a dividend. Holders of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs resident outside the UK should generally not be subject to UK
taxation on dividend income unless they are carrying on a trade, profession or vocation through a permanent
establishment, branch or agency in the UK and the dividends are either a receipt of that trade, profession or
vocation (or, in the case of a corporate holder, the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs are
used by, or held by or for, that UK permanent establishment).
UK Stamp Duty and SDRT
Terminix stockholders should not be liable to pay any UK stamp duty or SDRT in respect of the issuance of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs pursuant to the transaction.
UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% (rounded up to the next multiple of £5) of the amount or value of the
consideration given is generally payable on a physical instrument transferring Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares. Paperless transfers of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, such as those occurring within CREST, are
generally liable to SDRT, rather than UK stamp duty, at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the
consideration. CREST is obliged to collect SDRT on relevant transactions settled within the system. The
charge is generally borne by the purchaser.
Subsequent transfers of Rentokil Initial ADSs should not attract a charge to UK stamp duty provided there is
no written instrument of transfer and paperless transfers of Rentokil Initial ADSs held by DTC should not
incur an SDRT charge.

Terminix Stock Options
At the first effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Terminix common stock (each, a
“Terminix Stock Option”) that is then vested and exercisable will be cancelled in consideration for the right to
receive, within 10 business days following the first effective time, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the excess of (1) the Vested Award Consideration, over (2) the exercise price per share of Terminix common
stock subject to such Terminix Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Terminix common stock subject
to such Terminix Stock Option immediately prior to the first effective time, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of this proxy statement/prospectus, “Vested Award
Consideration” means the sum of (A) the per share cash amount and (B) the product of the exchange ratio
and the Rentokil Initial ADS price.
All other Terminix Stock Options outstanding at the first effective time will at that time be assumed by
Rentokil Initial and converted into a stock option award (each an “Assumed Option”) to purchase a number
of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the number of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix
Stock Option multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
Rentokil Initial ADSs. The exercise price per Rentokil Initial ADS applicable to each Assumed Option will be
equal to the exercise price per share of Terminix common stock applicable to such Terminix Stock Option
divided by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Assumed Option
will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Terminix Stock Option, including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a qualifying
termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger. For purposes of this
proxy, “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means the sum, rounded to four decimal places, equal to (i) the
exchange ratio, plus (ii) the quotient of (A) the per share cash amount, and (B) the Rentokil Initial ADS price.
Terminix Restricted Stock Unit Awards
At the first effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Terminix
common stock that vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a “Terminix RSU Award”) that is vested
as of the first effective time will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, within 10 business
days following the first effective time, the Vested Award Consideration, without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes.

common stock that vests based on the achievement of a combination of time- and performance-based
vesting conditions (each, a “Terminix PSU Award”) that was granted prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and converted into a restricted unit award (each an “Assumed
PSU Award”) that settles, subject to the achievement of the applicable time-based vesting conditions, in a
number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Terminix common stock
underlying the Terminix PSU Award (determined by deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved
at the greater of the target level and the actual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior
to the first effective time), multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares. Each such Assumed PSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix PSU Award, other than any
performance-based vested conditions, including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on
a qualifying termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger.
Each Terminix PSU Award granted after the date of the Merger Agreement (under circumstances permitted by
the Merger Agreement) will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and converted into an Assumed PSU Award that
settles, subject to the achievement of the applicable time and performance-based vesting conditions, in a
target number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Terminix common
stock underlying the Terminix PSU Award (determined by assuming the applicable performance goals to be
achieved at target level) multiplied by (2) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares. Each such Assumed PSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix PSU Award, including any terms and
conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a qualifying termination of the holder’s employment in

respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period.
Each of Rentokil Initial and Terminix filed its respective HSR Act notification and report forms with respect to
the transaction on January 10, 2022. Following informal discussions with the FTC staff, Rentokil Initial
notified the FTC that it elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form under the HSR Act prior
to expiration of the initial waiting period to give the FTC additional time to review the transaction. Rentokil
Initial’s notification and report form was withdrawn effective as of February 9, 2022, and Rentokil Initial
refiled its notification on February 11, 2022, commencing a new 30-calendar-day waiting period under the

things, that Bruce would suffer irreparable harm from purported competition with Rentokil Initial should the
transaction be consummated, and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from
merging with Rentokil Initial so long as Rentokil Initial owns pest control companies with locations within
Bruce’s service area and from disclosing to Rentokil Initial certain confidential or proprietary information of
the Company. On August 1, 2022, the court denied Bruce’s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the
transaction. Terminix believes that the claims asserted in the Bruce Lawsuit are without merit.
In connection with the transaction, three complaints have been filed by purported Terminix stockholders
against Terminix and its directors, and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. The complaints are
captioned Ferreiro v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-04987 (S.D.N.Y.); Justice v. Terminix
Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-05519 (S.D.N.Y.); and Baker v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et
al., No. 1:22-cv-05524 (S.D.N.Y.). The draft complaint is captioned Paxton v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.,
et al. and does not specify any court. The complaints and draft complaint generally allege that the
preliminary registration statement filed with the SEC on June 7, 2022 omitted certain allegedly material
information in connection with the transaction in violation of federal proxy laws, and one of the complaints
further alleges that the Terminix directors further breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the
transaction and that Terminix aided and abetted that breach. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including:
enjoining the consummation of the transaction; rescission of the transaction, or rescissory damages in the
event the transaction is consummated without the allegedly material disclosures; declaring the merger
agreement unenforceable; directing dissemination of additional allegedly material disclosures; declaring that
Terminix and its directors violated federal proxy laws; awarding plaintiffs costs and an allowance for

If the transaction is completed, Terminix stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and who otherwise comply with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be
entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder and obtain payment in cash for the fair value of their shares
of Terminix, subject to certain limitations under the DGCL. Any shares of Terminix common stock held by a
Terminix stockholder on the date of making an appraisal demand, who continues to own such shares through
the first effective date, who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who has
demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL will have the right to obtain payment in
cash for the fair value of their shares of Terminix in lieu of the merger consideration, unless such Terminix
stockholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such stockholder’s appraisal
rights under the DGCL. If, after the completion of the transaction, such holder of Terminix common stock fails
to perfect, effectively withdraws, waives or otherwise loses his, her or its appraisal rights, each such share
will be treated as if it had been converted as of the completion of the transaction into a right to receive the
merger consideration. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising your appraisal rights, Terminix
stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel.
Failure to strictly comply with these provisions will result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section
entitled “The Merger Proposal - Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights” contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus for additional information and the text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is included
as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus, which you are encouraged to read carefully and in their

In order to provide financing certainty for the transaction, Rentokil Initial obtained bridge and term facility
commitments having an original aggregate principal amount of $2,700 million consisting of (i) “Facility A”, a
bridge facility having an original aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million, which has since been
terminated in full as described below and (ii) “Facility B”, a term facility having an original aggregate
principal amount of $700 million, provided by a syndicate of banks.
On June 30, 2022, Facility A was cancelled in full following the issuances on June 27, 2022 by Rentokil Initial
and its subsidiary of (i) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2027 in an aggregate principal amount of €850
million, (ii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2030 in an aggregate principal amount of €600 million and
(iii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2032 in an aggregate principal amount of £400 million, in each case
pursuant to Rentokil Initial’s Euro Medium Term Note Programme (collectively, the “New Senior Notes”). The
New Senior Notes contain customary undertakings, mandatory redemption events and a negative pledge
given by the relevant issuer and Rentokil Initial (as guarantor). There are no financial performance
maintenance covenants and (except for the negative pledge) no other negative covenants. The proceeds of
the New Senior Notes have been converted to $2,000 million using hedging instruments.
Facility B will mature on the third anniversary of the date of utilization. Facility B includes customary
representations and warranties, undertakings and mandatory prepayment events. There are no financial
performance maintenance covenants.

The merger agreement generally restricts Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s ability to: (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries
regarding, or the making or submission of, any “acquisition proposal”  (as defined in the merger agreement
and described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation”), (ii) (A) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party, (B)

commitment or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or non-binding) with respect to an
acquisition proposal.
However, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as
applicable, is permitted to furnish information with respect to it and its subsidiaries to third parties and
participate in discussions or negotiations with such third parties in response to unsolicited acquisition
proposals if, prior to taking such action, such party’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that based on the information then available,
such acquisition proposal either constitutes a “superior proposal”  (as defined in the merger agreement and
described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - No

Upon the completion of the transaction, each eligible share of Terminix common stock will be converted into
the right to receive the merger consideration. As a result, Terminix stockholders may receive Rentokil Initial
ADSs and, in such case, will have different rights once they become Rentokil Initial shareholders (whether
directly or via their holding of Rentokil Initial ADSs) due to differences between the organizational
documents of Terminix and Rentokil Initial and differences between laws of the State of Delaware, where
Terminix is incorporated, and the laws of England and Wales, where Rentokil Initial is incorporated. For a
summary of the material differences between the rights of Rentokil Initial shareholders and the existing rights

You should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information set forth in and
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, before making a decision on the merger
proposal or the compensation proposal. In the event you become a holder of Rentokil Initial ADSs following
completion of the transaction, you will be subject to all risks inherent in the business of Rentokil Initial in
addition to the risks relating to Terminix. The market value of your Rentokil Initial ADSs will reflect the
performance of the business relative to, among other things, that of the competitors of Rentokil Initial and
Terminix and general economic, market and industry conditions. The value of your investment may increase
or may decline and could result in a loss. You should carefully consider the following factors as well as the
other information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. For

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Risks Relating to the Transaction,"Risks Relating to the Transaction
Because the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may fluctuate and the exchange ratio and per share
cash amount are both fixed, Terminix stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration
that they will receive in the transaction.
Upon completion of the transaction, Terminix stockholders will be entitled to receive for each share of
Terminix common stock that they own, at the election of the holders of such shares and subject to certain
allocation and proration provisions in the merger agreement described under the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132 and
“The Merger Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations”
beginning on page 135, either (1) a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs (each representing a beneficial interest in
five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) equal to (A) the exchange ratio plus (B) the quotient of the per share
cash amount and the Rentokil Initial ADS price or (2) an amount in cash, without interest, and in U.S. dollars
equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product of the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial
ADS price. Based on Rentokil Initial’s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day
average of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to
December 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders as of the
date of announcement of the transaction was approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock.
Based on Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted average share price and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange
rate, in each case, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix
stockholders was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock.
Because the exchange ratio and per share cash amount are both fixed, the value of the merger consideration
will depend on the Rentokil Initial ADS price as of the measurement day. The merger consideration will not be
adjusted for changes in the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Terminix common stock or in
currency exchange rates between the date of signing the merger agreement and the closing date. In addition,
there will be a lapse of time between the date on which Terminix stockholders vote on the merger proposal at
the Terminix special meeting and the date on which Terminix stockholders entitled to receive the merger
consideration actually receive the merger consideration.
The market value of the merger consideration and the market value of Terminix common stock at the first
effective time may vary significantly from their respective values on the date that the merger agreement was
executed or at other dates, such as the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Terminix
special meeting, the measurement day or the date on which a Terminix stockholder actually receives the
merger consideration. These changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in Rentokil
Initial’s or Terminix’s respective businesses, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations and general
business, market, industry or economic conditions. The merger consideration will not be adjusted to reflect
the comparative value of pounds sterling and the U.S. dollar or the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares or the Terminix common stock. Therefore, the aggregate market value of the merger consideration that
a Terminix stockholder is entitled to receive at the time that the transaction is completed could vary
significantly from the value of the merger consideration on the date of this proxy statement/
37 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
prospectus, the date of the Terminix special meeting, the measurement day or the date on which a Terminix
stockholder actually receives the merger consideration.
Rentokil Initial ordinary shareholders and Terminix stockholders are urged to obtain current market
quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock. See the section entitled
“Comparative Per Share Market Price” beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement/prospectus for more
information about the market value of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock on certain
dates.
Certain Terminix stockholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what they elect.
While each holder of Terminix common stock entitled to the merger consideration may elect to receive, in
connection with the transaction, either cash consideration or stock consideration, the total amount of cash
and the total number of shares of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs)
available for all Terminix stockholders are fixed pursuant to the merger agreement. Accordingly, depending
on the elections made by other Terminix stockholders, if a holder of Terminix common stock elects to receive
all cash in connection with the transaction, such holder may receive a portion of the merger consideration in
Rentokil Initial ADSs and if a holder of Terminix common stock elects to receive all Rentokil Initial ADSs in
connection with the transaction, such holder may receive a portion of the merger consideration in cash. See
section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132 of this proxy
statement/prospectus for more information. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration
of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning
on page 135. If a holder of Terminix common stock does not submit a properly completed and signed form of
election to the exchange agent by the election deadline, then such stockholder will be deemed to have
elected to receive the stock consideration. No fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs will be issued in the
transaction, and Terminix stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional Rentokil Initial ADSs.
If you make a cash/stock election, you will not be able to sell those shares unless you revoke your election prior to
the election deadline.
If you are a holder of Terminix common stock and want to elect to receive the cash consideration or stock
consideration in exchange for your shares, you must deliver to the exchange agent by the election deadline a
properly completed form of election. Following the delivery of a completed form of election, you will not be
able to transfer such shares of Terminix common stock unless you revoke your election before the election
deadline by providing an acceptable written notice to the exchange agent. If you do not revoke your election
before the election deadline, you will not be able to liquidate your investment in Terminix common stock for
any reason until you receive the merger consideration.
The market price for Rentokil Initial ADSs may be affected by different factors from those that historically have
affected the market price of Terminix common stock.
Upon completion of the transaction, Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the
transaction will become Rentokil Initial ADS holders. Rentokil Initial’s businesses differ from those of
Terminix, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Rentokil Initial will be affected by some factors that
are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Terminix. For a discussion of the
businesses of Terminix and Rentokil Initial and of some important factors to consider in connection with
those businesses, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Business of Rentokil Initial”
beginning on page 234 and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and
referred to in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information” beginning on page 328.
There is no assurance when or if the transaction will be completed.
The completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set
forth in the merger agreement, including, among others, (i) the adoption of the merger agreement by the
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock entitled to vote on
the merger proposal, (ii) affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding
ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial at a duly convened and held meeting of Rentokil Initial’s shareholders at
which a quorum is present approving the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals, (iii) approval for
listing on the NYSE of the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented thereby) to
be issued in connection with the transaction, subject to official notice of issuance, (iv) acknowledgement by
the FCA of the approval of the application for the admission of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented
by the Rentokil Initial ADSs to the premium listing segment of the official list, (v) acknowledgement by the
FCA and the LSE of the admission of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by the Rentokil Initial
ADSs to the premium listing segment of the FCA’s official list and to trading on the LSE’s main market for
listed securities, (vi) the approval by the FCA of Rentokil Initial’s prospectus (which will be combined with
the shareholder circular referenced below) and publication thereof in accordance with the prospectus
regulation rules, (vii) the approval by the FCA of Rentokil Initial’s shareholder circular (which will be
combined with the prospectus referenced above) and the distribution thereof to Rentokil Initial shareholders
in accordance with the FCA’s Listing Rules and the articles of association of Rentokil Initial, (viii) the
absence of any law, injunction or other order that prohibits or makes illegal the completion of the transaction,
(ix) effectiveness of the registration statement for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to be issued in the
transaction (of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part) and of the registration statement on
Form F-6 relating to the Rentokil Initial ADSs and the absence of any stop order suspending that
effectiveness or any proceedings for that purpose pending before the SEC, and (x) other customary closing
conditions, including the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties (subject to specified
materiality qualifiers), and each party’s material compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in
the merger agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if
at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the transaction.
Certain Terminix agreements may contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions that may be triggered by
the transaction and that, if acted upon or not waived, could cause the combined company to lose the benefit of such
agreement(s) and incur liabilities or replacement costs, which could have an adverse effect on the combined
company.
Terminix is party to, or may become party to after the date hereof, various agreements with third parties that
may contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions that may be triggered upon the completion of
the transaction. Agreements with such provisions may provide for or permit the termination of the agreement
upon the occurrence of a change of control of, or the assignment of such contract by, one of the parties
unless it is waived by the relevant counterparties. In the event that there is such a contract or arrangement
requiring a consent or waiver in relation to the transaction or the merger agreement, for which such consent
or waiver was not obtained, the combined company could lose the benefit of the underlying agreement and
incur liabilities or replacement costs, which could have an adverse effect on the operations of the combined
company.
The combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.
There is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction may fail to materialize, or may not
occur within the time periods anticipated by Rentokil Initial and Terminix. The realization of such benefits
may be affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Rentokil Initial and
Terminix. The challenge of integrating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business
and future financial prospects of the combined company following the transaction difficult. Terminix and
Rentokil Initial have operated and, until completion of the transaction, will continue to operate,
independently. The success of the transaction, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend,
in part, on the ability to successfully integrate the operations of both companies in a manner that results in
various benefits, including, among other things, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies that do
not materially disrupt existing customer relationships (including as a result of customer relationships based
on personal relationships being disrupted or lost due to personnel changes) nor result in decreased
revenues or dividends due to the full or partial loss of customers. The past financial performance of each of
Terminix and Rentokil Initial may not be indicative of the future financial performance of the combined
company.

levels per share consistent with the current dividend or at all. The declaration of dividends by the combined
company will be at the discretion of its board of directors, which may determine at any time to cease paying
dividends, lower the dividend level per share or not increase the dividend level per share.
Because Rentokil Initial is a holding company and substantially all of its operations will be conducted through its
subsidiaries, its ability to pay dividends on the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares depends on its ability to obtain cash
dividends or other cash payments or to obtain loans from such entities.
Rentokil Initial’s ability to pay dividends is limited under English company law, which limits an English
company to only pay cash dividends or make other distributions to the extent it has sufficient distributable
reserves and cash available for this purpose. Rentokil Initial conducts substantially all of its operations
through its subsidiaries and such entities will generate substantially all of its operating income and cash
flow. As a holding company, Rentokil Initial’s ability to pay dividends in the future is affected by a number of
factors, principally its ability to receive sufficient dividends from its subsidiaries. The ability of such entities
to make dividend payments to Rentokil Initial depends largely on their financial condition and ability to
generate profits. In addition, because Rentokil Initial’s subsidiaries are, and the combined company’s
subsidiaries will be, separate and distinct legal entities, they will have, to the extent they have not agreed
otherwise by entering into a separate agreement with Rentokil Initial, no obligation to pay any dividends or
to lend or advance to Rentokil Initial funds and may be restricted from doing so by contract, including under
financing arrangements, charter provisions, other shareholders or the applicable laws and regulations of the
various countries in which they operate. Additionally, claims of the creditors of Rentokil Initial’s subsidiaries
have (and will continue to have) priority over any claims that Rentokil Initial may have with respect to the
assets of its subsidiaries. Although the combined company plans to remain committed to Rentokil Initial’s
current progressive dividend policy, there can be no assurance that, in the long term, the combined
company’s subsidiaries will generate sufficient profits and cash flows, or otherwise prove willing or able, to
pay dividends or lend or advance to Rentokil Initial sufficient funds to enable it to pay interest, principal or
expenses to any third party, if any, or to enable it to declare and pay dividends, if any, on the Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares. The inability of one or more of the combined company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or
lend or advance funds to Rentokil Initial could, in the long term, have a material adverse effect on its
business, cash flows, financial condition and the results of its operations.
The announcement and pendency of the transaction could adversely affect each of Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s
respective businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
The announcement and pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty
surrounding Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s business, including affecting Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s
relationships with existing and future customers and suppliers, which could have an adverse effect on
Terminix’s or Rentokil Initial’s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects,
regardless of whether the transaction is completed. Terminix and Rentokil Initial could also potentially lose
customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition,
each of Terminix and Rentokil Initial has expended, and continues to expend, significant management
resources in an effort to complete the transaction, which are being diverted from Terminix’s and Rentokil
Initial’s day-to-day operations.
If the transaction is not completed, Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s stock or share prices, as applicable, may
fall if and to the extent that the current prices of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed. In addition, the failure to complete the
transaction may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of Terminix and Rentokil Initial in the
investment community and may affect Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s relationship with employees,
customers, suppliers and other partners in the business community.
Terminix and Rentokil Initial will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the transaction.
Terminix and Rentokil Initial have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in
connection with the transaction and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger
40 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
agreement, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals and in change in control payments.
Terminix and Rentokil Initial have incurred significant financial services, accounting, tax and legal fees in
connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the transaction. Additional
significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating the businesses of Terminix and
Rentokil Initial after completion of the transaction. Even if the transaction is not completed, Terminix and
Rentokil Initial will need to pay certain costs relating to the transaction incurred prior to the date the
transaction was abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing and printing fees. Such
costs may be significant and could have an adverse effect on the parties’ future results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition.
In addition to its own fees and expenses, in the event the Terminix stockholders do not approve the matters
required to be voted upon, and as a result the merger agreement is terminated, Terminix may be required to
pay by way of compensation an amount equal to $50 million to Rentokil Initial. In addition to its own fees
and expenses, in the event the Rentokil Initial shareholders do not approve the matters required to be voted
upon, and therefore the merger agreement is terminated, Rentokil Initial may be required to pay by way of
compensation an amount equal to $50 million to Terminix. Terminix may also be required to pay Rentokil
Initial by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million if the merger agreement is terminated
under the circumstances specified in the merger agreement, and Rentokil Initial may be required to pay
Terminix by way of compensation a termination payment of $150 million if the merger agreement is terminated
under the circumstances specified in the merger agreement. For more information, see the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Termination Payments and Expenses” beginning on page 161.
The transaction may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Rentokil Initial’s earnings per share, which may
negatively affect the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the Rentokil Initial
ADSs following the transaction.
In connection with the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial expects to issue approximately 643
million new Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, in the form of Rentokil Initial ADSs, and certain Terminix equity
awards are required to be converted into equity awards of Rentokil Initial pursuant to the merger agreement.
The issuance of new Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, in the form of Rentokil Initial ADSs, could have the
effect of depressing the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.
Rentokil Initial currently projects that the transaction will result in a number of benefits, including increased
scale and an enlarged platform for profitable growth, and that it will ultimately be accretive to Rentokil
Initial’s earnings per share. This projection is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change.
Future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the
transaction being dilutive to Rentokil Initial’s earnings per share, including adverse changes in market
conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to
realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the transaction. Any dilution of, reduction in or delay of any
accretion to, Rentokil Initial’s earnings per share could cause the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and
the implied value of the Rentokil Initial ADSs to decline or grow at a reduced rate.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Terminix and Rentokil Initial is presented
for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations or financial condition of the
combined company following the transaction.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy
statement/​prospectus has been prepared using the consolidated historical financial statements of Rentokil
Initial and Terminix, is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an
indication of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company following the
transaction. In addition, the pro forma combined financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the transaction. These assumptions
may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company’s results of operations or
financial condition following the transaction. Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financial information
included in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily represent the combined company’s results
of operations and financial condition had Terminix and Rentokil Initial operated as a combined entity during
the periods presented, or of the combined company’s results of operations and financial condition following
completion
41 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the transaction. The combined company’s potential for future business success and operating profitability
must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties that may be encountered by
recently combined companies.
In preparing the pro forma financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, Rentokil
Initial has given effect to, among other items, the completion of the transaction, the payment of the merger
consideration and the indebtedness of Rentokil Initial on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the
transaction, including the indebtedness of Terminix. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not
reflect all of the costs that are expected to be incurred by Terminix and Rentokil Initial in connection with the
transaction. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Rentokil
Initial Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information,” including the notes thereto, beginning on
page 164.
Rentokil Initial or Terminix may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder
approval or stockholder approval, respectively.
Certain conditions to Rentokil Initial and Terminix’s obligations, respectively, to complete the transaction
may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally permissible, either unilaterally or by agreement by
either Rentokil Initial or Terminix. In the event that any such waiver does not require resolicitation of
Rentokil Initial’s shareholders or Terminix’s stockholders or the amendment of this proxy
statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards (as applicable), the parties will have
the discretion to complete the transaction without seeking further approval of Rentokil Initial shareholders or
Terminix stockholders, as applicable.
The opinion of Terminix’s financial advisor rendered to Terminix’s Board of Directors does not reflect changes in
circumstances between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the transaction.
Terminix’s board of directors has received an opinion from Lazard dated December 13, 2021 to the effect that,
as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in
Lazard’s written opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of Terminix
common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, but has not obtained an updated
opinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations and prospects of
Rentokil Initial or Terminix, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond
the control of Rentokil Initial or Terminix, and on which the forecasts and assumptions used by Terminix’s
financial advisors in connection with rendering its opinion may have been based, may significantly alter the
value of Rentokil Initial or Terminix or the prices of the Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares represented thereby) or of the shares of Terminix common stock by the time the transaction is
completed. The opinion did not speak as of the time the transaction will be completed or as of any date other
than the date of such opinion and Terminix’s board of directors does not anticipate asking its financial
advisor to update its opinion. The Terminix board of directors’ recommendation that Terminix stockholders
vote “FOR” approval of the merger proposal and “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal,
however, is made as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion that
Terminix’s board of directors received from its financial advisor, see the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Opinion of Terminix’s Financial Advisor” beginning
on page 89. A copy of the opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC, Terminix’s financial advisor, is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
While the merger agreement is in effect, Terminix, Rentokil Initial and their respective subsidiaries’ businesses are
subject to restrictions on their business activities.
Under the merger agreement, Terminix, Rentokil Initial and their respective subsidiaries have agreed to
certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective businesses and generally must operate their respective
businesses in the ordinary course prior to completing the transaction (unless Terminix or Rentokil Initial
obtains the other’s consent, as applicable, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), which may restrict Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s ability to exercise certain of their respective
business strategies. These restrictions may prevent Terminix and Rentokil Initial from pursuing otherwise
attractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, engaging in
capital
42

• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
expenditures in excess of certain agreed limits, continuing share repurchase programs, incurring
indebtedness or making changes to Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s respective businesses prior to the
completion of the transaction or termination of the merger agreement, as applicable. These restrictions could
have an adverse effect on Terminix’s and Rentokil Initial’s business, financial results, financial condition or
share price.
In addition, the merger agreement prohibits Terminix and Rentokil Initial from (i) soliciting, initiating,
knowingly facilitating or knowingly encouraging, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger
agreement, any inquiry or the making or submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes an acquisition
proposal (as defined for each party in the merger agreement), (ii) (A) entering into or participating in any
discussions or negotiations with any third party, (B) furnishing to any third party any information, or (C)
otherwise assisting, participating in, knowingly facilitating or knowingly encouraging any third party, in each
case, in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an acquisition proposal,
or (iii) approving, recommending or entering into (or publicly or formally proposing to approve, recommend
or enter into), any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with
respect to an acquisition proposal. Terminix may be required to pay Rentokil Initial by way of compensation a
termination payment of $200 million if the merger agreement is terminated under the circumstances specified
in the merger agreement, and Rentokil Initial may be required to pay Terminix by way of compensation a
termination payment of $150 million if the merger agreement is terminated under the circumstances specified
in the merger agreement.
These provisions may limit Terminix’s ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater
value to Terminix stockholders than the merger consideration. The termination payment may also discourage
third parties from pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal with respect to Terminix.
The termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact Terminix.
If the transaction is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Terminix stockholders failing to
approve the merger proposal, the ongoing businesses of Terminix may be adversely affected and, without
realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the transaction, Terminix would be subject to a
number of risks, including the following:
Terminix may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a decline of its stock
price (which may reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed);
Terminix may experience negative reactions from the investment community, its customers, suppliers,
distributors, regulators and employees and other partners in the business community;
Terminix may be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the
transaction is completed; and
matters relating to the transaction will have required substantial commitments of time and resources
by Terminix management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and
other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Terminix had the transaction not been
contemplated.
If the merger agreement is terminated and the Terminix board of directors seeks another merger, business
combination or other transaction, Terminix stockholders cannot be certain that Terminix will find a party
willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the merger consideration Terminix
stockholders would receive from Rentokil Initial in the transaction. If the merger agreement is terminated
under the circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Terminix may be required to pay Rentokil Initial
by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million or a no vote reimbursement of $50 million,
depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. If the merger agreement is terminated under
the circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Rentokil Initial may be required to pay Terminix by way
of compensation a termination payment of $150 million or a no vote reimbursement of $50 million, depending
on the circumstance surrounding the termination. If a no vote reimbursement is paid by Terminix or Rentokil
Initial and the Terminix termination payment or Rentokil Initial termination payment subsequently becomes
due, then the amount of the Terminix or Rentokil Initial termination payment, as applicable, will be reduced by
the amount of no vote reimbursement expenses previously paid.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the
Merger Agreement” beginning on page 160 for a more complete discussion of the circumstances under which
the merger agreement could be terminated and when the termination payment and the no vote reimbursement
may be payable by Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as applicable.
Directors and executive officers of Terminix have interests in the transaction that may differ from the interests of
Terminix stockholders generally, including, if the transaction is completed, the receipt of financial and other
benefits.
In considering the recommendation of the Terminix board of directors, you should be aware that Terminix’s
directors and executive officers may have interests in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to,
those of Terminix stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the treatment of
outstanding Terminix equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement, the payment of severance benefits
and acceleration of outstanding Terminix equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, and the
combined company’s agreement to indemnify Terminix directors and executive officers against certain claims
and liabilities. These interests are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction”
beginning on page 105.
Except in specified circumstances, if the transaction is not completed by December 31, 2022, subject to extension in
specified circumstances by either Terminix or Rentokil Initial, either Terminix or Rentokil Initial may choose not to
proceed with the transaction.
Either Terminix or Rentokil Initial may terminate the merger agreement if the transaction has not been
completed by December 31, 2022. However, this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available
to Terminix or Rentokil Initial if such party’s material breach of any of its obligations under the merger
agreement has been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the transaction to be completed on or
before such time. The end date may be extended by Terminix or Rentokil Initial to March 13, 2023 if, at the
time of any such extension, the antitrust-related conditions are not satisfied but all other closing conditions
(other than conditions that by their terms can only be satisfied at the closing if such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied on such date) have been satisfied or waived. For more information, see
the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 160.
Following the closing, there may be less publicly available information concerning Rentokil Initial than there is for
issuers that are not foreign private issuers because, as a foreign private issuer, Rentokil Initial would be exempt
from a number of rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and would be permitted to file less information with the SEC
than issuers that are not foreign private issuers and Rentokil Initial, as a foreign private issuer, would be permitted
to follow home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of NYSE, subject to certain exceptions.
As a foreign private issuer under the U.S. Exchange Act, Rentokil Initial would be exempt from certain rules
under the U.S. Exchange Act, and would not be required to file periodic reports and financial statements with
the SEC as frequently or as promptly as companies whose securities are registered under the U.S. Exchange
Act but are not foreign private issuers, or to comply with Regulation FD, which restricts the selective
disclosure of material non-public information. In addition, Rentokil Initial would be exempt from certain
disclosure and procedural requirements applicable to proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the U.S.
Exchange Act. The members of the Rentokil Initial management board, officers and principal shareholders
would be exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the U.S.
Exchange Act. Accordingly, following the closing, there may be less publicly available information
concerning Rentokil Initial than there is for companies whose securities are registered under the U.S.
Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, and such information may not be provided as promptly as it
is provided by such companies. In addition, certain information may be provided by Rentokil Initial in
accordance with English law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements
under the U.S. Exchange Act.
Further, as a foreign private issuer, Rentokil Initial would be subject to less stringent corporate governance
requirements under the NYSE rules. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of the NYSE
44 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
permit a foreign private issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the
NYSE, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as certain board, committee and director
independence requirements. Rentokil Initial would be required to disclose any significant way in which its
corporate governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NYSE
listing standings in its annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC or on its website. Accordingly, you may
not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are required to comply with all of
the NYSE corporate governance requirements.
Rentokil Initial is organized under the laws of England and Wales and a substantial portion of its assets are, and
many of its directors and officers reside, outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States against Rentokil Initial or
Rentokil Initial’s officers and members of the Rentokil Initial board of directors.
Rentokil Initial is organized under the laws of England and Wales. A substantial portion of Rentokil Initial’s
assets are located outside the United States, and many of Rentokil Initial’s directors and officers and some of
the experts named in this proxy statement/prospectus are residents of jurisdictions outside of the United
States and the assets of such persons may be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be
difficult for investors to effect service within the United States upon Rentokil Initial and those directors,
officers and experts, or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against Rentokil Initial or such persons
either inside or outside of the United States, or to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against Rentokil
Initial or such persons in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States, in any action predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.
There is no certainty that civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United
States can be enforced in England, whether by original action or by seeking to enforce a judgment of U.S.
courts. In addition, punitive damages awards in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be
unenforceable in England.
Resales of Rentokil Initial ADSs following the transaction may cause the market value of Rentokil Initial ADSs to
decline.
Rentokil Initial expects that it will issue up to approximately 643 million Rentokil Initial ordinary shares at the
first effective time in connection with the transaction. The issuance of these new Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares and the new Rentokil Initial ADSs by which those Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are represented,
and the sale of Rentokil Initial ADSs from time to time (and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented
thereby) could have the effect of depressing the market value for Rentokil Initial ADSs (and Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares represented thereby) as a consequence of the transaction. The increase in the number of
Rentokil Initial ADSs may lead to sales of such Rentokil Initial ADSs or the perception that such sales may
occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, Rentokil Initial ADSs.
An active trading market for Rentokil Initial ADSs may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and
price of Rentokil Initial ADSs.
The existing Rentokil Initial ADSs are not listed on any U.S. stock exchange. Following the closing, an active
trading market for the Rentokil Initial ADSs may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. If an
active public market for Rentokil Initial ADSs does not develop, the market price and liquidity of Rentokil
Initial ADSs may be adversely affected. Rentokil Initial shareholders may be unable to sell their Rentokil
Initial ADSs unless a market can be established and sustained.
The Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares have different rights from the shares of Terminix
common stock.
Certain of the rights associated with Terminix common stock are different from the rights associated with
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Comparison of
Rights of Rentokil Initial Shareholders and Terminix Stockholders” beginning on page 211 for a discussion
of the different rights associated with Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock. In
addition, holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs will be able to exercise the shareholder rights for Rentokil Initial
45 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
ordinary shares represented by such Rentokil Initial ADSs through the depositary bank, only to the extent
contemplated by the deposit agreement. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement/​
prospectus entitled “Description of Rentokil Initial American Depositary Shares” beginning on page 202.
In particular, the laws of England and Wales, the jurisdiction in which Rentokil Initial is incorporated, limit
the circumstances under which shareholders of a company may bring derivative actions on behalf of that
company. In most cases, only the corporation may be the claimant or plaintiff for the purposes of maintaining
proceedings in respect of any wrongful act committed against it and the permission of the court is required
to maintain any derivative action, which is able to be brought by shareholders. In addition, the laws of
England and Wales do not afford appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders in the form typically available to
shareholders of a U.S. corporation. English law also requires that shareholders approve certain capital
structure decisions (including the allotment and issuance of shares, the exclusion of preemptive rights and
share repurchases), which may limit Rentokil Initial’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.
In addition, only registered holders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are afforded the rights of shareholders
under English law and the Rentokil Initial articles of association. Because the depositary bank holds Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs through a custodian which is a participant in the
CREST securities settlement system (“CREST”), and CREST or its nominee is the registered holder of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs, the holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs
must rely on the depositary bank to exercise the rights of a shareholder via its custodian and CREST.
Holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs are entitled to present Rentokil Initial ADSs to the depositary bank for
cancellation and withdraw the corresponding number of underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, but
would be responsible for fees relating to such exchange. Fees and charges are also payable by Rentokil
Initial ADS holders in relation to certain other depositary services.
Current Rentokil Initial shareholders and Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the
transaction will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction.
Upon completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial expects to issue approximately 129 million Rentokil Initial
ADSs to Terminix stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement. As a result, it is expected that, immediately
after completion of the transaction, former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the
transaction will own approximately 25.7% of the outstanding Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. In addition,
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may be issued from time to time following the first effective time to holders of
Terminix equity awards on the terms set forth in the merger agreement. See the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Transaction,” “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Terminix Equity Awards” and “The
Merger Agreement - Treatment of Terminix Employee Stock Purchase Plan” beginning on pages 105, 139
and 140, respectively, for a more detailed explanation.
Terminix is, and Rentokil Initial may become, the target of securities class actions and derivative lawsuits which
could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed.
As at the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, three securities stockholder derivative lawsuits have been
brought against Terminix and its board of directors and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. Such
lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits
are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time
and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation
of the transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed. Given the
early stage of the existing proceedings, it is impossible to predict the outcome or estimate possible loss or
range of loss.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined
company’s business and operations.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs or
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties due to the
46 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
combination of Rentokil Initial’s business and Terminix’s business following the transaction. For information
regarding such litigation, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Proposal - Litigation Related to the Transaction” beginning on page 114. Such litigation may have an
adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to
the combined company’s operations.
The transaction may affect the application of new or existing tax rules to the combined company, which could result
in a material impact on the combined company’s cash tax liabilities and tax charges.
Changes in tax regimes, such as those that have been proposed by the current administration in the United
States that include raising the corporate tax rate and raising the tax rate on global intangible low-taxed
income, could result in a material impact on the cash tax liabilities and tax charges of the combined company.
The Rentokil Initial group will have a greater presence in the United States following the acquisition of
Terminix than the existing Rentokil Initial group, which means that changes to tax rules in the United States
could have a more significant impact. Such an impact could also arise from changes in the application of
existing tax rules, including UK tax rules, to the Rentokil Initial group as a result of the transaction. In either
case, this could result in a reduction in financial results depending upon the nature of the change.
Prior to the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial and Terminix (and with effect from the completion of the
transaction, the combined company) may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other
employees in light of the transaction.
Rentokil Initial’s success after the transaction will depend in part on its ability to retain key executives and
other employees. Uncertainty about the effect of the transaction on Rentokil Initial and Terminix employees
may have an adverse effect on each of Rentokil Initial and Terminix and consequently on the combined
company. This uncertainty may impair, prior to the completion of the transaction, Rentokil Initial’s and/or
Terminix’s, and following the completion of the transaction, the combined company’s, ability to attract, retain
and motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the
transaction, as employees of Rentokil Initial and Terminix may experience uncertainty about their future roles
in the combined company.
Additionally, Terminix’s officers and employees may hold shares of Terminix common stock and/or certain
equity awards, and, if the transaction is completed, these officers and employees may be entitled to the
merger consideration in respect of such shares of Terminix common stock and/or certain equity awards.
Under agreements between Terminix and certain of its employees, such employees could potentially resign
from employment on or after the first effective time that could result in severance payments to such
employees and accelerated vesting of their equity awards. These payments and accelerated vesting benefits,
individually or in the aggregate, could make retention of Terminix employees more difficult.
Furthermore, if employees of Rentokil Initial or Terminix depart or are at risk of departing, including because
of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become
employees of the combined company, Rentokil Initial may have to incur significant costs in retaining such
individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose
significant expertise and talent. As a result, the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated
benefits of the transaction may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the
combined company will be able to attract or retain employees to the same extent that Terminix has been able
to attract or retain employees in the past.
The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Rentokil Initial and Terminix to pursue
alternatives to the transaction and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Terminix for greater
consideration than Rentokil Initial has agreed to pay.
The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Terminix to sell its business to a
party other than Rentokil Initial, or for Rentokil Initial to pursue alternatives to the transaction. These
provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any acquisition proposal. Further, there are
only limited exceptions to each party’s agreement that its board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement. In the event that either the Terminix board of directors or the Rentokil
47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Initial board of directors make an adverse recommendation change, then Terminix and Rentokil Initial may be
required to pay to the other party by way of compensation a termination payment of $200 million and $150
million, respectively. See “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation” and “The Merger Agreement - 
Termination Payments and Expenses” beginning on pages 150 and 161, respectively, of this proxy
statement/prospectus.
The parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions
might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either Terminix or
Rentokil Initial from considering or proposing an acquisition proposal, even if that party were prepared to
pay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed merger consideration, in the
case of Terminix, or that party were prepared to enter into an agreement that may be favorable to Rentokil
Initial or its shareholders, in the case of Rentokil Initial. Furthermore, the termination payments described
above may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per-share price to acquire the
applicable party than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the
termination payment that may become payable by such party in certain circumstances.
The financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.
The financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the section “The Merger Proposal - Certain
Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” were based on assumptions of, and information
available to, Terminix’s management when prepared and these estimates and assumptions are subject to
uncertainties, many of which are beyond Terminix’s control and may not be realized. Many factors mentioned
in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks outlined in this “Risk Factors” section and the
events or circumstances described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,”
will be important in determining the combined company’s future results. As a result of these contingencies,
actual future results may vary materially from the estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of
financial estimates in this proxy statement is not and should not be viewed as a representation that the
forecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.

Risks Relating to Business Strategies and Operations
If Rentokil Initial is unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions (including the transaction) or if its disposals result in
unexpected costs or liabilities, its business could be materially and adversely affected.
Rentokil Initial has a strategy that includes growth by acquisition, for example it acquired 52 new businesses
in 2021. M&A activity is a core part of Rentokil Initial’s strategy to extend its geographic footprint and to
improve its market share in existing locations, and Rentokil Initial may continue to pursue strategic
transactions in the future, which could involve acquisitions or disposals of businesses or assets. There are a
number of risks to the successful integration of acquired businesses. These risks include the possibility that
management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and that
unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and retaining and assimilating the
employees. In addition, even where a diligent review of the businesses and/or properties acquired in
connection with such acquisitions is performed in accordance with industry norms, such reviews may be
incomplete and not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems, including actual or contingent
liabilities, or permit a full assessment of the deficiencies associated with the businesses or properties. Any
acquisition that Rentokil Initial makes may not provide it with the benefits that were anticipated when
acquisition that Rentokil Initial makes may not provide it with the benefits that were anticipated when
entering into such acquisition. If Rentokil Initial fails to (i) successfully integrate acquisitions into its
existing organizational structures; (ii) deliver the revenue and profit targets; or (iii) deliver any expected
synergy benefits such as cost savings, the acquired business may not achieve the expected financial and
operational benefits which could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on Rentokil
Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. There is a risk that
the transaction and integration of Rentokil Initial and Terminix may consume management time and
resources, making the execution of M&A activity in furtherance of the combined company’s strategy more
difficult to execute.
In addition, Rentokil Initial has sold a number of its businesses in the past and expects to continue to
dispose of businesses from time to time if consistent with its strategy. Furthermore, under business sale
contracts, Rentokil Initial may provide warranties and indemnities to purchasers. Accordingly, Rentokil Initial
may make provisions in its consolidated financial statements for potential liabilities and costs relating to a
disposed business. Rentokil Initial may also make provision in its financial statements for amounts to cover
legal or regulatory claims which are known to be outstanding at the time of sale or which may subsequently
become apparent. There can be no assurance that such provisions will be sufficient to cover potential
liabilities and consequently disposals of Rentokil Initial’s businesses may have a material adverse effect on
its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial may experience difficulties integrating, streamlining and optimizing its IT systems, processes and
technologies.
Rentokil Initial has invested in, and expects to continue to invest in, a wide range of new systems, processes
and technologies intended to improve many aspects of its business. These systems, processes and
technologies impact customers, suppliers, employees and others, including new systems that integrate,
streamline and enhance legacy operating IT systems. These activities have required, and may continue to
49 TABLE OF CONTENTS
require, significant investment of human and financial resources. Rentokil Initial may experience significant
delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a consequence of significant disruption or deficiency in
implementing such systems, processes and technologies, which could adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s
ability to process work orders, send invoices and track and collect payments, fulfill contractual obligations
or otherwise operate its business. In addition, Rentokil Initial’s efforts to centralize various business
processes within its organization in connection with this implementation may disrupt operations and
negatively impact Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects. Rentokil Initial may also experience difficulties, costs or delays in migrating acquired businesses
to its systems, processes and technologies.
Rentokil Initial depends on a suitably skilled and qualified labor force to maintain the business.
Rentokil Initial’s ability to maintain its customer service and execute its business strategy depends on its
ability to attract and retain a suitably skilled and qualified labor force. There can be no assurance that
Rentokil Initial will be able to recruit, train and retain such a labor force in sufficient numbers or of sufficient
quality, or that pressure to recruit will not lead to a significant increase in employee costs. In markets where
overall employment rates are high, and/or its business is growing quickly either organically or through
acquisitions, Rentokil Initial may have difficulties attracting, training and retaining operational personnel of
suitable capability. In addition, changes in the global job market (including those caused or accelerated by
the COVID-19 pandemic) may cause (or continue to cause) difficulty in recruiting, training and retaining a
suitably skilled and qualified labor force. As a result, Rentokil Initial could experience difficulty in
responding to customer calls in a timely fashion or delivering its services in a high-quality or timely manner,
and could be forced to increase wages to attract, train and retain colleagues, which would result in higher
operating costs and reduced profitability. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on
Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Moreover, some of Rentokil Initial’s colleagues are members of local trade unions and similar organizations.
Industrial action in key operations could result in diminished customer service levels or higher costs and, if
prolonged, could damage Rentokil Initial’s reputation and ability to retain existing customers or acquire new
customers. Although Rentokil Initial believes that all of Rentokil Initial’s operations have good relations with
their colleagues and the trade unions that represent those colleagues (where applicable), there can be no
assurance that work stoppages or other labor-related developments (including the introduction of new labor
regulations in countries where Rentokil Initial operates) will not adversely affect its business, reputation,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In addition, potential competition from key
colleagues who leave Rentokil Initial could impact its ability to maintain its market share in certain
geographic areas.
Rentokil Initial depends on key personnel to lead Rentokil Initial’s business.
Rentokil Initial’s continued success will largely depend on its ability to attract, retain and develop a high
caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of its executive officers and certain other key colleagues. As
Rentokil Initial continues to grow its business, make acquisitions, expand its geographic scope and offer new
products and services, Rentokil Initial needs the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective
succession for executive officer and key colleague roles in order to meet the growth, development and
profitability goals of its business. Rentokil Initial’s operations could be materially and adversely affected if
for any reason Rentokil Initial was unable to attract, retain or develop such officers or key colleagues and
successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels.
ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on Rentokil
Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Increased focus and activism related to ESG matters may hinder Rentokil Initial’s access to capital, as
investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of Rentokil Initial’s ESG
practices. Customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on ESG issues,
including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, human and animal health and welfare,
chemical usage and other concerns. Changing customer preferences are resulting in, and may continue to
50 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
result in, increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-
recyclable plastic packaging, and other components of Rentokil Initial’s products and their impact on human
and animal health and environmental sustainability; a growing demand for natural, organic or non-toxic
products and ingredients; or increased customer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate)
regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain products. Certain animal welfare
advocacy groups may raise concerns regarding products such as glue boards or snap traps perceived to
have animal cruelty issues. These demands, perceptions and preferences could cause Rentokil Initial to incur
additional costs or to make changes to its operations to comply with such demands and customer
preferences, and a delay in Rentokil Initial’s response (or the failure to respond effectively) may lead to
adverse effects to its business, results of operations and financial condition, and recruitment and retention
of the labor force that it needs.
Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased
legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory
requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including disclosure requirements, may result in
increased compliance costs or input costs of energy and raw materials, which may cause disruptions in the
manufacture of Rentokil Initial’s products or an increase in operating costs, and these costs could have a
material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s results of operations and cash flows. Any failure to achieve its
ESG goals or a perception (whether or not valid) of its failure to act responsibly with respect to ESG issues or
to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or
other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation could
adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition and/or
prospects. In addition, Rentokil Initial may also be adversely impacted as a result of conduct by contactors,
customers or suppliers that fail to meet Rentokil Initial’s or its stakeholders’ ESG standards.
Inflationary pressures, such as increases in wages, fuel prices and other operating costs, could adversely impact
Rentokil Initial’s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial’s financial performance may be adversely affected by sudden or material increases in the level
of its operating costs and expenses, which may be subject to inflationary pressures, and it may not be able
to pass these increases on fully, or in a timely manner, to customers. For example, fuel prices are subject to
market volatility, and Rentokil Initial’s fleet has been negatively impacted by significant increases in fuel
prices in the past and could be negatively impacted in the future. In addition, Rentokil Initial continues to
monitor any adverse impact that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the subsequent institution and
extension of sanctions against various Russian organizations, companies and individuals may have on the
global economy in general and on Rentokil Initial’s business operations, although Rentokil Initial has no
direct operations in Russia or the Ukraine. Such events have increased fuel prices, and a prolonged conflict
may have further negative consequences such as increased inflation and transportation costs. Fuel price
increases have also caused increases in the cost of chemicals and other materials used in Rentokil Initial’s
business. Increases in fuel, and other costs, have not negatively affected Rentokil Initial’s results of
operations as of June 30, 2022, as Rentokil Initial has been able to pass along such increases to customers in
the form of increased prices. However, Rentokil Initial cannot predict the extent to which it may experience
future cost increases. To the extent such costs increase further, Rentokil Initial may be prevented, in whole
or in part, from passing these cost increases on to its existing and prospective customers, which could have
a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial’s results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Supply chain issues may result in product shortages or disruptions to Rentokil Initial’s business.
Rentokil Initial has a complex global network of suppliers that has recently expanded to meet increased
customer demand and may, in the future, further evolve in response to market conditions. Although the
majority of the products used by Rentokil Initial are generally available from multiple sources, and
alternatives have been generally available in the event of disruption in the past, Rentokil Initial could
experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues (including as a result of current
global supply issues affecting microchips and printed circuit boards), which could result in out-of-stock
conditions, and its results of operations and relationships with customers could be adversely affected (a) if
new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by Rentokil Initial, government or industry
regulations or customers, (b) if Rentokil Initial is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality
and price
51 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
levels needed for its business, or (c) if any of Rentokil Initial’s key suppliers becomes insolvent, ceases or
significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress.
Rentokil Initial’s inability to fully or substantially meet customer demand due to supply chain issues could
result in, among other things, unmet consumer demand leading to reduced preference for Rentokil Initial’s
products or services in the future, customers purchasing products and services from competitors as a result
of such shortage of products, strained customer relationships, termination of customer contracts, additional
competition and new entrants into the market, and loss of potential sales and revenue, which could
adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects.
Weakening general economic conditions, including rising unemployment or decreased consumer confidence or
spending levels, especially as they may affect demand from Rentokil Initial’s customers, may adversely impact its
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Ongoing volatility in the global economic environment has led to, and may continue to lead to, economic
challenges such as low gross domestic product growth in regional and national economies, high volatility in
commodity prices and exchange rates and efforts made by governments to increase the minimum wage
across markets, as well as wide variations in local market prices and cost inflation across the globe. This may
be exacerbated by economic uncertainty caused by geopolitical events, political instability and civil unrest in
some local markets, catastrophic business events, including the continuation and/or broadening of the
conflict in the Ukraine and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further economic slowdown in the markets
in which Rentokil Initial operates may lead to a reduction in the level of demand from its customers for
existing and new services. Low-growth economies with inherent cost inflation may make it difficult for
Rentokil Initial to maintain profitability if it has weak pricing power in those markets, in particular, if there are
strong competitive pressures. Furthermore, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of
customers not renewing contracts or seeking to reduce prices leading to a reduction in profit margins and
cash flows or being unable to pay for existing or additional services leading to an increase in bad debts. Any
of these events could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial may not successfully implement its business strategies, including achieving its growth objectives.
Rentokil Initial may not be able to fully implement its business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within
the expected time frames, the anticipated benefits of various growth or other initiatives. Rentokil Initial’s
ability to implement its business strategy may be adversely affected by factors that Rentokil Initial cannot
currently foresee, such as unanticipated costs and expenses, technological change, severe economic
downturn (including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the conflict in Ukraine), the
level of interest rates, foreign exchange risks, failure to integrate acquisitions, a decline in the effectiveness
of Rentokil Initial’s marketing (including digital marketing) activities or disruptions in the supply chain. All of
these factors may necessitate changes to Rentokil Initial’s business strategy or adversely affect its business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
In addition, Rentokil Initial will incur certain costs to achieve efficiency improvements, systems
implementations and growth in Rentokil Initial’s business, and Rentokil Initial may not meet anticipated
implementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs. As these efficiency improvements, system
implementations and growth initiatives are implemented, Rentokil Initial may not fully achieve expected cost
savings and efficiency improvements, system implementations or growth rates, or these initiatives could
adversely impact customer retention or its operations. Also, Rentokil Initial’s business strategies may
change in light of its ability to implement new business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic
uncertainties or developments or other factors.
Rentokil Initial’s continued growth depends on its ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.
Rentokil Initial’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to retain existing customers and attract new
customers. There can be no assurance that Rentokil Initial’s strategy of using new technology and improved
sales techniques to attract profitable new clients, up-selling and cross-selling to existing clients and
focusing on retaining profitable business when renewing existing consumer contracts will be successful.
Moreover,
52 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
failure to maintain customer service, client management and sales capability, failure to adapt to local
business and consumer needs and/or failure to win and retain profitable customers in the face of competition
from competitors with lower costs or which are willing to accept lower margins may have a material adverse
effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Rentokil
Initial must be sufficiently agile to develop and deliver products and services that meet local market needs. If
Rentokil Initial is not able to adapt to local business and consumer needs, its existing customers may choose
not to renew contracts, reduce the use of Rentokil Initial’s services across their operations or seek
reductions in prices.
Rentokil Initial must continue to develop products and services that meet the needs and expectations of its
customer base, including to ensure the continued efficacy of its products in the target pest population.
Furthermore, as technological developments disrupt the markets in which Rentokil Initial operates and
changes service offerings across its industries, Rentokil Initial may need to develop new products and
services. In the future, products and services may interact with each other in new ways and offer new
capabilities to consumers, such as systems that are networked and able to be monitored in real time. Rentokil
Initial’s competitors may be earlier to embrace these new technological developments that are disruptive to
the market or to develop more effective products, and a delay in Rentokil Initial’s response may lead to
adverse effects to its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial’s industries are highly competitive.
Rentokil Initial competes with a wide variety of competitors of varying sizes and faces competition in many
of the markets in which it operates. The growing presence of multinational competitors may increase the cost
of acquisitions and/or drive down prices, impacting Rentokil Initial’s profitability. Furthermore, the increased
presence of facilities management companies in the markets in which Rentokil Initial operates may also drive
down prices and adversely impact the quality of relationships with end customers. The principal methods of
competition in Rentokil Initial’s business include quality and speed of customer service, brand awareness
and reputation, effective use of technology and systems, customer satisfaction, fairness of contract terms
(including price and promotions), professional sales forces and referrals. Rentokil Initial may be unable to
compete successfully against current or future competitors, and the competitive pressures that Rentokil
Initial faces may result in reduced market share, reduced pricing or an adverse impact on its reputation,
business, results of operations and financial condition.
Cybersecurity breaches, attacks and other similar incidents, as well as disruptions or failures in Rentokil Initial’s IT
systems or data security procedures and those of its third-party service providers, could expose Rentokil Initial to
liability, limit its ability to effectively monitor, operate and control operations and adversely impact its business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial’s business is dependent on effective IT systems and data security procedures. Rentokil Initial
and its third-party service providers may be subject to significant system or network disruptions from
numerous causes, including cybersecurity breaches, attacks or other similar incidents, facility access issues,
new system implementations, human error, fraud, theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a
similar catastrophic event. Moreover, computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware, phishing, spoofing,
malicious or destructive code, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, and other cyberattacks have
become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. Because the techniques used by computer hackers
and others to access or sabotage networks and computer systems constantly evolve and generally are not
recognized until launched against a target, Rentokil Initial and its third-party service providers may be
unable to anticipate, detect, react to, counter or mitigate against all of these techniques or remediate any
resulting incident. Cybersecurity risk has increased due to increased online and remote activity (a trend
accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic) and Rentokil Initial experienced a notable increase in the number and
seriousness of cyberattacks, including repeated distributed denial of service attacks and attempted
ransomware incidents in countries such as Brazil and Italy. The attacks were detected and prevented before
they were able to have a material impact on the business, but it is possible that future cyberattacks could
avoid detection or prevention and have such a material impact.
Any IT system disruptions or breaches may lead to unauthorized release of data and inefficient business
operations, including poor supply chain management, and have a negative impact on customer
53 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
service, resulting in a loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s
business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance
its protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities, breaches, attacks or
other similar incidents. Any cybersecurity incident, attack or other similar incident, or its failure to make
adequate or timely disclosures to the public, regulators, or law enforcement agencies following any such
event, could harm Rentokil Initial’s competitive position, result in violations of applicable data privacy or
cybersecurity laws or regulations, result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of threat
mitigation and detection processes and procedures, cause disruption to business activities, divert
management attention and other resources or otherwise adversely affect the internal operations and
reputation of Rentokil Initial, degrade financial results, cause it to incur significant costs to remedy the
damages caused by the incident or defend legal claims, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and
expose Rentokil Initial to civil litigation, fines, damages or injunctions. With respect to cybersecurity-related
legal claims and regulatory scrutiny, Rentokil Initial also may incur additional costs related to the diverse set
of laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject across multiple jurisdictions. See also “Risk Factors - 
Risks Related to Rentokil Initial’s Business - Rentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex
and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual
obligations, relating to data privacy and security. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these
requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business.”
Extraordinary events may significantly impact Rentokil Initial’s business if it is unable to ensure business continuity
due to a material incident.
The ability to service customers without interruption is essential to Rentokil Initial’s operations.
Contingency plans are required to continue or recover operations following a disruption or incident. Such
incidents may include (a) the loss or insolvency of a major distributor, (b) repeated or prolonged government
shutdowns or similar events, (c) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact Rentokil Initial’s
markets), (d) natural or man-made disasters, (e) water shortages, (f) cybersecurity, IT or privacy-related
incidents or (g) severe weather conditions affecting Rentokil Initial’s operations or the food service,
hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business. Inability to
restore or replace critical capacity to an agreed level within an agreed time frame would prolong the impact of
such disruption or incident and could lead to, among other things, negative publicity and reputational
damage and could severely affect Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial has independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have an adverse effect on
Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Government shutdowns can have a material adverse effect on operations or cash flows by disrupting or
delaying new product launches, renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or
export licenses for raw materials or products.
War (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or man-made disasters, water shortages or severe
weather conditions affecting the food service, hospitality, travel and other industries can cause a downturn
in the business of Rentokil Initial’s customers, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on Rentokil
Initial’s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Hurricanes or other severe weather
events impacting the local markets could materially and adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s ability to obtain
raw materials at reasonable cost, or at all, and could adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s business. The health
and safety of Rentokil Initial’s colleagues in local markets could be harmed by the detrimental effects of
natural and man-made disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are
material to its business.
Rentokil Initial’s ability to compete effectively depends in part on its ability to obtain, maintain, protect,
defend and enforce its intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including the service marks,
trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights Rentokil Initial owns or licenses,
54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
particularly its brand names, including Rentokil, Initial, Ambius, Steritech, JC Ehrlich, Presto-X, Western
Exterminator, Florida Pest Control, Eradico, Cannon, Sanitact, Ultraprotect, PestConnect, HygieneConnect,
Entotherm, Calmic, Turf Fuel, Lumnia, Luminos, SOLitude, Batzner, Medentex, OnBrand360, Peter Cox,
Environmental Pest Service, Pestfree365, Activap, Prokill, Micronclean and Microfresh. Rentokil Initial has
not sought to register or protect all of its intellectual property, including its trademarks, either in the UK, U.S.
or in every jurisdiction in which they are or may be used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign
trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws, Rentokil Initial may not receive the same protection in
other countries as it would in the UK or the U.S.
If Rentokil Initial is unable to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including brand
names, it could cause a material adverse impact on its business, reputation, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects. Litigation may be necessary to enforce Rentokil Initial’s intellectual property
rights and protect its proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that its products,
services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.
Rentokil Initial relies on third parties, including third-party vendors for business process outsourcing initiatives,
investment counterparties, and franchisees. Any termination or disruption of such relationships or counterparty
default or litigation could have a material adverse effect on its business.
Rentokil Initial’s strategy to increase profitability, in part, by reducing its costs of operations, and to mitigate
and manage its exposure to financial risk, includes the implementation of certain business process
outsourcing initiatives and entry into arrangements with investment counterparties, including lenders,
insurers and derivative counterparties. As such, Rentokil Initial is exposed to counterparty risk. Any
disruption, termination or substandard performance of these outsourced services, including possible
breaches by third-party vendors of their agreements with Rentokil Initial, or the failure of counterparties to
discharge all or part of their obligations (including, for example, due to the deterioration of a counterparty’s
actual or perceived creditworthiness) could adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s reputation, customer and
colleague relationships, results of operations and financial condition. Also, to the extent a third-party
outsourcing provider or counterparty relationship is terminated, there is a risk of disputes or litigation and
that Rentokil Initial may not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider in a timely
manner or on terms that Rentokil Initial considers favorable, and even if Rentokil Initial finds an alternate
provider, or chooses to insource such services or activities, there are significant risks associated with such
transition.
In addition, to the extent Rentokil Initial decides to terminate outsourcing services and insource such
services, there is a risk that Rentokil Initial may not have the capabilities to perform these services internally,
resulting in a disruption to Rentokil Initial’s business, which could adversely impact its business, reputation,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Rentokil Initial could incur costs, including
personnel and equipment costs, to insource previously outsourced services like these, and these costs
could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.
Third-party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees are independent third parties that Rentokil
Initial does not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. If third
party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in
a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, Rentokil Initial could be subject to claims
from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party distributors, subcontractors,
vendors and franchisees. In addition, Rentokil Initial’s relationship with third-party distributors,
subcontractors, vendors and franchisees could become strained (including resulting in litigation) and these
strains in relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial’s business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business and reputation.
Rentokil Initial is not currently required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and is therefore not required to
evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. However, following its U.S. listing
and SEC registration, beginning as of the year ended December 31, 2023, Rentokil Initial will be required to
55

•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and its independent auditor will be
required to audit management's assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting.
While Rentokil Initial has yet to design and establish an internal control over financial reporting framework
for the purposes of the effectiveness evaluation described above, Rentokil Initial has undertaken a
preliminary assessment of its controls in connection with the preparation of the registration statement, of
which this prospectus forms a part. In addition, during the preparation of its 2021 financial statements,
Rentokil Initial identified errors to its 2020 and 2019 financial statements which resulted in restatements of
those periods. As a result of both the preliminary assessment and the restatements, Rentokil Initial identified
the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting:
a lack of sufficient resources with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge,
particularly for non-routine transactions, combined with incomplete policies and procedures related
to the segregation of duties and control activities required for accurate and timely financial
accounting, reporting, and disclosures in accordance with the financial reporting requirements set
forth by the SEC; and
a failure to design and maintain effective IT controls over user access, change management, database
management and segregation of duties for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of
its financial statements.
Though Rentokil Initial has started to design remediation measures in respect of these material weaknesses,
it has not yet implemented or tested the effectiveness of the remediation measures. Moreover, Rentokil Initial
cannot be certain that it will not identify other material weaknesses in its internal control over financial
reporting as it designs, implements and tests its internal control over financial reporting framework in
anticipation of its initial effectiveness evaluation. Moreover, when Rentokil Initial evaluates the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in connection with its annual report for the year
ended December 31, 2023, there can be no guarantee that Rentokil Initial or its independent auditor will not
identify other material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.
If Rentokil Initial fails to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could
suffer material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements, fail to meet its reporting obligations or
fail to prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information and
subject Rentokil Initial to potential delisting from the stock exchange, regulatory investigations and civil or
criminal sanctions.
Rentokil Initial may be required to recognize impairment charges or be subject to asset revaluations or downgrades.
Rentokil Initial has significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, such as customer lists. In
accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test annually, or more
frequently if there are indicators of impairment, including:
observable indications that the asset’s value has declined significantly more than would be expected
as a result of the passage of time or normal use;
significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity that have taken place, or will take place in the
near future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates,
or in the market to which an asset is dedicated;
market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased, and those
increases are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value in use and decrease
the asset’s recoverable amount materially;
the carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalization;
evidence that there is obsolescence or physical damage of the asset;
significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity that have taken, or are expected to take place
in the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be
56 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
used. These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the
operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected
date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite; and
indication that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.
Based upon future economic and financial market conditions, the operating performance of Rentokil Initial
and other factors, including those listed above, Rentokil Initial may incur impairment charges in the future,
including in relation to the transaction in respect of goodwill created and the value at which assets were
recognized at completion. It is possible that such impairment, if required, could be material. Any future
impairment charges that Rentokil Initial is required to record could have a material adverse impact on its
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Risks Relating to Legal and Compliance Matters
Government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s
financial results.
As a global company, Rentokil Initial is subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the
countries in which it conducts business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-
bribery or anti-corruption, consumer protection, product liability, environmental, health and safety,
intellectual property, data privacy or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions.
If Rentokil Initial is unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact its reputation
and business results. Rentokil Initial cannot provide assurance that its internal control policies and
procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect it from acts committed by Rentokil
Initial’s colleagues or agents. While it is Rentokil Initial’s policy and practice to comply with all legal and
regulatory requirements applicable to its business, a finding that Rentokil Initial is in violation of, or out of
compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject it to civil remedies, including fines, damages,
injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s
business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Even if a claim is
unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions
regarding Rentokil Initial’s products, processes or business practices could adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s
reputation and brand image.
In addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which Rentokil Initial does
business, which could adversely impact its financial results. For example, new legislation or regulations may
result in increased costs to Rentokil Initial, directly for its compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers
increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or the reduced
availability of raw materials.
Following completion of the transaction, approximately 60% of the combined company’s total revenues is
expected to come from North America and therefore the combined company may face increased exposure to
potential future claims or litigation given the more litigious nature of the U.S. market, including increased
exposure to injunctive relief or damages granted by courts in respect of such claims, and regardless of the
outcome of any litigation or claims, the combined company may incur additional costs in defending against
such claims following completion of the transaction. An unfavorable outcome or settlement in any litigation
may have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business, reputation, results of operations financial
condition and/or prospects.
Termite damage claims and lawsuits related thereto could increase Rentokil Initial’s legal expenses and may
adversely impact its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Following consummation of the transaction, Rentokil Initial’s business may become subject to a significant
number of damage claims related to termite activity in homes/commercial premises, often accompanied by a
termite damage warranty/guarantee. Currently Terminix is subject to a significant number of damage claims
related to its termite control services and termite damage warranties/guarantees. Damage claims may include
circumstances when a customer notifies Rentokil Initial that they have experienced
57 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
damage and Rentokil Initial reaches an agreement to remediate that damage (a “Non-litigated Claim”); and
circumstances when a customer directly initiates litigation or arbitration proceedings or when Rentokil Initial
does not reach an agreement with a customer to remediate the damage and that customer initiates litigation
or arbitration proceedings (a “Litigated Claim”). Some plaintiffs bringing Litigated Claims may seek to
demonstrate a pattern and practice of fraud in connection with Litigated Claims and may seek awards, in
addition to repair costs, which include punitive damages and damages for mental anguish. Rentokil Initial
intends to defend these Litigated Claims vigorously, and Rentokil Initial intends to take decisive actions to
mitigate increasing claims costs; however, Rentokil Initial cannot give assurance that these mitigating
actions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can it give assurance that lawsuits or
other proceedings related to termite damage claims will not materially affect its business, reputation, results
of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
In April 2021, the State of Mississippi brought litigation against Terminix related to its termite inspection and
treatment practices (the “Mississippi Litigation”). Terminix disputes the claims made in the Mississippi
Litigation and intends to defend the matter vigorously. However, given the uncertainty of litigation, the
preliminary stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for success on the merits, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the Mississippi Litigation. The combined company intends
to defend the Litigated Claims, including the Mississippi Litigation, vigorously, and intends to take action to
mitigate increasing claims costs; however, Rentokil Initial cannot give assurance that these mitigating
actions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can it give assurance that lawsuits or
other proceedings related to termite damage claims will not materially affect its business, reputation, results
of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Following the completion of the transaction, the combined company’s business may also become subject to
state regulator claims related to trade practices, including termite renewal pricing, inspection and treatment
practices (a “Regulator Claim”). Terminix has been subject to such claims in the past and has entered into
settlements, for example with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Alabama (the “AL AG”) and
other Alabama state regulators. The combined company intends to defend any Regulator Claims and intends
to take action to mitigate claims costs; however, Rentokil Initial cannot give assurance that these mitigating
actions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can it give assurance that lawsuits or
other proceedings related to trade practices will not materially affect its business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Compliance with, or violation of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws pertaining
to the use of pesticides, could result in significant costs that adversely impact Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
The pest control industry is subject to various laws and regulations regarding environmental and health and
safety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the
environment, the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances
and wastes, the impact of chemicals (including fumigant gases), as well as pesticide and biocide products, on
human health and safety and the environment, and the protection of the health and safety of its colleagues
and the public.
These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from,
present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by former sites or by prior owners or
operators of sites Rentokil Initial currently owns or operates. These laws and regulations can result in costs
associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up,
fines, penalties, orders requiring corrective action or suspending or otherwise impacting Rentokil Initial’s
operations or other sanctions if it is found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or
discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations.
Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations,
could impact the sales of some of Rentokil Initial’s products or services. In addition to an increase in costs
of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could
result in interruptions to Rentokil Initial’s business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses
should it be unable to meet the demands of its customers for products.
58 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Products used by Rentokil Initial containing pesticides generally must be registered with the relevant
governmental agencies or authorities before they can be sold or applied. The failure to obtain, or the
cancellation of, any such registration, or the withdrawal from the marketplace of such pesticides, could have
an adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, the severity of which would depend on the products
involved, whether other products could be substituted and whether competitors were similarly affected. The
pesticides Rentokil Initial uses are manufactured by independent third parties and are evaluated by the
relevant governmental authorities or agencies as part of its ongoing exposure risk assessment. Any of these
authorities or agencies may decide that a pesticide Rentokil Initial uses will be limited or will not be re-
registered for use in the relevant jurisdiction. Rentokil Initial plc cannot predict the outcome or the severity
of the effect of any particular authority’s or agency’s continuing evaluations. In addition, the use of certain
pesticide products is regulated by various international, national, federal, state, provincial and local
environmental and public health agencies and bodies. Some of Rentokil Initial’s products may also become
subject to bans or restrictions due to animal cruelty concerns. Given Rentokil Initial’s dispersed locations,
distributed operations and numerous colleagues and franchise associates, it may be unable to prevent
violations of these or other laws and regulations or misuse of products by colleagues or others from
occurring. Even if Rentokil Initial is able to comply with all such laws and regulations and obtain all
necessary registrations and licenses, the pesticides or other products Rentokil Initial applies or uses, or the
manner in which it applies or uses them, could be alleged to cause injury to the environment, to people or to
animals, or such products could be banned in certain circumstances. The laws and regulations may also
apply to third-party vendors who are hired to repair or remediate property and who may fail to comply with
environmental laws, health and safety laws and regulations and subject Rentokil Initial to risk of legal
exposure. The costs of compliance, non-compliance, investigation, remediation, combating reputational harm
or defending civil or criminal proceedings, products liability, personal injury or other lawsuits could have a
material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition
and/or prospects.
International, national, federal, state, provincial and local agencies and bodies regulate the disposal,
handling and storage of waste, discharges from Rentokil Initial’s facilities and the investigation and clean-up
of contaminated sites. Rentokil Initial could incur significant costs, including investigation and clean-up
costs, fines, penalties and civil or criminal sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and
personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations enforced by these
agencies and bodies. Liability under laws and regulations can be imposed on a joint and several basis and
without regard to fault or the legality of the underlying conduct. In addition, potentially significant
expenditures could be required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations,
including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
A violation of health and safety or environmental laws or regulations relating to Rentokil Initial’s operations
or a failure to comply with the instructions of relevant health and safety authorities, environmental agencies
or internal policies could lead to, among other things, personal injury, negative publicity and reputational
damage, fines, costly compliance procedures, litigation and withdrawal of licenses to operate. Such
violations could, therefore, have an adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Rentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in
many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. Any actual or perceived
failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business.
Rentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and
standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security.
Ensuring that its collection, use, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information complies
with such requirements can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services,
and reduce operational efficiency.
Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which Rentokil Initial operates has established its own data
privacy and security legal framework with which it must comply. The cost of compliance, and the potential
for fines and penalties for non-compliance, with data privacy and security laws and regulations may have a
significant adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition
and/or prospects.
59 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If Rentokil Initial is otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in
which it operates, it could affect the manner in which Rentokil Initial provides its services, the geographical
location or segregation of its relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect its financial
results. In addition, such procedures and controls, which Rentokil Initial operates to comply with relevant
data privacy and security requirements in the jurisdictions it operates, may not be effective in ensuring
compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data.
While Rentokil Initial strives to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate,
comprehensive and compliant with applicable laws, rules, regulations and industry standards, it cannot
ensure that its privacy policies and other statements regarding its practices will be sufficient to protect it
from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. Although
Rentokil Initial endeavors to comply with its privacy policies, Rentokil Initial may at times fail to do so or be
alleged to have failed to do so. If its public statements about its use, collection, disclosure and other
processing of personal information, whether made through its privacy policies, information provided on its
website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of its actual
practices, Rentokil Initial may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action.
Rentokil Initial’s compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws,
rules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or
inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. Any failure or
perceived failure by Rentokil Initial to comply with its privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and
security laws, rules, regulations, standards or contractual obligations, or a security breach that leads to theft
or other unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure,
release or transfer of personal information, including customer, colleague, supplier or Rentokil Initial’s
proprietary, sensitive or confidential data, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or
practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against it,
legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties,
sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). Any of the foregoing could lead to significant
reputational damage, distract management and technical personnel, increase its costs of doing business,
adversely affect the demand for its products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability,
any of which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.
Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes Rentokil
Initial pays and its profitability.
Rentokil Initial operates across many different tax jurisdictions and is subject to periodic tax audits which
sometimes challenge the basis on which local tax has been calculated and/or withheld. Successful challenges
by local tax authorities may have an adverse impact on profitability and cash flow. Unanticipated non-
compliance with relevant tax legislation and/or reporting requirements may result in material unprovided tax
charges relating to prior years which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s financial
condition and/or prospects.
The completion of the transaction will result in Rentokil Initial becoming subject to U.S. regulations which differ
from the regulations to which Rentokil Initial is currently subject. Current and future U.S. regulations could have an
adverse effect on the results of operations, business and financial position of Rentokil Initial following completion
of the transaction.
Following the completion of the transaction, as a result of the registration of Rentokil Initial ADSs with the
SEC, it is expected that Rentokil Initial will be subject to U.S. securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. These regulations are different from the regulations to which Rentokil Initial is currently subject and
therefore pose an increased compliance burden on Rentokil Initial and, particularly where supplemented by
new regulations, could lead to higher costs and greater complexity, and potential reputational damage,
regulatory sanctions or fines in connection with breach. Following the completion of the transaction, the
combined company could face increased exposure to other U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations
(including tax laws), including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, with respect to Rentokil
Initial’s worldwide activities, as a result of its increased presence in the U.S. The enactment
60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of unduly onerous and restrictive regulation may adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s share price and could
have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, business and/or financial condition of Rentokil
Initial.
As a “foreign private issuer”, Rentokil Initial plc would not be required to comply with all of the periodic
disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and governance requirements of the
NYSE that apply to a U.S. domestic issuer. It is possible that Rentokil Initial could lose foreign private issuer
status in the future. The determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business
day of an issuer’s second fiscal quarter. As such, Rentokil Initial will re-assess its status as a foreign private
issuer as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of 2023. Rentokil Initial would lose foreign
private issuer status if more than 50% of its common shares are directly or indirectly held by residents of the
United States and it fails to meet the additional requirements necessary to maintain its foreign private issuer
status. These additional requirements relate to the citizenship and residency of its directors and officers, the
location of its assets and whether its business is principally administered in the United States. If Rentokil
Initial ceases to be a foreign private issuer, it will be required to comply with reporting, disclosure,
compliance and governance requirements that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. This could result in
significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses, as well as increased demands on management’s
time.
Risks Relating to Financing
Adverse credit and financial market events and conditions could, among other things, impede access to or increase
the cost of financing, which could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial’s business, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Disruptions in credit or financial markets could make it more difficult for Rentokil Initial to obtain, or increase
its cost of obtaining, financing for its operations or investments or to refinance its indebtedness, or cause
lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and not give technical or other waivers under applicable
agreements governing such indebtedness to the extent Rentokil Initial may seek them in the future, thereby
causing it to be in default. There is no assurance that Rentokil Initial will be able to refinance or extend the
maturity of its indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to refinance Rentokil Initial’s
indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.
The agreements and instruments governing Rentokil Initial’s indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that
could impact Rentokil Initial’s ability to operate its business.
As of June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately £3.8 billion.
The agreement governing Rentokil Initial’s revolving credit facility maturing February 2027, which is
expected to increase to US$1 billion at closing (the “RCF”), the Bridge and Term Facilities Agreement and the
New Senior Notes contain undertakings that, collectively, among other things, restrict Rentokil Initial’s
ability to: (a) transfer or sell assets by way of a Class 1 transaction (as such term is defined in the FCA’s
Listing Rules); (b) create security over its assets in excess of a certain amount; (c) issue debt instruments at
subsidiary level in excess of a certain amount; and (d) issue trade instruments in excess of a certain amount.
Rentokil Initial’s ability to comply with the undertakings and restrictions contained in each of the agreements
governing the RCF, the Bridge and Term Facilities Agreement, the New Senior Notes and the instruments
governing its other indebtedness may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond its
control including credit or capital market disruptions. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions
could result in a default that would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders to declare all amounts
outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In any such case,
Rentokil Initial may be unable to borrow under the RCF and/or any such other facility and may not be able to
repay the amounts due under such facility or its other outstanding indebtedness. This could have materially
adverse consequences to Rentokil Initial’s (and with effect from completion of the transaction, the combined
company’s) business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects and could cause
it to become bankrupt or insolvent.
61 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to its debt securities by rating agencies may
increase Rentokil Initial’s future borrowing costs and reduce its access to capital.
Rentokil Initial’s indebtedness has primarily investment grade ratings, and any rating, outlook or watch
assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment,
current or future circumstances change relating to the basis of the rating, outlook or watch, such as adverse
changes to Rentokil Initial’s business. Any future lowering of its ratings, outlook or watch likely would make
it more difficult or more expensive for Rentokil Initial to obtain debt financing.
The additional indebtedness that Rentokil Initial will incur in connection with the completion of the transaction
could adversely affect the combined company’s financial position, including by decreasing Rentokil Initial’s, and
with effect from the consummation of the transaction, the combined company’s, business flexibility and result in a
decline in the combined company’s credit rating.
Following the consummation of the transaction, the combined company will have increased borrowings
compared to Rentokil Initial’s historic level of borrowings. Rentokil Initial’s consolidated borrowings were
approximately £3.8 billion (US$4.7 billion converted at the £:$ exchange rate on June 30, 2022) as of June 30,
2022.
Rentokil Initial may incur up to US$2.7 billion of additional debt in connection with the completion of the
transaction, of which approximately US$2 billion (as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus) has been
incurred. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Proposal - The Rentokil Initial Debt Financing” beginning on page 119. This increased level of borrowing
could have the effect, among other things, of reducing the combined company’s flexibility to respond to
changing business and economic conditions and will have the effect of increasing the combined company’s
interest expenses. In addition, the amount of cash required to service the combined company’s increased
borrowing levels and increased aggregate dividends following consummation of the transaction and thus the
demands on the combined company’s cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required
to service Rentokil Initial’s borrowings and pay dividends prior to the transaction. The increased levels of
borrowings and any dividends following consummation of the transaction could also reduce funds available
for the combined company’s investments in M&A, research and development, capital expenditures and other
activities and may create competitive disadvantages for the combined company relative to other companies
with lower debt levels.
Rentokil Initial’s credit rating impacts the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly,
Rentokil Initial’s cost of capital. Rentokil Initial’s credit rating reflects each credit rating organization’s
opinion of Rentokil Initial’s financial and business strength, operating performance and ability to meet its
debt obligations. Although Rentokil Initial’s credit rating was reaffirmed by S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) as
BBB following the announcement of the transaction, if Rentokil Initial’s (and with effect from the
consummation of the transaction, the combined company’s) credit rating declines, Rentokil Initial (and with
effect from the consummation of the transaction, the combined company) may not be able to sell additional
debt securities, borrow money, refinance the transaction facilities (if drawn) or establish alternatives to the
transaction facilities in the amounts or at the times or interest rates contemplated thereby (or at all), or upon
more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if Rentokil Initial’s current credit rating is
maintained.
The cost of certain of Rentokil Initial’s existing indebtedness will also increase in the event that Rentokil
Initial’s credit rating is sub-investment grade. In addition, future borrowings under circumstances in which
the combined company’s debt is rated below investment grade may contain further restrictions that impose
significant restrictions on the way the combined company operates following the transaction.
An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing Rentokil Initial’s debt and could adversely impact
its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
Facility B will bear interest at a floating rate. As a result, to the extent Rentokil Initial has not hedged against
rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase the cost of
servicing the debt in the future and could materially and adversely affect Rentokil Initial’s results of
operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, if Rentokil Initial refinances its
indebtedness and interest rates increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was
consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing debt would
increase, which could have a material adverse effect on Rentokil Initial’s business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in Section 27A
of the U.S. Securities Act, and Section 21E of the U.S. Exchange Act, as amended by the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can sometimes be identified by the use of
forward-looking terms such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “would,” “could,”
“potential,” “seeks,” “aims,” “projects,” “predicts,” “is optimistic,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,”
“targets,” “anticipates,” “continues” or other comparable terms or negatives of these terms, but not all
forward-looking statements include such identifying words. Forward-looking statements are based upon
current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
Rentokil Initial and Terminix can give no assurance that such plans, estimates or expectations will be
achieved and therefore, actual results may differ materially from any plans, estimates or expectations in such
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such

The market prices of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock and the Sterling-
U.S. Dollar exchange rate have fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and
will continue to fluctuate from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus to the date of the Terminix special
meeting and completion of the transaction, and the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (and
therefore Rentokil Initial ADSs) and the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate will continue to fluctuate after
completion of the transaction. No assurance can be given concerning the market prices of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock and the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate before
completion of the transaction or Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (and therefore Rentokil Initial ADSs) and the
Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate after completion of the transaction. The exchange ratio and per share cash
amount are both fixed in the merger agreement, but the market price of the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
(and therefore the value of the merger consideration when received by Terminix stockholders) upon
completion of the transaction could be greater than, less than or the same as shown in the table above.
Accordingly, Terminix stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares and shares of Terminix common stock when considering whether to vote for adoption of the
merger agreement.

A quorum of Terminix stockholders is necessary to conduct the Terminix special meeting. A quorum is the
presence in person (including virtually via the Internet) or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority of
the Terminix common stock entitled to vote at the Terminix special meeting. Shares of Terminix common stock
represented at the Terminix special meeting by attendance via the special meeting website or by proxy and
entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting,
will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. However, because all of the proposals for
consideration at the Terminix special meeting are considered “non-routine” matters under the NYSE rules (as
described below), shares held in “street name” will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining
the existence of a quorum unless the stockholder provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting
instructions for at least one of the proposals before the Terminix special meeting. If a quorum is not present
at the Terminix special meeting or if there are otherwise not sufficient votes at the time of the Terminix special
meeting to approve the merger proposal, the chairman of the Terminix special meeting may adjourn the
meeting (for additional information, see the section of this proxy statement/​prospectus entitled “The
Terminix Special Meeting - Adjournments” beginning on page 71).
Under the NYSE rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” on behalf of the
beneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain
“routine” proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However,
banks, brokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters
that, under the NYSE rules, as applicable, are “non-routine.” This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which
occurs on an item when (1) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or
more “routine” proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other
“non-routine” proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (2) the beneficial
owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter.
All of the proposals before the Terminix special meeting are considered “non-routine” matters under the
NYSE rules, and banks, brokers or other nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter
before the meeting. As a result, Terminix does not expect any broker non-votes at the Terminix special
meeting, and if you hold your shares of Terminix common stock in “street name,” your shares will not be
represented and will not be voted on any matter unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker
or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other
nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote on any of the proposals before the Terminix special
meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owners.",81,81

of its directors and executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Householding of Proxy Materials,"Householding of Proxy Materials
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by
delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for
companies. Terminix and some brokers “household” proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to
multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected
stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or Terminix that they or Terminix will be
householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until
you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer
to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish
to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares of Terminix common stock are held in a
brokerage account, or Terminix if you hold shares of Terminix common stock directly in your name. You may

entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page 328.
This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you as a stockholder of Terminix in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by the Terminix board of directors for use at the Terminix special meeting. At the
Terminix special meeting, Terminix is asking stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, pursuant to which (1) Merger Sub I will merge with and into Terminix with Terminix
surviving the first merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, and (2) immediately following the effective
time of the first merger, Terminix will merge with and into Merger Sub II with Merger Sub II surviving the
second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Rentokil Initial. Upon completion of the transaction, Terminix stockholders (other than holders of certain
excluded shares) will be entitled to receive, at the election of the holders of such shares and subject to
certain allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, either (1) a number of Rentokil Initial
ADSs (each representing a beneficial interest in five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) equal to (A) the
exchange ratio plus (B) the quotient of the per share cash amount and the Rentokil Initial ADS price or (2) an
amount in cash, without interest, and in U.S. dollars equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the
product of the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial ADS price.
The Terminix board of directors, after careful consideration, unanimously approved and declared advisable
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the transaction,
and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the transaction, are fair to and in the best interests of Terminix and its stockholders.
The Terminix board of directors accordingly unanimously recommends that Terminix stockholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement. The transaction and a summary of the terms of the merger agreement are
described in more detail in this section entitled “The Merger Proposal” beginning on page 73 and the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 131.
Terminix stockholders are encouraged to read the full text of the merger agreement, which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Terminix common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.
It is a condition to the completion of the transaction that Terminix stockholders approve the merger proposal.
Shares of Terminix common stock not present at the Terminix special meeting via the special meeting website

failure of any Terminix stockholder who holds their shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other

merger agreement or any Terminix stockholder, each share of Terminix common stock (other than excluded
shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holders of such shares,
but subject to certain proration procedures, either (1) a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs (each representing a
beneficial interest in five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) equal to (A) the exchange ratio plus (B) the
quotient of the per share cash amount and the Rentokil Initial ADS price or (2) an amount in cash, without
interest, and in U.S. dollars equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product of the exchange ratio
and the Rentokil Initial ADS price. Any Terminix stockholder who does not make an election will be deemed
to have made an election to receive the stock consideration.
The total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid under
the terms of the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual election preferences. The Rentokil
Initial ADSs issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE and are expected to trade
under the symbol “RTO.” Based on the number of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares outstanding on August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, we expect
that former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction would own Rentokil
Initial ADSs representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial, and
Rentokil Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 74.3% of the
outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial.
The value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of the
measurement day will be substantially the same. For example, as of July 15, 2022 (which date has been
selected solely for illustrative purposes), Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted share price was £5.0825
(expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar
exchange rate was 1.1855. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would be
$30.13 and, accordingly:
the per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $42.99 which is (A) $11.00, the
per share cash amount, plus (B) $31.99, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.13, the
Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date; and
the per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4270 (which
have an approximate value as of such date of $42.99) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)
0.3651, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.13, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as
of such date.
As a result, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per
share stock consideration was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. The consideration
to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, to automatic
adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy statement/​prospectus entitled
“The Merger Agreement  - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132 to ensure that the total amount of
cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the transaction equal the aggregate amount
agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of the
merger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - 
Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The market value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders will fluctuate with the market price of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and will not be known at the time that Terminix stockholders vote on the
transaction. Based on Rentokil Initial’s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day
average of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to
December 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was
approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock. As described in the prior paragraph, based on
Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted average share price and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in
each case, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was
approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. To further demonstrate how the implied value of
the merger consideration may fluctuate over time, we note that as of August 31, 2022 (the latest practicable
date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus), Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted share price was
£5.2331 (expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S.
Dollar exchange rate was 1.1638. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would
be $30.45 and, accordingly:
the per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $43.33 which is (A) $11.00, the
per share cash amount, plus (B) $32.33, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.45, the
Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date; and
the per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4231 (which
have an approximate value as of such date of $43.33) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)
0.3612, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.45, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as
of such date.
As a result, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per
share stock consideration was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock. The consideration
to be paid to Terminix stockholders is subject, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, to automatic
adjustment and proration in the manner described in the section of this proxy statement/​prospectus entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132 to ensure that the total amount of
cash paid and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs issued in the transaction equal the aggregate amount
agreed to in the merger agreement. For detailed illustrations of the potential allocation and proration of the
merger consideration, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - 
Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135.
The market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the merger consideration, could
be greater than, less than or the same as their market price or implied value, as applicable, on the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Terminix special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain
current market quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock before deciding
how to vote with respect to the merger proposal. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock
are traded on the LSE and the NYSE, under the symbols “RTO” and “TMX,” respectively. The price of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares is reported in pounds sterling.
Proration of the Merger Consideration
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the stock consideration is oversubscribed, then each
Terminix stockholder that either elected the stock consideration or failed to make a valid cash/stock election
will receive a prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs and an amount in cash in U.S. dollars (without
interest). Such cash amount will be equivalent to the value of the amount of stock consideration payable in
excess of the prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, with such stock consideration valued based on the
volume weighted average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial ADSs (measured based on the volume
weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by the number of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares underlying each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the measurement day.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the cash consideration is oversubscribed, then each
Terminix stockholder that elected the cash consideration will receive a prorated amount in cash (without
interest) in U.S. dollars (the “prorated cash amount”) and a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs with a value
equivalent to the amount of cash consideration owed in excess of the prorated cash amount. Such Rentokil
75 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Initial ADSs will be valued based on the volume weighted average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial
ADSs (measured using the volume weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by
the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the measurement
day.
The calculation of the prorated merger consideration in the event of oversubscription of either the stock
consideration or merger consideration is further discussed in the section of this proxy statement/​prospectus
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration” beginning on page 132. For detailed illustrations
of the potential allocation and proration of the merger consideration, see the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of Merger Consideration and
Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135.
Cash/Stock Election
At least 20 business days prior to the anticipated closing date, the form of election will be mailed to all
record holders of Terminix common stock as of September 6, 2022. The form of election will allow each
Terminix stockholder to specify the number of shares of Terminix common stock with respect to which such
holder elects to make a cash election or a stock election. The election must be made prior to the election
deadline. The election deadline will be 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is three business days
before the closing date. In connection with the anticipated completion of the transaction, the anticipated
election deadline for Terminix stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration they desire to receive in
the transaction has been set for 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6, 2022. If the closing date is delayed to a
subsequent date, the election deadline will be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Rentokil Initial and
Terminix will promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled election deadline.
To make a valid election, each record holder of Terminix common stock must submit a properly completed
form of election so that it is actually received by the exchange agent at its designated office at or prior to the
election deadline. A form of election must be properly completed and signed and accompanied by any
additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the form of election. After a valid election as
described in this paragraph has been made with respect to shares of Terminix common stock, no further
registration of transfers of such shares can be made on the stock transfer books of Terminix, unless and until
such election is properly revoked as described below.
Impact of Selling Terminix Common Stock as to Which a Cash/Stock Election Has Already Been Made
Terminix stockholders of record who have made a cash/stock election will be unable to sell or otherwise
transfer their shares of Terminix common stock after making such election, unless the cash/stock election is
properly revoked before such election deadline in accordance with the election procedures or unless the
merger agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.
Cash/Stock Election Revocation
Any record holder of Terminix common stock who has delivered a duly completed election form to the
exchange agent may, at any time prior to the election deadline, revoke such stockholder’s cash/stock election
by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline. Terminix stockholders will
not be entitled to revoke their cash/stock election following the election deadline, unless the merger
agreement is thereafter terminated. As a result, Terminix stockholders who have made a cash/stock election
will be unable to revoke such election or sell their shares of Terminix common stock during the period
between the election deadline and the date of completion of the transaction or termination of the merger
agreement.
Non-Electing Holders
Terminix stockholders who do not make a cash/stock election, whose election forms are not received by the
exchange agent by the election deadline, or whose cash/stock election was not otherwise properly made in
the determination of the exchange agent (or in the reasonable determination of Rentokil Initial, if the
exchange agent declines to make such determination), in each case, are deemed to have elected to receive the
stock consideration with respect to such holder’s shares of Terminix common stock.

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Background of the Transaction,"Background of the Transaction
As part of Terminix’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the
Terminix board of directors and senior management periodically review, consider and assess Terminix’s
operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those
strategic goals and plans. These reviews have included, among other matters, the consideration of potential
opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures and other financial and strategic
alternatives. Management also prepares a five-year strategy plan in the ordinary course (the “Terminix
strategy plan”) to facilitate these reviews, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Terminix
board of directors, that reflects management’s financial and business outlook for Terminix over a five-year
period.
In February and March of 2018, with the authorization of the Terminix board of directors and the assistance
of Terminix’s financial advisors, including Lazard, and its outside counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
(“Wachtell Lipton”), representatives of Terminix reached out to and met with representatives of Rentokil
Initial on two separate occasions to discuss the possibility of a merger transaction between the parties, to be
followed by a spin-off of the American Home Shield business to shareholders of both Terminix and Rentokil
Initial. Preliminary discussions followed. On May 4, 2018, Terminix and Rentokil Initial entered into a mutual
nondisclosure agreement containing customary standstill restrictions on both parties (which restrictions
would terminate in the event the other party entered into a definitive agreement for a merger with a third
party). These discussions terminated in June 2018 due to the fact that the parties could not reach a
preliminary agreement on the basic terms of a transaction, including with respect to structure and valuation.
Additionally, at that time, Terminix had substantially progressed the spin-off of its American Home Shield
business, as an alternative value-creating transaction for Terminix stockholders. As a result, the parties did
not exchange substantial due diligence information or otherwise advance negotiations on the financial,
structural or other material terms and conditions of a transaction at that time, and Terminix decided to
proceed with its previously announced spin-off of its American Home Shield business instead of further
exploring a potential transaction with Rentokil Initial. Terminix and Rentokil Initial had no further discussions
regarding a strategic combination of the two companies until October 2021. Prior to 2018, there were no
preexisting business relationships or substantive discussions between the two companies relating to any
potential transaction.
On October 1, 2018, Terminix completed the spin-off of its American Home Shield business. Thereafter, on
October 1, 2020, Terminix completed the sale of its ServiceMaster Brands businesses to an affiliate of
investment funds managed by Roark Capital Management LLC. These transactions enabled Terminix’s
transition to a singularly focused pest management company, rather than a diversified services provider, and
subsequently Rentokil Initial expressed renewed interest in a combination in October 2021.
On October 1, 2021, Andy Ransom, Rentokil Initial’s Chief Executive, separately contacted Naren K.
Gursahaney, Chairman of the Terminix board of directors, and on October 4, 2021, Brett T. Ponton, Terminix’s
Chief Executive Officer, to inquire as to whether Terminix would be amenable to discussing a potential
strategic combination with Rentokil Initial. Mr. Ransom indicated that Rentokil Initial could be in a position
to submit a formal proposal for a transaction in the coming weeks. The members of the Terminix board of
directors were subsequently notified of the inquiry, and Terminix management contacted representatives of
Lazard and Wachtell Lipton to discuss next steps.
On October 5, 2021, Messrs. Ransom and Ponton continued their discussion of a potential strategic
combination of Terminix and Rentokil Initial. Later, on October 10, 2021, Mr. Ransom shared with Mr. Ponton
a presentation providing an overview on Rentokil Initial, its business and other publicly available
background information.
On October 11, 2021, the Terminix board of directors convened a meeting, together with members of
management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
provided an overview of the Terminix board of directors’ duties with respect to the approach from Rentokil
77 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Initial, and representatives of Lazard reviewed preliminary financial analyses regarding Terminix based on,
among other factors, unaudited prospective Terminix financial information provided to Lazard on October 7,
2021 that Terminix management had prepared in the ordinary course as part of the Terminix strategy plan and
that had been reviewed by the Terminix board of directors on September 1, 2021 (the “September 2021
Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections”), and preliminary financial analyses regarding Rentokil
Initial. For more information regarding the September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix
projections, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Certain
Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,” beginning on page 100, and the table summarizing
the September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections beginning on page 103. The
Terminix board of directors discussed a range of potential responses to Mr. Ransom’s inquiry, and instructed
Mr. Ponton to contact Mr. Ransom to express Terminix’s willingness to consider a proposal for a transaction
from Rentokil Initial if it valued Terminix appropriately and provided an acceptable level of certainty of
completion. Mr. Ponton communicated the Terminix board’s message to Mr. Ransom, who stated his
expectation that Rentokil Initial would submit a formal proposal in the coming weeks.
On October 13, 2021, Mr. Ponton, Robert Riesbeck, Terminix’s Chief Financial Officer, and Dion Persson,
Senior Vice President, Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions of Terminix, had a call with Mr. Ransom, Stuart
Ingall-Tombs, Rentokil Initial’s Chief Financial Officer, and Chris Hunt, Rentokil Initial’s Group M&A
Director, to convey their interest in a potential transaction at an appropriate valuation and to discuss
Rentokil Initial’s view of the strategic benefits of a combination of the two companies’ businesses, which
benefits included Rentokil Initial’s views that a transaction would have compelling industrial logic as the
combined company would have a complementary residential and commercial pest services business and a
leading global footprint with strong route-density and a large customer base, and Rentokil Initial’s views that
a transaction would be highly synergistic, including with respect to operating costs, technology, corporate
and administrative matters, and procurement. Later, on October 13, 2021, Mr. Ransom shared with Mr. Ponton
a presentation summarizing Rentokil Initial’s view of such strategic benefits.
On October 14, 2021, the Terminix board of directors met with members of management and representatives of
Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. An update was provided regarding Mr. Ponton’s conversation with Mr. Ransom.
Representatives of Lazard then reviewed with the board a list of potential counterparties that could be
interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Terminix, including an industry participant (“Party A”) and
two private equity firms (“Party B” and “Party C”). The Terminix board of directors discussed various
considerations associated with reaching out to, and pursuing a transaction with, these parties, in addition to
continuing discussions with Rentokil Initial regarding a potential transaction.
On October 21, 2021, the Terminix board of directors, together with members of management and
representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton, held a meeting to further discuss the possibility of engaging
with Rentokil Initial and other third parties regarding a potential transaction. Representatives of Lazard
shared their preliminary perspectives on valuation and the financial aspects of a transaction with Rentokil
Initial based on, among other factors, an assumed amount of $175 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies
(sensitivity cases were included if estimated pre-tax cost synergies were increased or decreased by $25
million) and updated unaudited prospective Terminix financial information provided to Lazard on October 19,
2021 that Terminix management had prepared to reflect, among other factors, Terminix’s actual financial
results for the period from July 1, 2021 through August 31, 2021 (the “October 2021 Terminix management
unaudited Terminix projections”). For more information regarding the October 2021 Terminix management
unaudited Terminix projections, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Proposal - Certain Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 100, and the
table summarizing the October 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections beginning on page
103.
Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also discussed regulatory and other legal considerations pertinent to a
potential strategic combination. The Terminix board of directors considered these perspectives along with
the opportunities and risks associated with continuing to operate Terminix on a stand-alone basis and other
strategic alternatives. The Terminix board of directors also considered the possibility of contacting other
parties to ascertain their potential interest in a transaction with Terminix. These parties included Party
78 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A, Party B and Party C, who, in the judgment of management and Lazard (after considering the landscape of
potential financial and strategic parties, the likelihood of such parties’ interest in a potential transaction and
the industry in which Terminix operates), were the most likely parties, other than Rentokil Initial, who could
reasonably be expected to be interested in pursuing a transaction with Terminix, would not face significant
execution risk in consummating a transaction of scale and in the industry in which Terminix operates, had
sufficient expertise in the services industry such that a combination would make financial and strategic sense
for both parties, and would not introduce significant leak risk. The Terminix board of directors then
instructed management and representatives of Lazard to contact Party A, Party B and Party C to ascertain
their potential interest in a transaction, while continuing to engage in discussions with representatives of
Rentokil Initial. In light of the aforementioned considerations and the execution and leak risks associated
with a broader outreach effort, the Terminix board of directors determined not to contact other parties at the
time.
Shortly following the meeting, representatives of Lazard contacted representatives of Party A, Party B and
Party C to inquire as to their potential interest in a strategic transaction with Terminix. Representatives of
Party A and Party C expressed preliminary interest in a potential transaction, while Party B’s representatives
indicated shortly afterwards that they did not believe that Party B could make a proposal that would be
competitive on valuation and thus would not be interested in further exploring a transaction.
On October 29, 2021, Messrs. Ponton and Persson met with Mr. Ransom to discuss a potential transaction
between Terminix and Rentokil Initial. Mr. Ransom orally conveyed the terms of a proposal by Rentokil Initial
to acquire Terminix, a written copy of which was delivered to Messrs. Ponton and Persson after the
conclusion of the meeting. The proposal contemplated an implied purchase price of $54.00 per share of
Terminix common stock consisting of approximately 80% stock and 20% cash. The proposal also
contemplated that Terminix stockholders could elect to receive all cash or all stock merger consideration,
subject to proration in the event of oversubscription, and that the consummation of a transaction would not
be subject to any financing contingency. In addition, Mr. Ransom raised the possibility that a member of the
Terminix board of directors would be appointed to Rentokil Initial’s board of directors upon the closing of a
transaction. On the same day, Terminix and Party C entered into a nondisclosure agreement containing
customary standstill restrictions on Party C (which restrictions would terminate in the event Terminix entered
into a definitive agreement for a merger with a third party).
On November 2, 2021, representatives of Party A contacted Lazard to indicate that, after further
consideration of Party A’s strategic priorities and concerns over its ability to integrate the Terminix business
in light of those priorities, Party A was not interested in further exploring a potential strategic transaction
with Terminix. Shortly thereafter, the Terminix board of directors met with members of management and
representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. The Lazard representatives provided an overview of the terms
of Rentokil Initial’s proposal as well as an update on the status of Terminix’s outreach efforts to Party A,
Party B and Party C. The Terminix board of directors then instructed management and Lazard to communicate
to Rentokil Initial that the board appreciated the seriousness of Rentokil Initial’s proposal but was keenly
focused on deal certainty, upfront price and overall value creation for Terminix stockholders, and that
Terminix would be willing to share certain due diligence materials, subject to the execution of a mutually
acceptable confidentiality agreement, to enable Rentokil Initial to refine its assessment of the potential value
of a combination. Mr. Ponton subsequently contacted Mr. Ransom to convey the board’s message. The
Terminix board of directors also authorized management to continue outreach efforts with Party C.
On November 5, 2021, Terminix and Rentokil Initial entered into a mutual nondisclosure agreement
superseding (and which was substantially similar to) the nondisclosure agreement previously agreed to by
the parties on May 4, 2018. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Rentokil Initial began submitting due
diligence requests and, on November 9, 2021, the Terminix board of directors held a meeting at which
representatives of Lazard reported on the process for addressing these requests. In the following weeks
through December 8, 2021, and with the authorization of the Terminix board of directors, representatives of
Terminix provided Rentokil Initial with access to a virtual data room, hosted diligence sessions for the benefit
of Rentokil Initial and responded to numerous diligence requests and questions. Representatives of Rentokil
Initial also provided Terminix with access to a virtual data room containing various due diligence materials
and hosted due diligence sessions with representatives of Lazard and members of Terminix

TABLE OF CONTENTS
management, including a discussion between representatives of Lazard and Rentokil Initial’s financial
advisers, Barclays and Goldman Sachs International, regarding Wall Street research analyst financial
forecasts and consensus estimates relating to Rentokil Initial.
On November 10, 2021, Mr. Ponton along with other members of Terminix management hosted a management
presentation for the benefit of Party C at which they reviewed Terminix’s corporate strategy and business
and financial performance and addressed questions from representatives of Party C. Representatives of
Terminix also made due diligence materials available to representatives of Party C.
On November 16, 2021, the Terminix board of directors met to discuss the status of Terminix’s ongoing due
diligence discussions and workstreams, as well as an illustrative timetable for negotiating transaction
documents and announcing a transaction.
On November 18, 2021, representatives of Party C contacted Lazard to express that Party C was no longer
interested in pursuing a potential transaction with Terminix in light of concerns over execution risk and its
ability to make a proposal that would be competitive on valuation.
On November 19, 2021, representatives of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (“Davis Polk”), Rentokil Initial’s legal
counsel, circulated a draft merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. The draft reflected the
transaction and purchase price structure contemplated by Rentokil Initial’s October 29th proposal and
included, among other terms, a “fiduciary out” provision that would permit the board of directors of either
party to change its recommendation in the event such party received an alternative acquisition proposal from
a third party under certain circumstances, but without providing a right of either party to terminate the
agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition proposal, and also provided for an unspecified termination
fee amount payable by each party in the event of a change of recommendation or, in the case of Terminix, if
Terminix entered into a definitive agreement with a third party within 12 months following the termination of
the agreement in certain circumstances. The draft merger agreement also contemplated that one member of
the Terminix board of directors (to be designated by Rentokil Initial) would be appointed to Rentokil Initial’s
board of directors upon the closing of a transaction. The draft agreement noted that the terms of the parties’
respective obligations to obtain any regulatory approvals required for the consummation of a transaction
would be determined at a later time following further analysis and discussion.
On November 23, 2021, the Terminix board of directors convened a meeting, together with members of
management and representatives from Lazard and Wachtell Lipton. Management and representatives of
Lazard provided an update regarding the status of Terminix’s ongoing discussions with Rentokil Initial and
outreach efforts to Party C. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Terminix board of directors
the terms of the draft merger agreement provided by Davis Polk. The Terminix board of directors discussed,
among other things, the regulatory processes associated with a strategic combination and the merger
agreement’s provisions addressing deal certainty. The Terminix board of directors was of the view that, while
Rentokil Initial’s proposal was attractive from a financial perspective, management should seek to further
improve the financial and other terms of the transaction. After consideration of the feedback from Party A,
Party B and Party C and the aforementioned execution and leak risks associated with a broader outreach
effort, the Terminix board of directors decided not to contact any other parties with respect to a transaction
and directed management, in consultation with Lazard and Wachtell Lipton, to continue discussions with
Rentokil Initial to determine if the parties could reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms.
Through the subsequent two weeks, members of management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell
Lipton participated in multiple telephonic and in-person discussions with their respective counterparts at
Rentokil Initial and its legal and financial advisors regarding the open financial and legal points between the
parties. In addition, further revised drafts of the merger agreement were exchanged between Wachtell Lipton
and Davis Polk, which reflected a number of changes to the terms proposed in the draft merger agreement
circulated by Davis Polk on November 19, 2021, including the addition of a right by Terminix to terminate the
merger agreement in the event it received an alternative acquisition proposal from a third party under certain
circumstances. The parties also discussed the regulatory processes associated with a strategic combination
and the merger agreement provisions addressing deal certainty. Members of Terminix management, directly
and through representatives of Wachtell Lipton, proposed to Rentokil Initial a “hell or high water” framework
under which the parties would be required to take any and all actions
80 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
necessary to obtain any regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction, including any
divestitures of businesses, assets, properties or product lines of Terminix or Rentokil Initial. Representatives
of Rentokil Initial conveyed that Rentokil Initial was not prepared to agree to such an uncapped obligation.
On December 2, 2021, the Terminix board of directors met with members of management and representatives
from Lazard and Wachtell Lipton to discuss the status of negotiations with Rentokil Initial. Management
discussed the possibility of reaching out to Rentokil Initial to request that it increase its contemplated
implied purchase price (in light of the increase in the market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the
decrease in the market price of Terminix common stock that had taken place since Rentokil Initial’s October
29th proposal) and accept certain enhanced obligations to obtain any regulatory clearance required to effect
29th proposal) and accept certain enhanced obligations to obtain any regulatory clearance required to effect
the consummation of a transaction. The Terminix board of directors considered these perspectives and
directed management, together with Lazard and Wachtell Lipton, to seek the enhancements discussed by
management. Thereafter, members of management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton
engaged in further discussions with representatives of Rentokil Initial and its legal and financial advisors.
As an outcome of these discussions, representatives of Rentokil Initial agreed to increase the implied
purchase price to $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock (consisting of approximately 80% stock and
20% cash based on the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares at announcement) and to pay a termination
fee to Terminix in the event a governmental authority entered an order relating to antitrust laws prohibiting
the transaction or the parties failed to obtain required regulatory approvals under certain circumstances. The
only implied purchase prices formally offered by Rentokil Initial and reviewed by the Terminix board of
directors were the implied purchase price of $54.00 per share in its proposal of October 29, 2021 and
thereafter the implied purchase price of $55.00 per share in its proposal of December 2, 2021. The increase
came after discussions between the parties regarding several factors, including, among other things,
negotiation of the regulatory efforts covenant in the merger agreement and the fact that $54.00 per share was
less than Terminix’s 52-week trading high of $55.00. After several rounds of discussions, Rentokil Initial
representatives agreed to divestitures of businesses, assets, properties or product lines so long as they did
not, in the aggregate, generate total revenues in excess of 12.8% of Terminix’s total revenues in the calendar
year 2020.
A regular meeting of the Terminix board of directors was held on December 6, 2021, at which members of
management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton updated the board as to their recent
discussions with representatives of Rentokil Initial. The Terminix board of directors discussed, among other
things, the limitations proposed by Rentokil Initial on its obligation to undertake divestitures or other
remedies required to obtain regulatory clearance, and after consideration of the potential implications for
deal certainty as well as other potential risks and benefits of the transaction, the Terminix board of directors
determined to accept Rentokil Initial’s proposed limitation and directed management and Terminix’s advisors
to work with their counterparts at Rentokil Initial towards finalizing the terms of a transaction, with the goal
of announcing a signed merger agreement on December 14, 2021.
Over the next several days, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Davis Polk exchanged further revised
drafts of the merger agreement to reflect these and other changes. On December 10, 2021, the Terminix board
of directors met with members of management and representatives of Lazard and Wachtell Lipton to review
the terms of the proposed merger agreement and to further discuss the potential risks and opportunities
presented by the potential transaction. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed the fiduciary duties of
the Terminix board of directors, and representatives of Lazard presented their financial analyses in respect of
Terminix and Rentokil Initial and the financial aspects of a transaction based on, among other factors, further
updated unaudited prospective Terminix financial information provided to Lazard on December 7, 2021 that
Terminix management had prepared to reflect, among other factors, Terminix’s actual financial results for the
period from September 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021 (the “December 2021 Terminix management
unaudited Terminix projections”). For more information regarding the December 2021 Terminix management
unaudited Terminix projections, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Proposal - Certain Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 100, and the

At a special meeting held on December 13, 2021, the Terminix board of directors unanimously: (1) determined
that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the
transaction) were fair to and in the best interests of Terminix and its stockholders; (2) approved, adopted and
declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
(including the transaction); (3) recommended the adoption by Terminix’s stockholders of the merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS
meeting of Terminix’s stockholders. Accordingly, the Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends
that Terminix stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
In evaluating the proposed transaction, reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the
Terminix board of directors consulted with Terminix senior management and its outside legal and financial
advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following factors that weighed in favor of the
transaction:
Strategic Considerations and Synergies
that combined, the Terminix and Rentokil Initial businesses will become the leading global pest
control company, with a customer base of approximately 4.9 million customers, approximately 56,000
colleagues globally and presence in 790 locations in over 88 countries;
that the combination will create substantially increased scale in North America, which will enable
further investments in people, service quality, innovation, digital technology and applications and
sustainability, to meet the future needs of customers and colleagues;
that the combination will create a company with an attractive financial profile (with estimated pro
forma EBITDA margins, including run-rate synergies, and an estimated multi-year compound annual
EBITDA growth rate superior to that of peers as well as Terminix and Rentokil Initial on a stand-alone
basis), and significant synergy opportunities that may be realized by bringing together two
complementary businesses with a strong operational and cultural fit, reducing costs, and driving
operational efficiencies, as described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Merger Proposal - Background of the Transaction” beginning on page 77, in particular the
description of the Terminix management assumed cost synergies discussed on page 101, and that
Terminix stockholders will be able to participate in such benefits as stockholders of the combined
company;
that the combined company will have the scale, balance sheet strength, financial flexibility, and free
cash flow to fund future growth, and improved ability to access the capital markets on more favorable
terms, which will allow the combined company to be more competitive in capturing strategic
opportunities;
that the transaction is expected to be mid-teens percent accretive to Rentokil Initial’s earnings per
share in the first full year following closing, as determined by calculating Rentokil Initial’s expected
2023 earnings per share following consummation of the transaction, accounting for the expected
synergies and various transaction-related adjustments, and comparing the result to Rentokil Initial’s
expected 2023 earnings per share absent consummation of the transaction, and that Terminix
stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs will be able to participate in such benefits as
stockholders of the combined company, subject to the risk factors discussed in the section of the
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 37, in particular the risk factor
describing the risks relating to accretion and dilution discussed on page 41;
information and discussions with Terminix’s management, in consultation with Lazard, regarding
Rentokil Initial’s business, results of operations, financial and market position, and Terminix
management’s expectations concerning the combined company’s business, financial prospects and
synergies, and historical and current trading prices of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares;
Attractive Value and Mix of Consideration
the aggregate value and nature of the consideration to be received in the merger by Terminix
stockholders, including:
that the merger consideration had an implied value per share of Terminix common stock of
approximately $55.00, consisting of (i) the cash consideration of $11.00 per share of Terminix
common stock and (ii) an implied value of the stock consideration of approximately $44.00 per
share, which is calculated based on (x) an exchange ratio of 5.3094 shares of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares (in the form of 1.0619 Rentokil Initial ADS based on 5:1 ratio of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares to each Rentokil Initial ADS) for one share of Terminix common stock, (y) the
average of the volume weighted average trading prices of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares

on each of the five consecutive trading days ending on December 10, 2021 of £6.27 and (z) an
exchange rate of 1 GBP to 1.3225 USD based on the average GBP to USD exchange rates on each
of the five consecutive trading days ending on December 10, 2021, which represented a premium
of approximately 47.0% to Terminix stockholders based on the closing price of Terminix common
stock on December 13, 2021 and a premium of approximately 32.5% based on the 90-day volume
weighted average share price of Terminix common stock as of the same date;
that approximately 80% of the merger consideration consists of Rentokil Initial ADSs, which
offers Terminix stockholders the opportunity, subject to proration, to participate in the future
earnings, dividends and growth of the combined company, which the Terminix board of directors
considers to be an attractive investment for the reasons discussed above in this section under “-
Strategic Considerations and Synergies”;
that approximately 20% of the merger consideration consists of cash, which provides certain
electing Terminix stockholders with immediate liquidity, subject to proration, which consideration
offered a premium valuation;
that the stock/cash election mechanism in the merger agreement offers Terminix stockholders the
opportunity to seek their preferred form of consideration, subject to proration, with an
equalization mechanic intended to ensure that the value of each election choice will be
substantially the same as of shortly prior to the consummation of the merger;
that the first merger and the second merger, taken together, are intended to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, as more fully described in the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 121;
Most Attractive Strategic Alternative
the view of the Terminix board of directors that the proposed transaction with Rentokil Initial was the
most attractive strategic alternative available to Terminix and its stockholders, including in
comparison to the alternative of remaining independent and continuing to execute on Terminix’s long-
term business strategy. In this regard, the Terminix board of directors considered:
that, in an effort to determine its respective interest in engaging in a strategic transaction with
Terminix, and at the direction of the Terminix board of directors, Lazard contacted an industry
participant and two private equity firms that, in the judgment of management and Lazard, were
the most likely parties, other than Rentokil Initial, who could reasonably be expected to be
interested in pursuing a transaction with Terminix and would not face significant execution risk in
consummating a transaction while also not otherwise introducing significant leak risk, and
Terminix thereafter provided diligence information to one of these parties, but ultimately none of
these parties determined to pursue a potential transaction with Terminix;
its belief, based on positions taken by Rentokil Initial during negotiations and the significant
premium relative to the stand-alone price of Terminix’s common stock, that the merger
consideration was the maximum consideration that Rentokil Initial would be willing to offer;
its belief that entering into the merger agreement with Rentokil Initial provided the best
alternative for maximizing stockholder value reasonably available to Terminix and its
stockholders, including when compared to continuing to operate on a stand-alone basis and
taking into account certain risks associated with continuing to operate as a stand-alone
company, including industry competition, challenges achieving growth objectives, ongoing labor
shortages, and other risk factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Terminix’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, and other documents that are incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The limited interest shown by the potential
alternative strategic and financial partners and their views on valuation further indicated to the
Terminix board of directors the challenges inherent in, and time required, to create comparable

TABLE OF CONTENTS
shareholder value through the continued operation of Terminix on a stand-alone basis, and the
relative attractiveness of the offer presented by Rentokil Initial;
that Terminix stockholders would have the opportunity to participate in the long-term value-
creation potential of Rentokil Initial after giving effect to the transaction;
Opinion of Terminix’s Financial Advisor
the financial presentation by Lazard and the oral opinion of Lazard rendered to the Terminix board of
directors, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 13, 2021, to the
effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in Lazard’s
written opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of Terminix common stock (other than
holders of certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) in the transaction was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the section
entitled “The Merger Proposal - Opinion of Terminix’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 89;
Likelihood of Completion of the Transaction
the likelihood that the transaction will be completed, based on, among other things, the limited
closing conditions to the completion of the transaction, the absence of a financing condition or
similar contingency that is based on Rentokil Initial’s ability to obtain financing and the commitment
made by Rentokil Initial to take certain actions if required to obtain regulatory approvals, as further
described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal -
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction” beginning on page 112;
Favorable Terms of the Merger Agreement
the ability of Terminix to, subject to specified limitations, respond to and engage in discussions
regarding unsolicited third-party acquisition proposals under certain circumstances and, ultimately, to
terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior
proposal to the merger with Rentokil Initial, subject to compliance with the procedural terms and
conditions set forth in the merger agreement and the payment of a termination fee of $200 million, as
further discussed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 160;
the terms of the merger agreement that restrict Rentokil Initial’s ability to solicit alternative business
combination transactions and to provide information to, or engage in discussions with, a third party
interested in pursuing an alternative business combination transaction with Rentokil Initial, as further
discussed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation” beginning on page 150;
the obligation of Rentokil Initial to pay Terminix by way of compensation a termination payment of
$150 million upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, as further
discussed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement -
Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 160;
the obligation of Rentokil Initial to pay Terminix by way of compensation a termination payment of
$50 million upon the termination of the merger agreement as a result of Rentokil Initial’s failure to
obtain the requisite Rentokil Initial shareholder approval of the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement and other related matters;
Governance Matters
the fact that, at the effective time of the first merger, one Terminix director will be appointed to the
Rentokil Initial board of directors (to be mutually agreed by Terminix and Rentokil Initial prior to the
closing), which will allow for oversight of and input into the strategy of the combined company;
The Terminix board of directors weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the transaction, including:
85

• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs that would be issued in the transaction would not
be adjusted to compensate for changes in the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares prior to the
consummation of the transaction. The Terminix board of directors determined that the exchange ratio
on the basis of which Rentokil Initial ADSs would be issued was appropriate and that the risks were
acceptable in view of the relative historical trading values and financial performance of Terminix and
Rentokil Initial;
the terms of the merger agreement that restrict Terminix’s ability to solicit alternative acquisition
proposals and to provide information to, or engage in discussions with, a third party interested in
pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal, as further discussed in the section of this proxy
statement/​prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation” beginning on page 150;
the potential for diversion of management attention and employee attrition due to the possible effects
of the announcement and pendency of the transaction and the potential effects on customers and
business relationships as a result of the transaction;
the interim operating covenants in the merger agreement that restrict Terminix’s ability to operate its
business and engage in strategic initiatives, and the amount of time it could take to complete the
transaction, including the fact that completion of the transaction depends on factors outside of
Terminix’s control, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions to the transaction will be
satisfied even if the merger proposal is approved by Terminix stockholders;
the possibility of non-consummation of the transaction, including due to a failure to obtain required
regulatory clearance, and the potential consequences of non-consummation, including the potential
negative impacts on Terminix, its business and the trading price of its shares of common stock;
the difficulty and costs inherent in integrating large and diverse businesses and the risk that the
potential synergies, dividend growth and other benefits expected to be obtained as a result of the
transaction might not be fully or timely realized;
the obligation of Terminix to pay Rentokil Initial by way of compensation a termination payment of
$200 million upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances;
the obligation of Terminix to pay Rentokil Initial by way of compensation a termination payment of
$50 million upon the termination of the merger agreement as a result of Terminix’s failure to obtain the
requisite Terminix stockholder approval for the merger proposal; and
risks and other considerations of the type and nature described under the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” beginning on pages 37 and 63, respectively.
The Terminix board of directors considered the factors described above as a whole, including through
engaging in discussions with Terminix senior management and Terminix’s outside legal and financial
advisors. Based on this review and consideration, the Terminix board of directors unanimously concluded
that these factors, on balance, supported a determination that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the transaction, were advisable and in the best interests of
Terminix stockholders, and to make its recommendation to Terminix stockholders that they vote to adopt the
merger agreement.
In addition, the Terminix board of directors was aware of and considered the fact that Terminix’s directors
and executive officers may have certain interests in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of Terminix stockholders generally, including the treatment of equity awards held by such
directors and executive officers in the transaction, as described in the section of this proxy statement/​
prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Transaction” beginning on page 105.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the Terminix board of directors considered is
not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The Terminix board of directors collectively reached the
conclusion to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the transaction, in light of the various factors described above and other
86 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
factors that the members of the Terminix board of directors believed appropriate. In view of the complexity
and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the Terminix board of directors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the transaction, the Terminix board of directors did not find it useful to, and
did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights or values to any of the
factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to
whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the
ultimate determination of the Terminix board of directors. In considering the factors discussed above,
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Terminix board of directors in
approving the merger agreement is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the
factors discussed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 63.",96,101
TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Rentokil Initial’s Reasons for the Transaction,"Rentokil Initial’s Reasons for the Transaction
The Rentokil Initial board of directors carefully evaluated the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and unanimously approved the terms of, and the transactions contemplated by, the
merger agreement and unanimously resolved that the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby (including the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals) be submitted for approval
by the Rentokil Initial shareholders.
In the course of reaching its decision, the Rentokil Initial board of directors consulted with Rentokil Initial’s
management and its financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following
factors that weighed in favor of the transaction (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
Increased scale and leadership in the global pest control market. The combined company will
become the leading global pest control company, with a customer base of approximately 4.9 million
customers and approximately 56,000 colleagues globally. The transaction will deliver a significantly
enhanced network and improved route density, bringing the combined company closer to its
customers, with its colleagues able to spend more time directly with customers and less time driving
to and from customer visits.
Substantially increased scale in North America, providing an enlarged platform for profitable
growth. The combined company will become the leading player in North America, the world’s largest
pest control market (representing approximately 51% of the global market and estimated to be worth
approximately US$11 billion). As such, North America is of significant strategic importance and focus
for Rentokil Initial. It is a highly competitive and fragmented market comprising over 20,000 pest
control companies. Commercial pest control comprises the largest segment in North America at
approximately 45% of the market, with residential comprising approximately 35% and termites at
approximately 20%. Rentokil Initial is currently a leading brand in commercial pest control, while
Terminix is the most recognized brand for termite and residential pest control in the United States,
undertaking approximately 50,000 customer visits each day from 380 locations across 45 states.
Terminix generated pest control revenues of approximately US$2 billion for the year ended December
31, 2021. The combined company will become the leading global pest control company, which will
include a leading brand for residential and termite pest control in North America, as well as the
leading global brand in commercial pest control. Upon the completion of the transaction,
approximately 60% of the combined company’s total revenues is expected to come from North
America. The combined company will create additional scale, which will enable further investments in
people, service quality, innovation, digital technology and applications and sustainability, to meet the
future needs of customers and colleagues. Following the completion of the transaction, the combined
company intends to open a new science and innovation center in the United States focused on
termite and residential pest control.
A complementary and synergistic combination. Rentokil Initial and Terminix have complementary
service lines (combining Rentokil Initial’s expertise in commercial pest control globally with Terminix’s
expertise in residential and termite pest control in North America). Rentokil Initial and Terminix’s
geographic footprints in North America are also complementary, allowing greater route density to be
87 •

• 
• 
• 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
achieved, and presenting further opportunities to enhance operational efficiency. Both Rentokil Initial
and Terminix have similar operating models which will enable the effective sharing of best practices in
the future. In addition, Rentokil Initial is a leader in innovation and digital technology, creating
services and products which can be rolled out to Terminix’s approximately 2.9 million pest control
customers. The combined company is expected to generate material annual pre-tax cost synergies of
at least US$150 million (£113 million, assuming the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate as of December
10, 2021) by the third full year following the completion of the transaction, owing to greater footprint
density, procurement leverage, property rationalization, duplicate administrative and overhead
rationalization, marketing, sales effectiveness, head office synergies and financing. Both Rentokil
Initial and Terminix have a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and are committed to
creating a high-quality working environment with attractive opportunities for colleagues from both
businesses to develop rewarding long-term careers in the combined company. It is expected that the
combined company will be able to further differentiate itself from its competitors through its strong
focus on people, customers and delivering products and services responsibly, and benefiting society
and the environment by acting in a responsible manner.
An attractive financial profile.
The combined company will have an attractive financial profile, with the opportunity to increase
the combined company’s net operating margins through cost reductions and operational
efficiencies by approximately one percent in each of the three full calendar years following the
completion of the transaction. A strong balance sheet will support growth through continued
investments in people, innovation, digital technologies and sustainability, and through further
M&A opportunities around the world.
The transaction will create a larger, highly diversified and more resilient business in the markets
of pest control and hygiene and wellbeing. In the North America pest control market, the
combined company’s business will be well balanced between residential and termite (expected to
be approximately 60% of revenues) and commercial (expected to be approximately 40% of
revenues) pest services. As of the end of Terminix’s fiscal year 2021, revenue from termite control
is approximately 45% of Terminix’s residential revenues, and will become approximately 20% of
the combined company’s North America pest business upon the completion of the transaction.
The combined company will also have a strong, complementary international hygiene and
wellbeing business, with leading positions in 22 of its 65 markets. Revenues from Hygiene &
Wellbeing are expected to form approximately 21% of total combined company revenues and the
segment is expected to deliver 4% to 6% organic growth each year over the medium term from
2022.
The Rentokil Initial board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially
negative factors concerning the merger agreement and the transaction in connection with its deliberations,
including:
The difficulties and challenges inherent in completing the proposed transaction and integrating the
businesses, operations and workforce of Terminix with those of Rentokil Initial and the potential risk
that some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction may fail to materialize, or may not occur
within the time periods anticipated;
The potential risk of diverting management and colleague attention and resources from the operation
of Rentokil Initial’s business and towards the completion of the transaction;
The risk that certain key employees of Terminix may not choose to remain with the combined company
following the closing;
That Rentokil Initial would be required to pay to Terminix a termination fee of $150 million in the event
the merger agreement were to be terminated in certain circumstances if the Rentokil Initial board of
directors were to change its recommendation;
The ability of the Terminix board of directors, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the merger
agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal;

Terminix has retained Lazard to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transaction. In connection
with this engagement, Terminix requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Terminix common stock (other than holders of certain excluded shares as described in the merger
agreement) of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders in the transaction.
On December 13, 2021, at a meeting of the Terminix board of directors held to evaluate the transaction, Lazard
rendered to the Terminix board of directors an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated December 13, 2021, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken described in such opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of Terminix common
stock (other than holders of certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) in the transaction
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated December 13, 2021, which describes the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is
attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this document. The summary of the written opinion of
Lazard, dated December 13, 2021, set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of Lazard’s opinion attached as Annex B. Lazard’s opinion was for the benefit of the Terminix board of
directors (in its capacity as such) and Lazard’s opinion was rendered to the Terminix board of directors in connection
with its evaluation of the transaction and did not address any terms or other aspects (other than the merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s opinion) of the transaction. Lazard’s opinion did not address
the relative merits of the transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which Terminix
might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Terminix to engage in the transaction. Lazard’s opinion is
not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any Terminix stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote or act with respect to the transaction or any matter relating thereto.
In connection with its opinion, Lazard:

of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Terminix or Rentokil Initial or concerning the
solvency or fair value of Terminix or Rentokil Initial, and Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or
appraisal. Lazard was not provided with, and did not have access to, financial forecasts relating to Rentokil
Initial prepared by the management of Rentokil Initial. Accordingly, Lazard was advised by Terminix and
assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections
are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of Rentokil Initial and, at the
direction of Terminix, Lazard relied on the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections for
purposes of Lazard’s financial analyses in connection with its opinion. With respect to the financial
forecasts utilized in Lazard’s analyses, including those related to projected synergies and other benefits
anticipated by the management of Terminix to be realized from the transaction, Lazard assumed, with the
consent of Terminix, that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of Terminix and Rentokil Initial, respectively,
and to such synergies and other benefits. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to
any such forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based, including with respect to the potential
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on such forecasts or assumptions.
Further, Lazard’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. Lazard assumed no
responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date
of its opinion. Lazard further noted that volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets
90 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
relating to, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic, may or may not have an effect on Terminix and Rentokil
Initial and Lazard did not express any opinion as to the effects of such volatility or such disruption on
Terminix or Rentokil Initial. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Terminix
common stock, Rentokil Initial ADSs or Rentokil Initial ordinary shares may trade at any time subsequent to
the announcement of the transaction. In connection with Lazard’s engagement, Lazard was authorized to
solicit indications of interest regarding a potential transaction with Terminix from a limited number of third
parties. In addition, Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction as compared to
any other transaction or business strategy in which Terminix might engage or the merits of the underlying
decision by Terminix to engage in the transaction.
In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that the transaction will be
consummated on the terms described in the merger agreement, without any waiver or modification of any
material terms or conditions. Representatives of Terminix advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the
merger agreement, when executed, would conform to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects.
Lazard also assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or
third-party approvals and consents for the transaction will not have an adverse effect on Terminix, Rentokil
Initial or the transaction. Lazard further assumed, with the consent of Terminix, that the transaction will
qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the
transaction, nor did Lazard’s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which
Lazard understood that Terminix obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.
Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the merger consideration to
the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s opinion) of the transaction, including, without limitation, the form
or structure of the transaction or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or
contemplated by, the transaction. In addition, Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the
amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or
otherwise.
Summary of the Financial Analyses of Terminix’s Financial Advisor
In preparing its opinion to the Terminix board of directors, Lazard performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the
financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying Lazard’s opinion, nor does the order
of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial
analyses. The preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or analysis is not readily
susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of all of the
analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with
regard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Lazard made its determination
as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of
the analyses. Accordingly, Lazard believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be
considered as a whole and in context. Lazard further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and
factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors
or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
processes underlying its analyses and opinion.
In performing its analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the
control of Terminix and Rentokil Initial. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly
comparable to Terminix, Rentokil Initial or their respective businesses or the transaction. Accordingly, an
evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions
reviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions. Accordingly,
such analyses may not necessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could
91 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
be deemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of Terminix and Rentokil Initial in or underlying
Lazard’s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those estimates or those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the
value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company
may actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.
Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any
particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken
as the views of Lazard regarding the actual values of Rentokil Initial or Terminix. Except as otherwise noted,
the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data
as it existed on or before December 13, 2021, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Lazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in
the transaction. The type and amount of merger consideration payable in the transaction was determined
through negotiations between Terminix and Rentokil Initial, rather than by any financial advisor, and was
approved by the Terminix board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that
of the Terminix board of directors and the Rentokil Initial board of directors. Lazard’s opinion and analyses
were only one of many factors considered by the Terminix board of directors in its evaluation of the
transaction and the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the
Terminix board of directors or management with respect to the transaction or the merger consideration
payable in the transaction.
Financial Analyses
The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “- Financial Analyses” is a summary of the
material financial analyses provided by Lazard in connection with its opinion, dated December 13, 2021, to the
Terminix board of directors. The summary set forth below is not a comprehensive description of all analyses
undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the analyses in the summary below indicate
that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard’s financial analyses, the tables must be
read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Future results may differ from
those described and such differences may be material.
For purposes of the financial analyses described below in this section, the term “implied per share merger
consideration” means approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock, consisting of (i) the cash
consideration of the per share cash amount per share of Terminix common stock and (ii) an implied value of
the stock consideration of approximately $44.00 per share, which is calculated based on (x) an exchange ratio
of 5.3094 shares of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (in the form of 1.0619 Rentokil Initial ADS based on 5:1
ratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares for each Rentokil Initial ADS) for one share of Terminix common
stock, (y) the average of the volume weighted average trading prices of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on
each of the five consecutive trading days ending on December 10, 2021 of £6.27 and (z) an exchange rate of 1
GBP to 1.3225 USD based on the average GBP to USD exchange rates on each of the five consecutive trading
days ending on December 10, 2021.
The financial data utilized for Terminix in the financial analyses described below were based on financial
forecasts and other data prepared by Terminix’s management relating to the business of Terminix. Lazard was
not provided with, and did not have access to, financial forecasts relating to Rentokil Initial prepared by the
management of Rentokil Initial. The financial data utilized for Rentokil Initial in the financial analyses
described below were based on the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Terminix Financial Analyses
Comparable Public Companies Analysis
Using public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information
of Terminix to corresponding financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on
Lazard’s professional judgment and experience, Lazard considered generally relevant for purposes of
analysis. Due to the limited number of comparable publicly traded companies in the pest control industry, for
purposes of its analysis, Lazard included companies in the broader residential and commercial services
industry. The selected companies used in this analysis were as follows:
Pest Control (collectively, the “Pest Control Peers”)
Rollins, Inc.
Rentokil Initial
Residential Services (collectively, the “Residential Peers”)
FirstService Corporation
Frontdoor, Inc.
HomeServe plc
Leslie’s, Inc.
Commercial Services (collectively, the “Commercial Peers”)
ABM Industries Incorporated
Aramark
BrightView Holdings, Inc.
Cintas Corporation
Ecolab Inc.
GDI Integrated Facility Services Inc.
Lazard selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate
businesses similar in certain respects to the business of Terminix. Terminix is a leading provider of pest and
termite management services across residential and commercial markets. Pest Control Peers include large pest
and termite control companies providing comparable services to Terminix across both residential and
commercial end-markets. Given the limited number of public companies singularly focused on pest control,
Lazard expanded the Terminix peer set to include residential and commercial service providers focused on
services other than pest control. Residential Peers include companies that provide services primarily to
residential end-markets, such as appliance repair and maintenance, pool care and property services.
Commercial Peers include companies that provide services primarily to commercial end-markets, such as food
services, uniform services, commercial landscaping and other facility maintenance. However, none of the
selected companies is identical to Terminix and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are
materially different from those of Terminix. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard
believes that purely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the merger
consideration and that qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and
operating characteristics and prospects of Terminix and the selected companies that could affect the public
trading values of each company are also relevant.
As set forth in the table below, for each selected company, Lazard calculated its enterprise value (defined as
equity market value, plus debt, lease liabilities, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash
equivalents) as a multiple of its EBITDA (defined as estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, and adjusted for lease expenses (excluding short-term and variable expenses) for
companies reporting in U.S. GAAP) for calendar year 2022 (“EV / 2022 EBITDA”). The EV /
93 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2022 EBITDA multiple observed for the Pest Control Peer (other than Rentokil Initial) was 24.8x. The median
EV / 2022 EBITDA multiple observed for the Residential Peers and the Commercial Peers was 12.3x and 10.8x,
respectively.

Market data as of 12/8/2021. Enterprise value includes operating lease liabilities and EBITDA includes
operating lease expense (excluding short-term and variable expenses); adjustment is made for comparability
with Rentokil Initial financials.
Using its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of multiples of estimated EV / 2022
EBITDA, derived from the EV / 2022 EBITDA multiples of the selected companies, of 12.0x to 16.0x, to
Terminix’s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value
per share of Terminix common stock of $36.80 to $51.20 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the
implied per share merger consideration of $55.00.
Precedent Transactions Analysis
Lazard reviewed and analyzed, to the extent publicly available, financial information for selected precedent
transactions involving companies (i) in the pest control industry and (ii) in the consumer / commercial
services industry that Lazard believed, based on its experience and professional judgment, to be generally
relevant for purposes of this analysis. Terminix is a leading provider of pest and termite management
services, thus Lazard’s precedent transaction analysis included transactions with targets largely focused on
pest control. Given the limited number of transactions singularly focused on pest control, Lazard expanded
its analysis to include relevant transactions in consumer and commercial services. Lazard included consumer
and commercial services transactions on the basis of Terminix’s participation in similar services end-markets.
These transactions included targets performing services including tree care, landscaping, restoration,
cleaning, uniform and facility services.
Although none of the selected precedent transactions or the companies party to such transactions is
directly comparable to the transaction or to Terminix, the selected precedent transactions were chosen
because certain aspects of the precedent transactions, for purposes of this analysis and based on the
professional judgment and experience of Lazard, may be considered similar to the transaction. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and

For each of the selected precedent transactions, Lazard reviewed the enterprise value of the target company
implied by the selected transaction as a multiple of the target company’s EBITDA for the 12 months
preceding the announcement date (“EV / LTM EBITDA”). The mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple observed for
the selected pest control transactions was 18.3x. The mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple observed for the
selected consumer / commercial services transactions was 17.4x. Lazard applied a range of EV / LTM EBITDA
multiples of 18.0x to 20.0x derived from the selected precedent transactions to Terminix’s EBITDA for the 12
months ending September 30, 2021. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of
Terminix common stock of $52.60 to $59.15 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per
share merger consideration of $55.00.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Terminix by calculating, based on the forecasts
provided by Terminix’s management, the estimated present value (as of September 30, 2021) of the stand-
alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Terminix was forecasted to generate during the fourth quarter
of calendar year 2021 and during calendar years 2022 through 2025. Lazard also calculated a range of implied
terminal values for Terminix by applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 2.5% to the
stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flow attributable to Terminix for calendar year 2025, which range of
perpetuity growth rates was selected based on Lazard’s professional judgment and experience, taking into
account, among other things, the forecasts provided by Terminix’s management and trends in the overall
economy generally and in the industries and sectors in which Terminix operates. The cash flows and range of
implied terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of September 30, 2021) using a selected
range of discount rates of 7.8% to 8.8% derived based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation.
This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Terminix common stock of $42.90 to
$56.35 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share merger consideration of $55.00.

leading provider of pest and termite management services across residential and commercial markets. The
Pest Control Peers include large pest and termite control companies providing comparable services to

Note: Terminix shown on a consensus basis. Market data as of 12/8/2021. Enterprise value includes operating
lease liabilities and EBITDA includes operating lease expense (excluding short-term and variable expenses);
adjustment is made for comparability with Rentokil Initial financials.
This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares of £5.15
to £6.70, as compared to the closing price of £6.26 per Rentokil Initial ordinary share on December 8, 2021.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Rentokil Initial by calculating, based on the Terminix
management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections, the estimated present value (as of June 30, 2021) of the
stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Rentokil Initial was forecasted to generate during the
third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2021 and during calendar years 2022 through 2025. Lazard also
calculated a range of implied terminal values for Rentokil Initial by applying a selected range of perpetuity
growth rates of 2.0% to 2.5% to the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flow attributable to Rentokil
Initial for calendar year 2025, which range of perpetuity growth rates was selected based on Lazard’s
professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, the Terminix management
unaudited Rentokil Initial projections and trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and
sectors in which Rentokil Initial operates. The cash flows and range of implied terminal values were then
discounted to present value (as of September 30, 2021) using a selected range of discount rates of 5.3% to
6.3% derived based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation.
This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares of £4.85
to £7.70 (rounded to the nearest £0.05), as compared to the closing price of £6.26 per Rentokil Initial ordinary
share on December 8, 2021.
Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis
Lazard used the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for Terminix common stock and
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares indicated in the selected public companies analysis and the discounted cash
flow analyses described above and calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios of Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares to Terminix common stock.
97 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The implied reference range of exchange ratios was determined by (i) using as the low end, the amount
calculated by dividing the low end of the implied per share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus
the per share cash amount), by the high end of the implied per share equity value reference range for
Rentokil Initial and (ii) using as the high end, the amount calculated by dividing the high end of the implied
per share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus the per share cash amount) by the low end of the
implied per share equity value reference range for Rentokil Initial. This analysis resulted in the following

Lazard observed certain additional information that was not considered part of its financial analyses for its
opinion but was noted for informational reference for the Terminix board of directors, including the following:
Certain Terminix Financial Analyses
Lazard applied the calculations described above under “- Financial Analyses - Terminix Financial
Analyses - Comparable Public Companies Analysis” utilizing the Wall Street equity analysts’ consensus
estimates for Terminix in lieu of the forecasts provided by Terminix’s management. This analysis resulted in a
range of implied equity value per share of Terminix common stock of $35.85 to $50.00 (rounded to the nearest
$0.05), as compared to the implied per share merger consideration of $55.00.
Lazard applied the calculations described above under “- Financial Analyses - Terminix Financial
Analyses - Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” utilizing the Wall Street equity analysts’ consensus estimates
for Terminix in lieu of the forecasts provided by Terminix’s management. This analysis resulted in a range of
implied equity value per share of Terminix common stock of $32.95 to $43.55 (rounded to the nearest $0.05),
as compared to the implied per share merger consideration of $55.00.
Present Value of Future Share Price
Lazard performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future share price of Terminix
common stock. Lazard first calculated the theoretical per share equity value of Terminix common stock as of
December 31, 2023 by applying a range of next 12 months (“NTM”) multiples of 12.7x to 14.7x to Terminix’s
estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2024 (based on the forecasts provided by Terminix’s management).
Lazard then calculated the resulting range of implied per share equity values as of December 31, 2023 and
discounted that range to present value using a discount rate of 9.4%, which reflects an estimate of Terminix’s
cost of equity. This analysis resulted in an implied equity value per share range for Terminix common stock of
$46.40 to $53.95 (rounded to the nearest $0.05).
Lazard conducted an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future share price of Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares. Lazard first calculated the theoretical per share equity value of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares as of December 31, 2023 by applying a range of next NTM multiples of 16.9x to 18.9x to
estimated Rentokil Initial EBITDA for calendar year 2024 (based on the Terminix management unaudited
Rentokil Initial projections). Lazard then calculated the resulting range of implied per share equity values as
of December 31, 2023 and discounted that range to present value using a discount rate of 7.0%, which
reflects an estimate of Rentokil Initial’s cost of equity. Lazard also calculated the estimated annual dividend
payments before December 31, 2023 and discounted them to present value using a discount rate of 7.0% and
included such present values in the implied equity value per share. This analysis resulted in an implied
equity value per share range for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares of £6.50 to £7.25 (rounded to the nearest
£0.05).
Lazard then calculated an implied exchange ratio reference range by dividing the low end of the implied per
share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus the per share cash amount), by the high end of the
implied per share equity value reference range for Rentokil Initial, in each case as determined by the present
value of future share price analysis described above, and by dividing the high end of the implied
98 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
per share equity value reference range for Terminix (minus the per share cash amount), by the low end of the
implied per share equity value reference range for Rentokil Initial, in each case as determined by the present
value of future share price analysis described above. This analysis resulted in a range of implied exchange
ratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to Terminix common stock of 3.689x to 5.006x.
Lazard also applied the calculations described in this section utilizing the Wall Street equity analysts’
consensus estimates for Terminix in lieu of the forecasts provided by Terminix’s management. This analysis
resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Terminix common stock of $37.60 to $44.20 (rounded
to the nearest $0.05) and a range of implied exchange ratio of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to Terminix
common stock of 2.769x to 3.871x.
Analyst Target Prices
Lazard observed price targets for Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares as reflected in
selected publicly available Wall Street equity research reports. Lazard observed that (x) the future price
targets for Terminix common stock ranged from $44.00 per share to $65.00 per share, which Lazard discounted
to present value based on an illustrative cost of equity of 9.4% to calculate a range of $41.10 per share to
$58.10 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.05), and (y) the price targets for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
ranged from £5.10 per share to £6.50 per share.
52-Week Trading Range
Lazard reviewed the range of historical trading prices of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares during the 52-week period ended December 8, 2021. Lazard observed that, during this period,
(x) the daily closing price of Terminix common stock ranged from $36.30 per share (rounded to the nearest
$0.05) (on December 1, 2021) to $55.00 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.05) (on January 13, 2021), and (y)
the daily closing price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares ranged from £4.60 per share (rounded to the nearest
£0.05) (on March 4, 2021) to £6.40 per share (on November 12, 2021).
General
In connection with Lazard’s services as a financial advisor to the Terminix board of directors, Terminix agreed
to pay Lazard an aggregate fee of $45 million, $5.0 million of which has been paid and the remainder of which
is payable contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, Terminix has agreed to reimburse
certain of Lazard’s expenses arising, and to indemnify Lazard against certain liabilities that may arise, out of
Lazard’s engagement.
Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for
estate, corporate and other purposes. In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion, Lazard has
provided certain investment banking services to Terminix, for which Lazard received compensation, including
having advised Terminix in the sale of ServiceMaster Brands (for which Lazard received aggregate fees of
approximately $20 million). In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion, Lazard has not been
engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Rentokil Initial and Lazard has not received any
compensation from Rentokil Initial during this period. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and its
affiliates and employees may trade securities of Terminix, Rentokil Initial and certain of their respective
affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of Terminix,
Rentokil Initial and certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard’s opinion was approved by
the opinion committee of Lazard.
Lazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory
and other services. Lazard was selected to act as investment banker to Terminix because of its qualifications,
expertise and reputation in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions generally and in particular, as
an advisor to companies in Terminix’s sector, as well as its familiarity with the business of Terminix.

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Certain Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,"Certain Terminix Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
While Terminix has from time to time provided a financial outlook to investors with respect to the then-
current fiscal year, Terminix has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed longer-term internal
projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,
unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, as described under
the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Background of the
Transaction,” beginning on page 77, in the ordinary course of business Terminix management prepares a
strategy plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Terminix board of directors, that reflects
Terminix management’s financial and business outlook for Terminix over a five-year period. As part of
Terminix’s annual business review, Terminix management prepared and provided to the Terminix board of
directors certain nonpublic, internal financial projections included in the Terminix strategy plan regarding
Terminix’s future operations for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, and these projections were reviewed by the
Terminix board of directors on September 1, 2021 (as defined earlier, the “September 2021 Terminix
management unaudited Terminix projections”). On October 7, 2021, Terminix management provided a copy of
the September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections to Lazard, and a copy was
subsequently made available to Rentokil Initial and its financial advisors, Barclays and Goldman Sachs
International.
Later that month, in conjunction with the normal review of Terminix’s financial performance against
Terminix’s long-term incentive targets, Terminix management prepared certain updates to the September 2021
Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections to reflect, among other factors, Terminix’s actual
financial results for the period from July 1, 2021 through August 31, 2021 (as defined earlier, the “October
2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections”). These results, and the associated estimated
effect on future periods, were negatively impacted by lower staffing levels caused by the insourcing of
certain national accounts customers as well as an increase in worker mobility during a robust labor market.
On October 19, 2021, the October 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections were provided to
Lazard and subsequently reviewed by the Terminix board of directors at its meeting on October 21, 2021.
Thereafter, in December, Terminix management engaged in its regular year-end review of projected near-term
financial performance for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, which resulted in certain refinements to the October
2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections for those fiscal years to reflect, among other
factors, Terminix’s actual financial results for the period from September 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021.
These updated projections were provided to Lazard on December 7, 2021 (and a copy was subsequently
made available to Rentokil Initial and Rentokil Initial’s financial advisors, Barclays and Goldman Sachs
International) and were reviewed by the Terminix board of directors on December 10, 2021 (as defined earlier,
the “December 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections”).
Terminix directed Lazard to use and rely upon, for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion, the
December 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 and the
October 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections for fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Based
on guidance from, and at the direction of, Terminix management, in preparing its analysis and fairness
opinion, Lazard added $25 million in operating leases to adjusted EBITDA for each fiscal year over the five-
year period to facilitate comparison against Rentokil Initial’s corresponding financial information presented
in accordance with IFRS (the “Lazard fairness opinion Terminix management unaudited Terminix
projections”).
We refer to the September 2021 Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections, the October 2021
Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections, the December 2021 Terminix management unaudited
Terminix projections and the Lazard fairness opinion Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections
collectively as the “Terminix management unaudited Terminix projections.”
100 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
In connection with the transaction, Terminix management also reviewed certain unaudited prospective
financial information concerning Rentokil Initial on a stand-alone basis contained in publicly available Wall
Street research analyst financial forecasts and consensus estimates (and extrapolations therefrom) for the
fiscal years ending December 31, 2021 through December 31, 2025. We refer to these unaudited projections
as the “Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections,” and to the Terminix management
unaudited Terminix projections and the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections,
collectively, as the “Terminix management unaudited projections.” The Terminix management unaudited
Rentokil Initial projections were provided to the Terminix board of directors in connection with its
consideration of the proposed transaction as well as to Lazard, which was directed by Terminix management
to use and rely upon the Terminix management unaudited Rentokil Initial projections for purposes of its
financial analysis and fairness opinion.
The Terminix management unaudited projections were prepared treating Terminix and Rentokil Initial,
respectively, on a stand-alone basis, without giving effect to the proposed transaction, including any impact
of the negotiation or execution of the proposed transaction, the expenses that may be incurred in connection
with the proposed transaction or the consummation thereof, the potential synergies that may be achieved by
the combined company as a result of the proposed transaction, the effect of any business or strategic
decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or
in anticipation of the proposed transaction, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions
which would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead
altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the transaction. In connection with the
proposed transaction, Terminix management prepared pro-forma analyses which were presented to the
Terminix board of directors and assumed $175 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies, with 25% of the
amount to be achieved during 2022, 75% of the amount to be achieved during 2023, and the full amount to be
achieved during 2024 and subsequent years. Terminix management assumed that the aggregate cost of
achieving the projected cost synergies would be $175 million, with 25% of the amount to be incurred during
2022, 50% of the amount to be incurred during 2023, and 25% of the amount to be incurred during 2024.
These assumed cost synergies including cost to achieve such cost synergies, as defined earlier and which
we refer to collectively as the “Terminix management assumed cost synergies,” are not reflected in the
Terminix management unaudited projections. The Terminix management assumed cost synergies were
provided to Lazard, which was directed by Terminix management to use and rely upon the Terminix
management assumed cost synergies for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion.
The Terminix management unaudited projections are being included in this proxy statement/​prospectus to
give stockholders access to certain non-public information provided to the Terminix board of directors and
Terminix’s financial advisor and to Rentokil Initial and its financial advisors. The inclusion of the financial
projections by Terminix should not be regarded as an indication that the Terminix board of directors,
Terminix, the Rentokil Initial board of directors, Rentokil Initial, Lazard, Barclays or Goldman Sachs
International or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them to be an
assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should
not be relied on as such.
In addition, the Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost
synergies were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the
published guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, IFRS or GAAP, but, in the view of Terminix’s
management were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the
time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of management’s knowledge and
belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Terminix or Rentokil
Initial, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being
necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/​prospectus are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management
assumed cost synergies. Although Terminix’s management believes there is a reasonable basis for the
Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies, Terminix
cautions stockholders that future results could be materially different from the Terminix management
unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies. This summary of the Terminix
management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost
101 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
synergies is included in this proxy statement/prospectus because the Terminix management unaudited
projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies were provided to Terminix’s financial
advisor and to the Terminix board of directors for purposes of considering and evaluating the transaction
and the merger agreement.
The Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies are
subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While
presented with numerical specificity, the Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix
management assumed cost synergies are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Terminix’s management as of the date of their
preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons,
including general economic conditions, trends in the pest control industry, the regulatory environment,
competition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus under the sections entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” beginning on pages
63 and 37, respectively. See also “Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page 328 of
this proxy statement/prospectus. The Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix
management assumed cost synergies also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change. Because the Terminix management unaudited projections were developed for Terminix on
a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the transaction, they do not reflect any synergies that may be
realized as a result of the transaction or any changes to Terminix’s or Rentokil Initial’s operations or strategy
that may be implemented after completion of the transaction. There can be no assurance that the Terminix
management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies will be realized, and
actual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the
Terminix management unaudited projections and the Terminix management assumed cost synergies relate, the
less predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.
The Terminix management unaudited projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Terminix
believes are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. Terminix management
regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP or IFRS for forecasting,
budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP or IFRS measures. While Terminix believes
that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand the
operating results and to analyze Terminix’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there
are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, are not reported by all of Terminix’s or Rentokil
Initial’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Terminix’s or Rentokil
Initial’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.
None of Terminix, Rentokil Initial, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers,
directors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the
Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies, and none
of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Terminix management
unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies to reflect circumstances existing
after the date the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost
synergies were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions underlying the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management
assumed cost synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities
laws, Terminix does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Terminix
management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost synergies, even in the event
that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Terminix, Rentokil Initial or their affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Terminix
stockholder or other person regarding Terminix’s ultimate performance compared to the information
contained in the Terminix management unaudited projections or the Terminix management assumed cost
synergies or that forecasted results will be achieved. Terminix has made no representation to Rentokil Initial,
in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Terminix management unaudited projections or the
Terminix management assumed cost synergies.

In considering the recommendation of the Terminix board of directors to vote in favor of the merger proposal,
Terminix stockholders should be aware that Terminix’s directors and executive officers have interests in the
transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Terminix stockholders generally. The
Terminix board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the merger, and in recommending to Terminix
stockholders that the merger agreement be approved. Such interests are described below. The transaction
will be a “change in control” for purposes of certain Terminix executive compensation and benefit plans and
agreements described below.

Treatment of Outstanding Terminix Equity Awards
Terminix Stock Options
At the first effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Terminix common stock (each, a
“Terminix Stock Option”) that is then vested and exercisable will be cancelled in consideration for the right to
receive, within 10 business days following the first effective time, an amount (the “Vested Option
Consideration”) in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess of (1) the Vested Award Consideration, over (2)
the exercise price per share of Terminix common stock subject to such Terminix Stock Option and (y) the
number of shares of Terminix common stock subject to such Terminix Stock Option immediately prior to the
first effective time, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of this proxy
statement/prospectus, “Vested Award Consideration” means the sum of (A) the per share cash amount and
(B) the product of the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial ADS price.
All other Terminix Stock Options outstanding at the first effective time will at that time be assumed by
Rentokil Initial and converted into a stock option award (each an “Assumed Option”) to purchase a number
of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the number of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix
Stock Option multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
Rentokil Initial ADSs. The exercise price per Rentokil Initial ADS applicable to each Assumed Option will be
equal to the exercise price per share of Terminix common stock applicable to such Terminix Stock Option
divided by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Assumed Option
will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Terminix Stock Option, including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a qualifying
termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the merger. For purposes of this
proxy statement/prospectus, “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means the sum, rounded to four decimal places,
equal to (i) the exchange ratio, plus (ii) the quotient of (A) the per share cash amount and (B) the Rentokil
Initial ADS price.
Terminix Restricted Stock Unit Awards
At the first effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Terminix
common stock that vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a “Terminix RSU Award”) that is vested
as of the first effective time will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, within 10 business
days following the first effective time, the Vested Award Consideration, without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes.
Each unvested Terminix RSU Award will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and will be converted into a restricted
stock unit award (each an “Assumed RSU Award”) that settles in a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to
(x) the number of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix RSU Award multiplied by (y) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed RSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix RSU Award, including any terms and
conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a qualifying termination of the holder’s employment in
connection with or following the merger.
Terminix Performance Stock Unit Awards
At the first effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Terminix
common stock that vests based on the achievement of a combination of time- and performance-based
vesting conditions (each, a “Terminix PSU Award”) granted prior to the date of the merger agreement (“Pre-
Signing PSU Awards”) will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and converted into a performance stock unit award
(each an “Assumed PSU Award”). These Assumed PSU Awards will settle, subject to the achievement of the
applicable time-based vesting conditions, in a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix PSU Award (determined by deeming the
applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of the target level and
106 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the actual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior to the first effective time), multiplied
by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Each such
Assumed PSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied
to the corresponding Terminix PSU Award, other than any performance-based vested conditions, including
any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a qualifying termination of employment in
connection with or within 24 months following the merger.
Each Terminix PSU Award granted after the date of the merger agreement (under circumstances permitted by
the merger agreement) (“Post-Signing PSU Awards”) will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and converted into
an Assumed PSU Award that settles, subject to the achievement of the applicable time and performance-
based vesting conditions, in a target number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the product of (1) the number
of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix PSU Award (determined by assuming the
applicable performance goals to be achieved at target level) multiplied by (2) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Each such Assumed PSU Award will continue to
have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix PSU
Award, including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a qualifying termination of
employment in connection with or within 24 months following the merger, except that the applicable
performance metrics will be adjusted in good faith by Terminix and Rentokil Initial to provide for performance
metrics that are based on the combined businesses.
For purposes of the Terminix Equity Awards, the term “qualifying termination of employment” means, after a
change in control of Terminix (which the merger will constitute), an employee’s employment is terminated by
Terminix without ”cause” or by the employee due to a constructive termination (otherwise referred to as
“good reason”). Each such term is defined as follows: “cause” means (a) the participant’s willful and
continued failure to perform substantially the participant’s duties with Terminix or any of its subsidiaries
(other than any such failure resulting from the participant’s incapacity as a result of physical or mental
illness) after a written demand for substantial performance specifying the manner in which the participant
has not performed such duties is delivered to the participant by the person or entity that supervises or
manages the participant; (b) the participant’s engaging in willful and serious misconduct that is injurious to
Terminix or any of its subsidiaries; (c) the participant’s commission of one or more acts of fraud or personal
dishonesty resulting in or intended to result in personal enrichment at the expense of Terminix or any of its
subsidiaries; (d) the participant’s substantial abusive use of alcohol, drugs or similar substances that, in the
sole judgment of Terminix, impairs the participant’s job performance; (e) the participant’s material violation of
any Terminix policy that results in harm to Terminix or any of its subsidiaries; or (f) the participant’s
indictment for or conviction of (or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to) a felony or of any crime (whether or
not a felony) involving moral turpitude; and “good reason” means: (i) a material reduction in the teammate’s
position(s), authority or responsibilities that the teammate had immediately prior to the closing; (ii) a material
reduction in the teammate’s aggregate (a) target Terminix Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) bonus opportunity
and (b) annual target long-term equity incentive opportunity, as in effect immediately prior to the closing (for
the avoidance of doubt, a reduction by more than ten percent (10%) of the teammate’s aggregate target AIP
bonus opportunity and annual target long-term equity incentive opportunity, as in effect immediately prior to
the closing, shall constitute a material reduction for purposes of this paragraph); (iii) a material reduction in
the teammate’s annual base salary as of immediately prior to the closing; or (iv) material change in the
location of teammate’s primary worksite, which will be at least more than 50 miles from teammate’s primary
Terminix worksite (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any non-permanent remote or non-permanent
virtual work location currently used as the teammate’s primary worksite due to the COVID-19 pandemic)
immediately prior to the closing.
See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Terminix Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 110 for an estimate
of the value of each of Terminix’s named executive officer’s unvested Terminix equity awards.
Terminix Director Deferred Share Equivalents
At the first effective time, each outstanding director deferred share equivalent award with respect to shares
of Terminix common stock (each, a “Terminix DSE Award”) will be cancelled in consideration for
107 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the right to receive, within 10 business days following the first effective time, in respect of each share of
Terminix common stock subject to such Terminix DSE Award, the Vested Award Consideration, without
interest.
Quantification of Payments
For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Terminix’s executive officers on settlement
of their unvested Terminix equity awards, see the section entitled “The Merger Proposal -​Interests of
Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction - Quantification of Potential Payments and
Benefits to Terminix Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 110
below.
The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to Terminix non-employee directors in settlement of
their currently outstanding Terminix DSE Awards is $1,693,153. This amount was determined using a price per
share of Terminix common stock of $43.83, which is the average closing price per share of Terminix common
stock as reported on the NYSE over the first five business days following the first public announcement of
the transaction on December 14, 2021.
Severance Benefits
Unless modified by separate agreement, and except as described below, upon a termination of employment
for any reason, Terminix has no obligation to pay any prospective amounts or provide any benefits to the
NEOs. Terminix’s obligations will consist of those obligations accrued at the date of termination, including
payment of earned salary, vacation and reimbursement of expenses.
Under the employment agreement entered into by and between Terminix and Mr. Ponton dated September 15,
2020, if Terminix terminates Mr. Ponton’s employment without “cause” or Mr. Ponton terminates his
employment for “good reason”  (each term as defined in the employment agreement) within 24 months after a
change in control of Terminix (which would include the merger), Mr. Ponton would receive: (1) a lump sum
payment equal to the sum of (x) two times the executive officer’s annual base salary and (y) two times the
executive officer’s annual target cash bonus under the AIP, and (2) a prorated bonus for the year in which his
termination occurs through his date of termination. Payments of Mr. Ponton’s severance benefits are subject
to Mr. Ponton signing a general release of claims. Mr. Ponton is also subject to covenants not to compete or
solicit customers or employees for two years following any termination of employment and an indefinite
covenant not to disclose confidential information.
The merger agreement with Rentokil Initial provides for enhanced severance practices and guidelines
pursuant to a change in control severance program adopted in connection with the merger covering all
employees of Terminix (the “Change in Control Severance Program”). Under this program, in the event of a
termination of any of Messrs. Riesbeck, Dart, Persson or Ms. Richardson’s employment without “cause” by
Terminix or for “good reason” by the officer (each term as generally defined above) within 12 months after
the closing of the merger, such individual would be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum payment equal to two
times the sum of the executive officer’s (x) annual base salary and (y) annual target cash bonus under the
AIP, each as in effect upon the qualifying termination of employment; (ii) to the extent such qualifying
termination occurs on or after July 1 of the given calendar year, a prorated AIP bonus in respect of the year
of termination; and (iii) monthly payment of the employer portion of medical continuation coverage (+2%),
less the then-active employee medical insurance premium rates for up to 18 months after the qualifying
termination of employment. Mr. Ponton is also entitled to such monthly reimbursements equal to the excess
of COBRA medical continuation coverage (+2%), less the then-active employee medical insurance premium
rates for up to 18 months after his qualifying termination of employment under the Change in Control
Severance Program. These payments are subject to the plan participant’s execution without revocation of a
general release of claims and observing covenants not to compete and not solicit customers or employees
for 24 months after termination of employment.
See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Terminix Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 110 for the
108 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
estimated amounts that each of Terminix’s named executive officers would receive under their severance
arrangements upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control of Terminix.
Bonus Compensation and Other Transaction-Based Payments
Annual Incentive Plan
The merger agreement provides for a lump sum payment, upon closing of the merger, in respect of each of
Terminix’s named executive officers’ annual incentive opportunity for the year in which the merger occurs
under the AIP. This payment will be in an amount equal to the greater of the AIP bonus that the officer would
receive upon the achievement of either target or actual performance metrics under the AIP for the year in
which closing occurs, prorated from January 1  to the date of the closing of the merger.
See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Terminix Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 110 for the estimated
amounts that each of Terminix’s named executive officers would receive under the AIP upon the closing of
the merger.
Retention Bonus Awards
In connection with the merger, Terminix and Rentokil Initial agreed that Terminix may provide up to $20
million of cash retention awards (the “Retention Pool”) to Terminix teammates. The retention awards are
designed to retain and incentivize the Terminix team as it executes the 2022 operating plan, achieves the
consummation of the merger and assists with the integration of the combined company after closing of the
transaction. Half of the Retention Pool has been allocated specifically to customer-facing, field operations
teammates, and the remainder has been allocated to key back-office teammates, including to the named
executive officers detailed below.
Under the merger agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Terminix board of directors is authorized to
grant retention awards from the Retention Pool, if any, to Terminix’s executive officers, in an amount not to
exceed $13 million in the aggregate. On February 17, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved retention
awards from the Retention Pool pursuant to retention agreements with each of the executive officers. The
retention agreement for Mr. Ponton provides for a $2.5 million retention award, 40% of which is payable upon
consummation of the merger and 60% of which is payable on the later of (i) three months from the date of
consummation of the merger or (ii) August 21, 2023. If the merger does not close, 100% of Mr. Ponton’s
retention award would be payable on February 21, 2024. The retention agreements for Messrs. Riesbeck, Dart
and Persson and Ms. Richardson each provide for a $350,000 retention award, 50% of which is payable upon
consummation of the merger and 50% of which is payable on the later of (i) three months after consummation
of the merger or (ii) August 21, 2023. If the merger does not close, 100% of the retention awards for Messrs.
Riesbeck, Dart and Persson would be payable on August 21, 2023; however, if the merger agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to August 21, 2023, 50% of the retention award to Messrs.
Riesbeck, Dart and Persson and Ms. Richardson would be paid within five business days of such termination
and 50% would be payable on August 21, 2023. Each of the retention agreements provides that if the named
executive officer’s employment is terminated by Terminix without cause after consummation of the merger,
the unpaid portion of the retention award will be paid within five business days following the date of
termination of employment.
Excise Tax Reimbursement Plan
In connection with the merger, Terminix may implement a plan pursuant to which each named executive
officer (among other employees) will be entitled to receive a full or partial reimbursement payment in the
event that any payments or benefits provided to such executive officer in connection with the merger
become subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The reimbursement
payments would generally place the executive officers in the same after-tax position as if the excise tax did
not apply to them. The aggregate amount of all such reimbursement payments cannot exceed $10 million,
with the reimbursement payments to be reasonably allocated in a manner that does not result in a payment
being made to any given employee which is disproportionately large when compared to the
109 
st
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
amount by which the employee’s payments subject to the excise tax exceeds the statutorily determined
employee-specific threshold of payments below which the excise tax is not imposed. At this time, no named
executive officer has been granted any rights to receive any such reimbursement payment, and there is no
guarantee that any such payments will be made.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Terminix’s non-employee directors and executive officers will
be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification and
Insurance” beginning on page 158.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Terminix Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation
of each of Terminix’s named executive officers, that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and that
will or may become payable to the named executive officers at the completion of the merger or on a qualifying
termination of employment upon or following the consummation of the merger. This compensation is referred
to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use
such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to the Terminix named executive officers. The
“golden parachute” compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of
Terminix stockholders. The “named executive officers” are the individuals listed as such in Terminix’s most
recent annual proxy statement.
For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion
under the caption “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Transaction” beginning on page 105 above.
Certain Assumptions
The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, the amount of payments
and benefits (on a pre-tax basis) that each of Terminix’s named executive officers would receive based on
certain assumptions set forth below and in the footnotes to the tables. Some of the assumptions used in the
table below are based upon information not currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts to be
received by any of the individuals below may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. The ultimate
values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts
set forth below. Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments
and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
the relevant price per share of Terminix common stock is $43.83, which is the average closing price per
share of Terminix common stock as reported on the NYSE over the first five business days following
the first public announcement of the transaction on December 14, 2021;
the first effective time as referenced in this section occurs on August 15, 2022, which is the assumed
date of the first effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;
the employment of each executive officer of Terminix was terminated by the surviving company
without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason”  (as such terms are
defined in the relevant plans and agreements and set forth below), in either case immediately
following the merger and on the assumed date of the first effective time of August 15, 2022;
the named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from that in
effect as of the date of this filing;
the Terminix restricted stock awards, performance unit awards and other awards outstanding as of the
date hereof (assuming there is no vesting between the date hereof and August 15, 2022); and
each named executive officer has properly executed any required releases and complied with all
requirements (including any applicable restrictive covenants) necessary in order to receive the
payments and benefits.

Cash. Consists of a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of (x) two times the executive
officer’s annual base salary and (y) two times the executive officer’s annual target cash bonus under the
AIP, each as in effect upon the qualifying termination of employment. The cash payments described
above are “double trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment after
a change in control of Terminix under the terms of the applicable arrangement. The amounts shown in
this column are based on compensation and target annual bonus levels assumed to be in effect on
August 15, 2022, which are the same as those in effect on the date of this proxy statement/​prospectus;
therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are changed after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, actual payments to a named executive officer may be different than those
provided for above.
Equity. Reflects (i) the payment for cancellation of all vested, in-the-money Terminix Stock Options at
the first effective time, which is a “single trigger” benefit provided to all holders of outstanding Terminix
Stock Options and (ii) assumed accelerated vesting of unvested Terminix Stock Options, Terminix RSU
Awards and Terminix PSU Awards, which is a “double trigger” benefit provided to all holders of such
outstanding Terminix Stock Options, Terminix RSU Awards and Terminix PSU Awards that becomes
vested and payable upon a qualifying termination of employment within following a change in control of
Terminix. As described above under the heading “The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction - Treatment of Outstanding Terminix Equity
Awards”, beginning on page 106, the value of the Terminix PSU Awards is estimated by deeming the
applicable performance goals achieved for all purposes at the target level of performance.​
For further details regarding the treatment of Terminix equity awards in connection with the merger, see
“The Merger Proposal - Interests of Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction -

Benefits. The “Benefits” column reflects the monthly reimbursements equal to the excess of COBRA
medical continuation coverage (+2%), less the then-active employee medical insurance premium rates
for up to 18 months after the qualifying termination of employment. The cash payments described above
are “double trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment after a

The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting
in accordance with IFRS under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, referred to as IFRS 3. IFRS requires that one
of the two companies in a transaction be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes based on the
evidence available. Rentokil Initial will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. In
identifying Rentokil Initial as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, Rentokil Initial and Terminix took
into account the relative voting rights of all equity instruments, the intended composition of the governing
body and senior management of the combined company and the size of each of the companies. In assessing
the size of each of the companies, Rentokil Initial and Terminix management evaluated various metrics,
including, but not limited to, revenue, profit before taxation, total assets and market capitalization.
Accordingly, Rentokil Initial will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and
liabilities assumed from Terminix at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the transaction.
Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as
goodwill.
The financial condition and results of operations of Rentokil Initial after completion of the transaction will
reflect Terminix after completion of the transaction, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the

interest expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including certain trademarks, and goodwill will not be
amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including
goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, Rentokil Initial
determines that tangible or intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired, Rentokil Initial would record

terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Rentokil Initial and Terminix have each agreed to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction.
This includes (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any governmental authority or other
112 TABLE OF CONTENTS
third party all documentation to effect all filings necessary to complete the transaction and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly
as practicable, and thereafter maintain, all consents from any governmental authority or other third party that

Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and Other Antitrust Authorities
Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the transaction, may not be completed unless certain
waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file
a pre-merger notification with the FTC and the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be
completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their
respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period.
Each of Rentokil Initial and Terminix filed its respective HSR Act notification and report with respect to the
transaction on January 10, 2022. Following informal discussions with the FTC staff, Rentokil Initial notified
the FTC that it elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form under the HSR Act prior to
expiration of the initial waiting period to give the FTC additional time to review the proposed transaction.
Rentokil Initial’s notification and report form was withdrawn effective as of February 9, 2022, and Rentokil
Initial refiled its notification on February 11, 2022, commencing a new 30-calendar-day waiting period under
the HSR Act. The applicable HSR Act waiting period expired on March 14, 2022.
At any time before or after the transaction is completed, the FTC or DOJ could take action under U.S.
antitrust laws in opposition to the transaction, including seeking to enjoin completion of the transaction,
condition approval of the transaction upon the divestiture of assets of Rentokil Initial, Terminix or their
respective affiliates or impose restrictions on Rentokil Initial’s post-transaction operations. In addition, non-
U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take such action under other applicable
regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation,
seeking to enjoin completion of the transaction or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions
or conditions. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some
circumstances.

There can be no assurance that any of the governmental or other entities described above, including the
DOJ, FTC, U.S. state attorneys general, foreign regulators and private parties, will not challenge the
transaction on antitrust, competition, or foreign investment grounds and, if such a challenge is made, there
can be no assurance as to its result.
Subject to certain conditions, if the transaction is not completed on or before the end date (as it may be
extended in accordance with the merger agreement), either Rentokil Initial or Terminix may terminate the
merger agreement. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 160.",126,128

On March 25, 2022, in connection with a previously filed complaint on October 20, 2020, Bruce-Terminix
Company, a licensee of Terminix (“Bruce”), filed the Bruce Lawsuit against Terminix and The Terminix
International Company Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of Terminix. The original complaint generally
alleged, among other things, that certain subsidiaries of Terminix violated the non-compete restriction under
the licensee’s license agreement and the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. As
supplemented, the Bruce Lawsuit further generally alleges, among other things, that a Rentokil Initial
subsidiary currently competes in the licensee’s territory and that the transaction would violate the non-
compete restriction under the licensee’s license agreement. The Bruce Lawsuit also alleges, among other
things, that Bruce would suffer irreparable harm from purported competition with Rentokil Initial should the
transaction be consummated, and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from
merging with Rentokil Initial so long as Rentokil Initial owns pest control companies with locations within
Bruce’s service area and from disclosing to Rentokil Initial certain confidential or proprietary information of
the Company. On August 1, 2022, the court denied Bruce’s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the
transaction. Terminix believes that the claims asserted in the Bruce Lawsuit are without merit.
In connection with the transaction, three complaints have been filed by purported Terminix stockholders
against Terminix and its directors, and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. The complaints are
captioned Ferreiro v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-04987 (S.D.N.Y.); Justice v. Terminix
Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-05519 (S.D.N.Y.); and Baker v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et
al., No. 1:22-cv-05524 (S.D.N.Y.). The draft complaint is captioned Paxton v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.,
et al. and does not specify any court. The complaints and draft complaint generally allege that the
preliminary registration statement filed with the SEC on June 7, 2022 omitted certain allegedly material
information in connection with the transaction in violation of federal proxy laws, and one of the complaints
further alleges that the Terminix directors further breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the
transaction and that Terminix aided and abetted that breach. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including:
enjoining the consummation of the transaction; rescission of the transaction, or rescissory damages in the
event the transaction is consummated without the allegedly material disclosures; declaring the merger
agreement unenforceable; directing dissemination of additional allegedly material disclosures; declaring that
Terminix and its directors violated federal proxy laws; awarding plaintiffs costs and an allowance for
attorneys’ and experts fees; and an accounting to the plaintiffs for any damages allegedly suffered. Given the
early stage of the proceedings, it is impossible to predict the outcome or to estimate possible loss or range of
loss. Rentokil Initial and Terminix believe that the claims asserted in the complaints and draft complaint are
without merit.",128,128

General
If you hold one or more shares of Terminix common stock, you may be entitled to appraisal rights under
Delaware law and have the right to dissent from the transaction, have your shares appraised by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and receive the “fair value” of such shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the transaction) as of the completion of the transaction in place of the
merger consideration, as determined by such court, if you strictly comply with the procedures
114 • 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
specified in Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to certain limitations under the DGCL. Any such Terminix
stockholder awarded “fair value” for their shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in
cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the merger consideration. The following
discussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in
its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached as Annex C to this
proxy statement/prospectus. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a
“stockholder” are to the holder of record of shares of Terminix common stock. The following discussion does
not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your
rights to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, Terminix, not less than 20 days prior to the Terminix special meeting, must
notify each stockholder who was a Terminix stockholder on the record date for notice of the Terminix special
meeting and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights, that appraisal rights are available and include in the
notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required notice
to Terminix stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the transaction. A holder of
Terminix common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so
should review the following discussion and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL as Annex C to this proxy
statement/prospectus carefully. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of
the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights
will be entitled to receive the merger consideration.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. If you are a Terminix stockholder wishing to exercise the
rights to seek an appraisal of your shares, you must do ALL of the following:
you must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is signed and
submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement; if you vote by proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal
rights, you must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting your
shares;
you must deliver to Terminix a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote on the
adoption of the merger agreement at the Terminix special meeting and such demand must reasonably
inform Terminix of your identity and your intention to demand appraisal of your shares of Terminix
common stock;
you must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the completion
of the transaction. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer such shares before the
completion of the transaction; and
you or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of such shares within 120 days after the completion of the transaction.
The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the Terminix
stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of
Terminix common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Voting, electronically at the Terminix special meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or
failing to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as
required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate
from any proxy or vote.
Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights. Only a holder of record of shares of Terminix common stock issued and
outstanding at the time a demand for appraisal is made and that continue to be issued and outstanding and
held of record by such holder immediately prior to the completion of the transaction may assert appraisal
rights for the shares of Terminix common stock registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must
be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as the stockholder’s name
appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand for appraisal must reasonably inform
Terminix of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or
its common stock. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of common stock
115 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of record may not directly make appraisal demands to Terminix. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the
owner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those
shares of common stock of record. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds
shares of Terminix common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with
respect to the shares of Terminix common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising
this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of
Terminix common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Terminix common
stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Terminix common stock
held in the name of the record owner.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND
YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE
FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE
BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE
SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER
PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO
CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
If you own shares of Terminix common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or
tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a
stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact
that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold shares of
Terminix common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities
depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on
behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written
demand to:
Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. 
150 Peabody Place 
Memphis, Tennessee 38103 
Attention: Corporate Secretary
Rentokil Initial’s Actions After the Completion of the Transaction. If the transaction is completed, the
surviving company will give written notice of the completion of the transaction to you within 10 days after
the completion of the transaction if you did not vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and you
made a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days
after the completion of the transaction, if you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a
proceeding as a named party, you have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the merger
consideration in accordance with the merger agreement for your shares of Terminix common stock. Within
120 days after the completion of the transaction, but not later, either you, provided you have complied with
the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, or the surviving company may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving
company in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of
Terminix common stock held by all dissenting stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The
surviving company is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no intention of doing so. If
you desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of
your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the completion of the transaction, provided you have complied with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to receive from the surviving company, upon your written
request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and with respect to which Terminix has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of holders of those shares. The surviving company must mail this statement to you within
116 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the later of 10 days of receipt of the request or 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands
for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of Terminix common stock held in a voting trust or by
a nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving
company the statement described in this paragraph. As noted above, however, a demand for appraisal may
only be made by or on behalf of a holder of record of shares of Terminix common stock. If a petition for
appraisal is duly filed by you or another record holder of Terminix common stock who has properly exercised
his or her appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, the surviving
company will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide
the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed with a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may order the Register in Chancery to give notice of the time and place fixed for
the hearing on the petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving company and to the stockholders
shown on such duly verified list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice will also be published at least
one week before the day of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation published in the City
of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The costs of these notices are borne by the surviving company. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then
determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding
appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss from the proceedings any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. If immediately before a
merger the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights
are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the
proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for
appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the transaction for such total number of shares
exceeds $1 million or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to Section 253 or 267 of the DGCL. The Terminix
common stock is listed on the NYSE and therefore this provision may be applicable in respect thereof, to the
extent that Terminix common stock continues to be listed on the NYSE until immediately before the
transaction.
After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of Terminix common stock, the
appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Terminix common stock owned by such
stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the
fair value of the shares of Terminix common stock at the completion of the transaction held by dissenting
stockholders who have properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the transaction, together with interest, if any, to be paid.
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and
except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the completion of the transaction
through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the completion of the transaction and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving company may pay to each Terminix stockholder entitled
to appraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such
Terminix stockholder), in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together
with interest, if any, by the surviving company to the Terminix stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be
so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and in the case of
holders of shares of Terminix common stock represented by certificates upon the surrender to the surviving
company of such stockholder’s certificates.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
117 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making
this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the
transaction which throw any light on future prospects of the combined company. Section 262 of the DGCL
provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the [transaction].” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that
such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of
future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of
the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of Terminix common stock as determined under
Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger
consideration.
Rentokil Initial does not anticipate offering more than the per share merger consideration to any Terminix
stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of
Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Terminix common stock is less than the per share
merger consideration. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective date of the transaction or,
assuming the shares of Terminix common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately
before the transaction, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied, then all Terminix
stockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the per share merger consideration
described in the merger agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those
costs to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances.
Each Terminix stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and
expert witnesses’ fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Terminix common stock entitled to appraisal.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after
the effective date of the transaction, vote the shares of Terminix common stock subject to the demand for
any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other
distributions payable to holders of record of Terminix common stock as of a record date prior to the effective
date of the transaction.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you may
withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of
the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger to the surviving corporation, except that any
attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written
approval of the surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will
be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval
may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this
provision will not affect the right of any Terminix stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the transaction within 60 days after the
effective date of the transaction. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or
118 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Terminix common stock will be converted into the right
to receive the per share merger consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in
the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger
consideration for your shares of Terminix common stock in accordance with the merger agreement. In view of
the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Terminix stockholder and are
considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and
financial advisor.

Overview
In order to provide financing certainty for the transaction, on December 13, 2021 Rentokil Initial obtained
bridge facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,700 million from Barclays Bank PLC. On
February 25, 2022 such commitments were terminated and replaced with bridge and term facility commitments
having an original aggregate principal amount of $2,700 million consisting of (i) “Facility A”, a bridge facility
having an original aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million, which has since been terminated in full as
described below and (ii) “Facility B”, a term facility having an original aggregate principal amount of $700
million (collectively, the “Financing Commitments”) provided by a syndicate of banks. On March 25, 2022, an
amendment letter was entered into in respect of the Financing Commitments in order to conform the duration
of the Financing Commitments to the end date in the merger agreement. On May 25, 2022, an amendment
letter was entered into in respect of the Financing Commitments in order to permit the Termination Date of
Facility A to be extended to 1 April 2024.
On June 27, 2022, Rentokil Initial and its subsidiary issued (i) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2027 in an
aggregate principal amount of €850 million, (ii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2030 in an aggregate
principal amount of €600 million and (iii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2032 in an aggregate principal
amount of £400 million, in each case pursuant to Rentokil Initial’s Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the
“New Senior Notes”). Following the issuance of the New Senior Notes, on June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial
terminated the Financing Commitments in respect of Facility A. The proceeds of the New Senior Notes have
been converted to $2,000 million using hedging instruments.
The proceeds of Facility B and the New Senior Notes are intended to be used to pay the merger
consideration, certain costs and expenses in connection therewith and for the refinancing of indebtedness of
Terminix and its subsidiaries.
119 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Facility B
Rentokil Initial is the borrower under Facility B. Facility B will mature on the third anniversary of the date of
utilization. Facility B contains standard conditions precedent including, among others, corporate
authorizations and confirmations relating to the closing of the transactions.
The interest rate for loans borrowed pursuant to Facility B is a benchmark rate based on the secured
overnight financing rate for U.S. dollars plus a margin determined pursuant to a ratings-based pricing grid
that ranges between 0.50% per annum and 1.00% per annum. Certain customary commitment, arrangement
and agency fees are payable in respect of the Financing Commitments.
Facility B is (i) prepayable at the option of Rentokil Initial without penalty or premium (other than customary
breakage payments) upon customary terms and (ii) required to be prepaid in certain customary
circumstances, including in the case of illegality or upon change of control. Facility B does not amortize.
Facility B includes representations and warranties and undertakings that are customary for financings of this
type. In particular, Rentokil Initial is required to comply with customary information undertakings to deliver
financial statements, compliance certificates, certain documents distributed to shareholders and information
pertaining to certain litigation, defaults, changes in credit rating or relating to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. Rentokil Initial is also required to comply with, and ensure that its subsidiaries
comply with, general undertakings that restrict the ability of members of the Rentokil Initial group, subject to
certain enumerated exceptions, to grant security interests, incur indebtedness (in the case of certain
members of the Rentokil Initial group), make disposals or asset sales, make extensions of credit, become
liable with respect to certain trade instruments, change the nature of its business or enter into certain
fundamental transactions of amalgamation, merger or reconstruction. There are no financial performance
maintenance covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, Rentokil Initial’s obligations
under Facility B may, subject to certain limitations during a customary “certain funds” period, be accelerated
and the lending commitments terminated. Events of default include failure to pay, failure to comply with
undertakings (after expiration of a grace period in the case of a failure capable of cure), inaccuracy of
representations in a material respect (after expiration of a grace period in the case of misrepresentations
capable of cure), cross-default to certain other financial indebtedness of Rentokil Initial and its subsidiaries,
insolvency events, repudiation by Rentokil Initial and any event or series or events that has a “material
adverse effect” on the ability of Rentokil Initial to perform its obligations under the facilities or on the
validity or enforceability of the documentation in respect thereof.

New Senior Notes
Rentokil Initial is the issuer of the senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2032 in an aggregate principal
amount of £400 million (the “2032 Notes”), and is the guarantor of the senior unsecured notes due June 27,
2027 in an aggregate principal amount of €850 million (the “2027 Notes”), and the senior unsecured notes due
June 27, 2030 in an aggregate principal amount of €600 million (the “2030 Notes”), each of which were issued
by Rentokil Initial Finance B.V.
The interest rates for the 2027 Notes, the 2030 Notes and the 2032 Notes are 3.875% per annum, 4.375% per
annum and 5.000% per annum respectively. Each of the New Senior Notes have very similar terms, each
containing a negative pledge given by the relevant issuer and Rentokil Initial (as guarantor) that for so long
as any of the New Senior Notes remain outstanding, neither the relevant issuer nor Rentokil Initial (as
guarantor) will, and Rentokil Initial will procure that none of its subsidiaries will, create or permit to subsist
any mortgage, lien, pledge or other charge (each a “Security Interest”) upon, or with respect to, any of its
present or future business, undertaking, assets or revenues to secure any existing or future relevant
indebtedness of any person or any guarantee or indemnity given in respect thereof, unless simultaneously
120 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
with, or prior to, the creation of such Security Interest, the New Senior Notes, the guarantee and the trust
deed relating to the New Senior Notes are secured equally and rateably by such Security Interests. This
negative pledge shall not apply with regards to a Security Interest provided by or in respect of a company
becoming a subsidiary of Rentokil Initial after the issue date, or where such Security Interest exists at the
time that company becomes a subsidiary of Rentokil Initial (provided it was not created in contemplation of
that company becoming such a subsidiary and the principal amount secured is not subsequently increased).
Each of the New Senior Notes may be repaid early in a number of circumstances and for a number of
customary reasons, including (i) if the relevant issuer is obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of the
relevant series of New Senior Notes pursuant to their terms as a result of a change in, or amendment to, or in

The following discussion is a general summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of
exchanging their shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the transaction
and to U.S. Holders of holding and disposing of Rentokil Initial ADSs received in the transaction. This
discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (which we refer
to as the “Treasury Regulations”), judicial authorities and published positions of the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”), all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth herein. This discussion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts,
and neither Rentokil Initial nor Terminix intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax
consequences described herein. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or
that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth in this discussion.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and is not a complete description of all tax
considerations that may be relevant to holders of Terminix common stock; it is not a substitute for tax advice.
It applies only to holders that hold their shares of Terminix common stock, and will hold the Rentokil Initial
ADSs received in the transaction, as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221(a) of the
121 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Code (generally, property held for investment) and that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. In
addition, it does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a
holder of Terminix common stock in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, nor does it apply to
holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as banks or other financial
institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities and organizations, dealers or brokers, traders in
securities that elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, governmental agencies or instrumentalities,
mutual funds, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships and other pass-
through entities (including S-corporations) and investors therein, U.S. expatriates, pension funds, individual
retirement and other deferred accounts, “controlled foreign corporations, “passive foreign investment
companies,” “personal holding companies,” persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons required
to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an
“applicable financial statement,” persons that directly, indirectly or constructively, own or at any time during
the five year period ending on the closing date owned, 5% or more of the total combined voting power of
Terminix’s or Rentokil Initial’s voting stock or of the total value of Terminix’s or Rentokil Initial’s equity
interests, persons who received their shares of Terminix common stock through the exercise of employee
stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan, holders of Terminix
common stock who exercise appraisal rights, U.S. Holders that hold their shares of Terminix common stock,
or who will hold the Rentokil Initial ADSs, in connection with a permanent establishment or fixed base
outside the United States, or holders that hold their shares of Terminix common stock or Rentokil Initial
ADSs as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated or risk reduction
financial transaction. This summary also does not address any considerations relating to U.S. federal taxes
other than income tax (such as estate or gift taxes), any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax laws or
considerations, the Medicare tax on net investment income, any considerations with respect to any
withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and any intergovernmental agreements entered in connection therewith
and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement), or, except as
expressly addressed below, any reporting requirements.
As used in this section, “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Terminix common stock, and,
after the exchange of shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the
transaction, a beneficial owner of Rentokil Initial ADSs received in the transaction, that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes: (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity
or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (iv) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal
income taxation regardless of its source.
A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Terminix common stock, and, after the exchange of
shares of Terminix common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the transaction, a beneficial owner
of Rentokil Initial ADSs received in the transaction, who is an individual, corporation, estate or trust, in each
case, that is not a U.S. Holder.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) exchanging its shares of Terminix common stock for the
merger consideration, or holding or disposing of Rentokil Initial ADSs, generally will depend on the status of
the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and persons treated as partners in partnerships
that hold shares of Terminix common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific U.S.
federal income tax consequences to them of participating in the transaction and acquiring, owning and
disposing of Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.
The following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis or discussion of all U.S. federal income tax
considerations relating to the transaction or to the ownership and disposition of Rentokil Initial shares. All holders of
Terminix common stock should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the
transaction and of the ownership and disposition of Rentokil Initial shares, including with respect to reporting
requirements and the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws in light of their
particular circumstances.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
This discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” assumes that a U.S. Holder of
Rentokil Initial ADSs, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally will be treated as the owner of the
underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares that are represented by such Rentokil Initial ADSs. Accordingly,
deposits or withdrawals of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares in exchange for Rentokil Initial ADSs will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax. For purposes of this discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences”, Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares will be referred to as “Rentokil
Initial shares.”
Under Section 367(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, special rules may apply to a U.S.
Holder that actually or constructively owns 5% or more, by vote or value, of the issued and outstanding
stock of Rentokil Initial immediately after the completion of the transaction. Any such U.S. Holder is urged to
consult his, her or its tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction with
regard to such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances.
Based on the composition of Rentokil Initial’s current gross assets and income and the manner in which
Rentokil Initial expects to operate its business in future years, Rentokil Initial believes, and the following
discussion assumes, that Rentokil Initial will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a
“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its current taxable year and does not expect to be so
classified in the foreseeable future. The tests to determine whether a company is a PFIC apply annually and a
company’s status can change depending, among other things, on changes in the composition and relative
value of its gross receipts and assets, changes in its operations and changes in the market value of its stock.
Accordingly, Rentokil Initial can provide no assurance that it will not be a PFIC for its current taxable year
and can provide no assurance that it will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year. If Rentokil Initial were
to be a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owned Rentokil Initial shares, such U.S. Holder
generally would be subject, in that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years (whether or not Rentokil
Initial continued to be a PFIC), to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including that
gain from the sale or other disposition of Rentokil Initial shares as well as certain distributions on Rentokil
Initial shares would be subject to tax at the highest ordinary income tax rates and an interest charge and U.S.
Holders would be subject to additional information reporting requirements. U.S. Holders should consult their
own tax advisors as to the potential application of the PFIC rules.
Tax Residence of Rentokil Initial
A corporation organized under non-U.S. law, such as Rentokil Initial, is generally treated as a foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under Section 7874 of the Code, a corporation otherwise
treated as a foreign corporation may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or
may be subject to certain other adverse tax consequences) if it acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially
all of the assets held, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. corporation. These rules apply only if certain conditions
are met, including that the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by reason of their
ownership of shares of that U.S. corporation, more than a specified percentage of the shares of the acquiring
foreign corporation. Based on the percentage of the Rentokil Initial shares to be received by shareholders of
Terminix in the transaction, Rentokil Initial does not expect these conditions to be met and thus Rentokil
Initial does not expect Rentokil Initial’s indirect acquisition of Terminix to cause Rentokil Initial to be treated
as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise to be subject to Section 7874 of the
Code. However, the ownership of Rentokil Initial for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code must be finally
determined after the completion of the transaction, by which time there could be adverse changes to the
relevant facts and circumstances. If Rentokil Initial were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or otherwise to be subject to Section 7874 of the Code, Rentokil Initial and its
subsidiaries could be subject to substantial additional U.S. tax liability, its non-U.S. shareholders could be
subject to U.S. withholding tax on any dividends and its U.S. shareholders could be subject to a higher rate
of tax on any dividends. This discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” assumes
that Rentokil Initial will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and has not
otherwise been nor will be subject to Section 7874 of the Code.
U.S. Federal Income Taxation of the Transaction
The Transaction
The obligation of Terminix to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Terminix, or Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rentokil Initial, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the first merger and the second merger, taken together
as an integrated transaction, will qualify (A) as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and (B) for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code. This opinion will be based
on certain assumptions, representations and warranties and covenants, including those contained in the
merger agreement and in tax representation letters provided by Rentokil Initial (on behalf of itself, Bidco,
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II) and Terminix. If any of these assumptions, representations and warranties
or covenants underlying the tax opinion described above is or becomes incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate or
is violated, the validity of, and the conclusions reached in, such tax opinion may be affected or jeopardized,
and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction could differ materially from those discussed
below. In addition, the opinion will be subject to certain qualifications and limitations as set forth therein.
Moreover, the opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither Rentokil Initial nor Terminix
intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the transaction.
Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth in such opinion or the tax consequences described in
the discussion below. In particular, if the transaction does not qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the transaction would be treated as a fully taxable transaction for such purposes, in
which case, a U.S. Holder would be required to recognize any gain or loss on its exchange of shares of
Terminix common stock for the merger consideration. If the transaction does qualify as a reorganization but
does not qualify for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, a U.S. Holder would be
required to recognize the full amount of any gain, but not loss, on its exchange of shares of Terminix common
stock for the merger consideration. In certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder could be subject to U.S.
federal income and/or withholding tax on its exchange of Terminix common stock for the merger
consideration if the transaction does not qualify as a reorganization.
On the basis of the opinion described above that the transaction will be treated as a “reorganization” within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and will qualify for an exception to the general rule of Section
367(a)(1) of the Code, the following discussion under “Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Terminix
Common Stock of the Transaction” and “Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Terminix Common Stock
of the Transaction” describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S.
Holders and Non-U.S. Holders of Terminix common stock.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Terminix Common Stock of the Transaction
A U.S. Holder (assuming, in the case of any such U.S. Holder that would be treated as a “five-percent
transferee shareholder”  (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Rentokil
Initial following the transaction, that such U.S. Holder enters into a five-year gain recognition agreement in
the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8):
that exchanges its shares of Terminix common stock solely for Rentokil Initial shares in the
transaction will generally not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except
in respect of cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any;
that exchanges its shares of Terminix common stock solely for cash in the transaction will generally
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
(excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any) received by such U.S.
Holder in the transaction and such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock
exchanged; and
that exchanges its shares of Terminix common stock for a combination of Rentokil Initial shares and
cash in the transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of:
(i) the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any)
received by such U.S. Holder in the transaction; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the
amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any) plus the
fair market value of the Rentokil Initial shares (including any fractional Rentokil Initial shares deemed
received) received by such U.S. Holder in exchange for its shares of Terminix common stock in the
transaction, over (b) such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock exchanged.
124 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A U.S. Holder’s basis in its Terminix common stock will generally be equal to the amount paid for such stock.
Subject to the discussion below regarding potential dividend treatment, any such gain or loss will generally
be capital gain or loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the
effective time, the U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the surrendered shares of Terminix common
stock exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. Holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates.
Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.
In certain circumstances, cash consideration received in a transaction otherwise qualifying as a
reorganization may be characterized as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes rather than capital
gain where the payment of such cash consideration has the effect of a distribution of a dividend. Whether
the payment of such consideration has such effect is generally determined by treating the cash as if it were
the proceeds of a hypothetical redemption by the acquirer (or its parent) of additional share consideration
deemed issued in the acquisition. If the receipt of cash in such deemed redemption would be treated as a
distribution to the U.S. Holder with respect to Rentokil Initial under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the
Code, the gain recognized pursuant to the transaction by such U.S. Holder would be treated as dividend
income to the extent of such U.S. Holder’s ratable share of the accumulated earnings and profits of Terminix
as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS has ruled that gain is generally not
recharacterized as a dividend under this rule in the case of an exchanging shareholder in a public corporation
whose relative stock interest is minimal and who exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs. Based
on this and other applicable legal authority, and on the relevant facts (including the relative amount of the
cash component of the merger consideration), the cash consideration received by Terminix stockholders in
the transaction is generally not expected to be treated as a dividend for such exchanging shareholders.
However, these rules are complex and because the possibility of dividend treatment depends upon each U.S.
Holder’s particular circumstances, including the application of constructive ownership rules, U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to them.
The aggregate tax basis of the Rentokil Initial shares a U.S. Holder receives in the transaction (including any
fractional Rentokil Initial shares deemed received) will generally be the same as such U.S. Holder’s aggregate
tax basis in its shares of Terminix common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, decreased by the amount
of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any), if any, such U.S. Holder
receives and increased by the amount of gain (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash received
in lieu of fractional Rentokil Initial shares, if any), if any, such U.S. Holder recognizes in the transaction. The
holding period of the Rentokil Initial shares received by a U.S. Holder in the transaction will include such
U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares of Terminix common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
In the case of a U.S. Holder who holds shares of Terminix common stock with differing tax bases and/or
holding periods, which generally occurs when blocks of shares are purchased at different times or at
different prices, the preceding rules must be applied separately to each identifiable block of shares of
Terminix common stock, and such U.S. Holder may not offset a loss realized on one block of the shares
against gain recognized on another block of the shares.
A U.S. Holder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional Rentokil Initial share in the transaction generally will
be treated as having received such fractional share in the transaction and then as having received cash in
exchange for such fractional Rentokil Initial share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the
difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional Rentokil Initial share and the portion
of the U.S. Holder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares of Terminix common stock surrendered allocable to the
fractional Rentokil Initial share. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the shares of Terminix common stock is more than one
year on the closing date of the transaction. A non-corporate U.S. Holder’s long-term capital gain may be
taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Terminix Common Stock of the Transaction

Terminix common stock for Rentokil Initial shares, cash or a combination of Rentokil Initial shares and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
cash in the transaction will be the same as those described above for a U.S. Holder, except that a Non-U.S.
Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax on any gain recognized in
connection with the transaction unless:
the gain (if any) is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or
business (and, where a tax treaty applies, is attributable to the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. permanent
establishment or fixed base in the United States), in which case such gain would be taxed on a net
income basis in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. person (and, if such Non-
U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Non-U.S. Holder may be
subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an
applicable income tax treaty);
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States for at least 183 days during the
taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case such Non-U.S.
Holder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on the amount by
which such Non-U.S. Holder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from the
disposition pursuant to the transaction, exceed any capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except
as otherwise required by an applicable income tax treaty; or
Terminix is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (a “USRPHC”), as defined in
Section 897 of the Code at any time within the five-year period preceding the transaction and
certain other conditions are satisfied. Terminix believes that, as of the effective time of the
transaction, Terminix will not have been a USRPHC at any time within the five-year period ending
on the date thereof.
U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders of Rentokil Initial Shares
Dividends
The gross amount of any distribution of cash with respect to Rentokil Initial shares will be included in a U.S.
Holder’s gross income as a dividend to the extent of Rentokil Initial’s current or accumulated earnings and
profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax laws. Rentokil Initial does not expect to maintain
calculations of earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a U.S. Holder should
expect that any such distribution will generally be treated as a dividend from foreign sources when actually
or constructively received. Dividends generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction
generally available to U.S. corporations. Dividends received from a “qualified foreign corporation” by
eligible non-corporate U.S. Holders that satisfy a minimum holding period and certain other requirements
generally will be taxed at the preferential rate applicable to qualified dividend income. Rentokil Initial will be
treated as a qualified foreign corporation if its shares or ADSs are readily tradable on an established
securities market in the United States or Rentokil Initial qualifies for comprehensive benefits under the U.S.-
UK income tax treaty and Rentokil Initial has not become and does not become a “surrogate foreign
corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes after December 22, 2017 and, in each case, Rentokil Initial
is not a PFIC for either the taxable year of distribution or the preceding taxable year. U.S. Treasury guidance
indicates that shares listed on the NYSE will be considered readily tradable on an established securities
market in the United States. There can be no assurance, however, that Rentokil Initial shares will be
considered readily tradable on an established securities market in future years. Rentokil Initial does not
believe that it is a surrogate foreign corporation but can provide no assurance that it is not a surrogate
foreign corporation and can provide no assurance that it will not become a surrogate foreign corporation.
Dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount based
on the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is includible in the U.S. Holder’s income, whether or
not the currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the non-U.S. currency
will equal the U.S. dollar amount included in income. Any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion
or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency for a different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S. source
ordinary income or loss. If dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S.
dollars on the day they are received, a U.S. Holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign
currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income.
126 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Sales or Other Dispositions of Rentokil Initial Shares
A U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of Rentokil Initial
shares in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the disposed Rentokil Initial shares. Any gain or loss generally will be treated
as arising from U.S. sources and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period
exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. Holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates.
Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, information reporting requirements may apply to the cash payments made to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders in connection with the transaction and in respect of Rentokil Initial shares, unless an
exemption applies. Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the applicable
stockholder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, fails to report all interest and
dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns or otherwise fails to establish an
exemption to backup withholding. U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders can claim a credit against their U.S.
federal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess,
provided that all required information is timely provided to the IRS. U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the
procedure for establishing an exemption.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY
BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTION AND
OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF RENTOKIL INITIAL SHARES WILL DEPEND ON A HOLDER’S SPECIFIC
SITUATION. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THE HOLDER OF THE TRANSACTION AND HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF RENTOKIL
INITIAL SHARES IN LIGHT OF THE HOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY
AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
Material UK Tax Consequences of Owning Rentokil Initial Ordinary Shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs
The following statements are intended only as a general guide to certain UK tax considerations and do not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential UK tax consequences relating to the holding or disposing
of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs. Save as set out in paragraph C(i), these
statements do not purport to provide any analysis of the UK tax consequences of the transaction or of the
tax position of Rentokil Initial, Terminix, Bidco or Merger Subs. They are based on current UK law and what
is understood to be the current practice of HM Revenue & Customs as of the date of this proxy
statement/​prospectus, both of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Save where expressly stated otherwise, the following statements apply only to Terminix stockholders who (i)
are not resident nor, in the case of individuals, domiciled in the UK for UK tax purposes, (ii) hold Terminix
common stock, and, following the transaction, Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs as an
investment and (iii) are, for UK tax purposes, the absolute beneficial owner of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
or Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs (as applicable) and any dividends
paid on such Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or such Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil
Initial ADSs. The tax position of certain categories of Terminix stockholders who are subject to special rules
is not considered and who, it should be noted, may incur liabilities to UK tax on a different basis to that
described below. This includes persons holding Terminix stock or, following the transaction, Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs acquired in connection with an employment, dealers in securities,
insurance companies, collective investment schemes, charities or exempt pension funds.
The following statements summarize the current position and are intended as a general guide only. They do not
constitute tax advice. Terminix stockholders who are in any doubt as to their UK tax position, or who may be subject to
tax in a jurisdiction other than the UK, are strongly recommended to consult their own professional advisers.

Sales or Other Dispositions of Rentokil Initial Shares
A U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of Rentokil Initial
shares in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the disposed Rentokil Initial shares. Any gain or loss generally will be treated
as arising from U.S. sources and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period
exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. Holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates.
Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, information reporting requirements may apply to the cash payments made to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders in connection with the transaction and in respect of Rentokil Initial shares, unless an
exemption applies. Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the applicable
stockholder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, fails to report all interest and
dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns or otherwise fails to establish an
exemption to backup withholding. U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders can claim a credit against their U.S.
federal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess,
provided that all required information is timely provided to the IRS. U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the
procedure for establishing an exemption.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY
BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTION AND
OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF RENTOKIL INITIAL SHARES WILL DEPEND ON A HOLDER’S SPECIFIC
SITUATION. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THE HOLDER OF THE TRANSACTION AND HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF RENTOKIL
INITIAL SHARES IN LIGHT OF THE HOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY
AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
Material UK Tax Consequences of Owning Rentokil Initial Ordinary Shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs
The following statements are intended only as a general guide to certain UK tax considerations and do not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential UK tax consequences relating to the holding or disposing
of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs. Save as set out in paragraph C(i), these
statements do not purport to provide any analysis of the UK tax consequences of the transaction or of the
tax position of Rentokil Initial, Terminix, Bidco or Merger Subs. They are based on current UK law and what
is understood to be the current practice of HM Revenue & Customs as of the date of this proxy
statement/​prospectus, both of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Save where expressly stated otherwise, the following statements apply only to Terminix stockholders who (i)
are not resident nor, in the case of individuals, domiciled in the UK for UK tax purposes, (ii) hold Terminix
common stock, and, following the transaction, Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs as an
investment and (iii) are, for UK tax purposes, the absolute beneficial owner of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
or Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil Initial ADSs (as applicable) and any dividends
paid on such Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or such Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by Rentokil
Initial ADSs. The tax position of certain categories of Terminix stockholders who are subject to special rules
is not considered and who, it should be noted, may incur liabilities to UK tax on a different basis to that
described below. This includes persons holding Terminix stock or, following the transaction, Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs acquired in connection with an employment, dealers in securities,
insurance companies, collective investment schemes, charities or exempt pension funds.
The following statements summarize the current position and are intended as a general guide only. They do not
constitute tax advice. Terminix stockholders who are in any doubt as to their UK tax position, or who may be subject to
tax in a jurisdiction other than the UK, are strongly recommended to consult their own professional advisers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
A. Taxation of Disposals of Rentokil Initial Ordinary Shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs
Holders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs who are not resident in the UK should not
generally be subject to UK taxation of capital gains on the disposal or deemed disposal of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs unless they are carrying on a trade, profession or vocation in the
UK through a branch or agency there (or, in the case of a corporate holder, they are carrying on a trade in the
UK through a permanent establishment there) in connection with which the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
or Rentokil Initial ADSs are used, held or acquired.
Non-UK tax resident holders may be subject to non-UK taxation on any gain under local law.
An individual holder of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs who has been resident for tax
purposes in the UK but who ceases to be so resident or becomes treated as resident outside the UK for the
purposes of a double tax treaty for a period of five years or less and who disposes of all or part of his or her
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs during that period may be liable to capital gains tax
on his or her return to the UK, subject to any available exemptions or reliefs.
B. Taxation of Dividends Received from Rentokil Initial
Rentokil Initial is not required to withhold UK tax when paying a dividend. Holders resident outside the UK
should generally not be subject to UK taxation on dividend income unless they are carrying on a trade,
profession or vocation through a branch or agency in the UK (or, in the case of a corporate holder, they are
carrying on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment there) and the dividends are either a receipt
of that trade, profession or vocation (or, in the case of a corporate holder, the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
or Rentokil Initial ADSs are used by, or held by or for, that UK permanent establishment). Holders resident
outside the UK should consult their own tax adviser concerning their tax position on dividends received
from Rentokil Initial.
C. UK Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (Which We Refer to as “SDRT”)
The statements in this paragraph C. apply to any holders of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs
irrespective of their residence, summarize the current position and are intended as a general guide only. Special rules
apply to agreements made by, amongst others, intermediaries.
Consequences of the transaction
Terminix stockholders should not be liable to pay any UK stamp duty or SDRT in respect of the issuance of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs pursuant to the transaction.
Subsequent transfers of underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on cancellation of Rentokil Initial
ADSs
The transfer of underlying Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs in exchange for
the cancellation of such Rentokil Initial ADSs should not give rise to a UK stamp duty or SDRT charge.
Subsequent transfers of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares in other circumstances
UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% (rounded up to the next multiple of £5) of the amount or value of the
consideration given is generally payable on a physical instrument transferring Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares. (A charge to SDRT will also arise on an unconditional agreement to transfer Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares (at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration payable). However, if within six years
of the date of the agreement becoming unconditional an instrument of transfer is executed pursuant to the
agreement, and UK stamp duty is paid on that instrument, any SDRT already paid should be refunded
(generally, but not necessarily, with interest) provided that a claim for repayment is made, and any
outstanding liability to SDRT should be cancelled.) An exemption from UK stamp duty is available on an
instrument transferring Rentokil Initial ordinary shares where the amount or value of the consideration is
£1,000 or less, and it is certified on the instrument that the transaction effected by the instrument does not
form part of a larger transaction or series of transactions for which the aggregate consideration exceeds
£1,000. The liability to pay UK stamp duty or SDRT is generally satisfied by the purchaser or transferee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Paperless transfers of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, such as those occurring within CREST, are generally
liable to SDRT, rather than UK stamp duty, at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration.
CREST is obliged to collect SDRT on relevant transactions settled within the system. The charge is generally
borne by the purchaser. Under the CREST system, no UK stamp duty or SDRT should arise on a transfer of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares into the system unless such a transfer is made (or deemed to be made) for a
consideration in money or money’s worth, in which case a liability to SDRT (usually at a rate of 0.5%) will
arise.
In cases where Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are transferred to a connected company (or its nominee),
SDRT (or UK stamp duty) may be chargeable on the higher of (i) the amount or value of the consideration
and (ii) the market value of the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares held through Clearance Systems or Depositary Receipt Arrangements
Special rules apply where Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are issued or transferred to, or to a nominee or
agent for, either a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts or a person providing a
clearance service. SDRT or UK stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5%, with subsequent transfers
within the clearance service or transfers of depositary receipts then being free from SDRT or UK stamp duty.
HMRC previously accepted that this charge is in breach of EU law so far as it applies to new issues of shares
or transfers that are an integral part of a capital raising. Following the UK’s departure from the EU, such pre-
existing EU rights, recognized in litigation, were preserved as a domestic law matter following the end of the
implementation period on 31 December 2020 pursuant to provisions of the UK European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018. Accordingly, no SDRT or UK stamp duty is payable upon the issue of Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares to a clearance service or depositary (or upon the transfer of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to a
clearance service or depositary where such transfer is integral to the raising of capital by Rentokil Initial).
HMRC’s published view is that the 1.5% SDRT or UK stamp duty charge continued to apply to other
transfers of shares into a clearance service or depositary receipt arrangement, although this has been
disputed. Further litigation indicates that certain transfers of legal title to clearance services in connection
with listing, but not integral to a new issue, are also not chargeable. In view of the continuing uncertainty,
specific professional advice should be sought before incurring a 1.5% UK stamp duty or SDRT charge in any
circumstances.
Subsequent transfers of Rentokil Initial ADSs
Provided there is no written instrument of transfer, transfers of the Rentokil Initial ADSs for consideration
should not attract a charge to UK stamp duty. Paperless transfers of Rentokil Initial ADSs held by DTC
should not incur an SDRT charge.

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to Section 14A of the U.S. Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, Terminix is required to
submit to a non-binding, advisory stockholder vote certain compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Terminix’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transaction as
disclosed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - Interests of
Terminix’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction” beginning on page 105. The compensation
proposal gives Terminix stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related
compensation of Terminix’s named executive officers.
Accordingly, Terminix is asking Terminix stockholders to vote “FOR” the adoption of the following
resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Terminix’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transaction, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger Proposal -  Interests of Terminix’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Transaction -  Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Terminix
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger,” including the associated narrative
discussion and the agreements, plans, arrangements or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger
agreement. Accordingly, if you are a Terminix stockholder, you may vote to approve the merger proposal, and
vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. The vote on the compensation proposal is
advisory and non-binding. As a result, if the transaction is completed, the merger-related compensation may
be paid to Terminix’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of the
compensation agreements and arrangements even if Terminix stockholders do not approve the compensation
proposal.
The Terminix board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the compensation proposal.
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of
Terminix common stock present in person (including virtually via the Internet) or represented by proxy at the
Terminix special meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the compensation proposal, assuming a
quorum is present. A broker non-vote or a Terminix stockholder’s failure to return or submit a proxy and to
attend the Terminix special meeting will have no effect on the compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is
present), but the failure of any shares present or represented at the Terminix special meeting and entitled to
vote on the proposal to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the compensation proposal.
IF YOU ARE A TERMINIX STOCKHOLDER, THE TERMINIX BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 2).

Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Terminix and Rentokil Initial, the closing of the transaction will take
place at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the fifth business day following the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, waiver of the conditions to the completion of the transaction (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the transaction, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of such conditions by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof at the closing of the transaction) described under the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Transaction”
beginning on page 141 or, if such date would fall on or after the end date, then on the business day
immediately preceding the end date.
At the closing, the parties will file certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
to effectuate the transaction. The first merger will become effective when the first certificate of merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at a later time as agreed by Terminix
and Rentokil Initial as specified in such certificate of merger. The second merger will become effective when
the second certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
a later time as agreed by Terminix and Rentokil Initial as specified in such certificate of merger. At the second
effective time, all of the rights, powers, privileges and franchises of Terminix and Merger Sub II and all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of Terminix and Merger Sub II will vest in the surviving
company.
Terminix and Rentokil Initial expect to complete the transaction on October 12, 2022, assuming the merger
proposal is approved by Terminix stockholders on October 6, 2022 and the other conditions to closing
(described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - 
Conditions to Completion of the Transaction” beginning on page 141) are satisfied (including approval of
the Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals by Rentokil Initial shareholders on October 6, 2022).
Merger Consideration
At the first effective time, by virtue of the first merger and without any action on the part of the parties to the
merger agreement or any Terminix stockholder, each share of Terminix common stock (other than excluded
shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive (and, immediately following such conversion,
those shares of Terminix common stock will be automatically cancelled and cease to exist (the
“Cancellation”)), at the election of the holders of such shares, either the stock consideration or cash
consideration. Any Terminix stockholder who does not make an election will be deemed to have made an
election to receive the stock consideration.
The total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid under
the terms of the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual election preferences. The Rentokil
Initial ADSs issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE and are expected to trade
under the symbol “RTO.” Based on the number of shares of Terminix common stock and Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares outstanding on August 31, 2022, immediately after completion of the transaction, we expect
that former Terminix stockholders who receive Rentokil Initial ADSs in the transaction would own Rentokil
Initial ADSs representing approximately 25.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial, and
Rentokil Initial shareholders immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 74.3% of the
outstanding ordinary shares of Rentokil Initial.
The value of the per share cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration as of the
measurement day will be substantially the same. For example, as of July 15, 2022 (which date has been
selected solely for illustrative purposes), Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted share price was £5.0825
(expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar
exchange rate was 1.1855. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would be
$30.13 and, accordingly, subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, as
described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of
Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135:

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $42.99 which is (A) $11.00, the
per share cash amount, plus (B) $31.99, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.13, the
Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date; and
the per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4270 (which
have an approximate value as of such date of $42.99) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)
0.3651, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.13, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as
of such date.
As a result, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per
share stock consideration was approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock.
The market value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders will fluctuate with the market price of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and will not be known at the time that Terminix stockholders vote on the
transaction. Based on Rentokil Initial’s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day
average of the Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to
December 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was
approximately $55.00 per share of Terminix common stock. As described in the prior paragraph, based on
Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted average share price and the spot Sterling-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, in
each case, as of July 15, 2022, the implied value of the merger consideration to Terminix stockholders was
approximately $42.99 per share of Terminix common stock. To further demonstrate how the implied value of
the merger consideration may fluctuate over time, we note that as of August 31, 2022 (the latest practicable
date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus), Rentokil Initial’s volume weighted share price was
£5.2331 (expressed in whole pounds sterling and pence, to four decimal places) and the spot Sterling-U.S.
Dollar exchange rate was 1.1638. If such date were the measurement day, the Rentokil Initial ADS price would
be $30.45 and, accordingly, subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, as
described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Allocation of
Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 135:
the per share cash consideration would be an amount in cash equal to $43.33 which is (A) $11.00, the
per share cash amount, plus (B) $32.33, the product of 1.0619, the exchange ratio, and $30.45, the
Rentokil Initial ADS price as of such date; and
the per share stock consideration would be a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to 1.4231 (which
have an approximate value on such date of $43.33) which is (A) 1.0619, the exchange ratio, plus (B)
0.3612, the quotient of $11.00, the per share cash amount, and $30.45, the Rentokil Initial ADS price as
of such date.
As a result, as of August 31, 2022, the implied value of each of the per share cash consideration and the per
share stock consideration was approximately $43.33 per share of Terminix common stock.
The market price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and the implied value of the merger consideration, could
be greater than, less than or the same as their market price or implied value, as applicable, on the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Terminix special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain
current market quotations for Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock before deciding
how to vote with respect to the merger proposal. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and Terminix common stock
are traded on the LSE and the NYSE, under the symbols “RTO” and “TMX,” respectively. The price of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares is reported in pounds sterling.
Stock Consideration
The merger agreement provides that each share of Terminix common stock with respect to which (x) an
election to receive the stock consideration (each, a “stock electing share”) has been effectively made and not
revoked or lost or (y) an election has not effectively been made prior to the election deadline (each, a “non-
electing share”) will automatically convert at the first effective time into the right to receive a number of
Rentokil Initial ADSs (each representing a beneficial interest in five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) equal to
(A) the exchange ratio plus (B) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of the per share cash amount
and the Rentokil Initial ADS price.

the product of (i) the sum of the total number of stock electing shares and non-electing shares and (ii)

then each stock electing share and each non-electing share will be converted into the right to receive:
a prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs (the “prorated stock amount”) equal to the product
(rounded to four decimal places) of (1) the stock consideration and (2) a fraction, the numerator of
which will be the available stock election amount and the denominator of which will be the stock
election amount; and
an amount of cash (without interest) in U.S. dollars (rounded down to the nearest cent) equal to the
product of (1) (A) the stock consideration minus (B) the prorated stock amount and (2) the Rentokil
Initial ADS price. Such cash amount will be equivalent to the value of the amount of stock
consideration owed in excess of the prorated number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, with such stock
consideration valued based on the volume weighted average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial
ADSs (measured using the volume weighted average price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
multiplied by the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS)
for the measurement day.
Cash Consideration
The merger agreement provides that each share of Terminix common stock with respect to which an election
to receive cash consideration (each, a “cash electing share”) has been effectively made and not revoked or
lost will convert at the first effective time into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, and in
U.S. dollars (rounded down to the nearest cent) equal to (A) the per share cash amount plus (B) the product
of the exchange ratio and the Rentokil Initial ADS price.
Proration. Notwithstanding anything contained in the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, if
the cash consideration is oversubscribed such that:
the product of the number of cash electing shares and the cash consideration (such product being
the “cash election amount”) exceeds
the product of the per share cash amount and the total number of shares of Terminix common stock
(other than certain excluded shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the first effective
time (the “available cash election amount”),
then each cash electing share shall be converted into a right to receive:
a prorated amount in cash (without interest) in U.S. dollars (rounded down to the nearest cent) (the
“prorated cash amount”) equal to the product of (1) the cash consideration and (2) a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the available cash election amount and the denominator of which shall be
the cash election amount; and
a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of (1) (A) the
cash consideration minus (B) the prorated cash amount and (2) the Rentokil Initial ADS price. Such
number of Rentokil Initial ADSs will have a value equivalent to the amount of cash consideration
owed in excess of the prorated cash amount, and will be valued based on the volume weighted
average price (in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil Initial ADSs (measured using the volume weighted average
price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares multiplied by the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
represented by each Rentokil Initial ADS) for the measurement day.
Cash/Stock Election
At least 20 business days prior to the anticipated closing date, the form of election will be mailed to all
record holders of Terminix common stock as of September 6, 2022. The form of election will allow each

The aggregate amount of cash and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be paid and issued,
respectively, to Terminix stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement will not vary as a result of individual
election preferences. If the elections of all of the Terminix stockholders (or failures to make an election) result
in an oversubscription or undersubscription of the available cash election amount, the aggregate amount of
cash payable by Rentokil Initial in the transaction will not be increased or decreased. Similarly, if there is an
oversubscription or undersubscription of the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued by
Rentokil Initial to Terminix stockholders due to the elections of Terminix stockholders (or failures to make an
election), the aggregate number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued by Rentokil Initial in the transaction
will not be increased or decreased. Rather, in either such case, the exchange agent will allocate between cash
and Rentokil Initial ADSs in the manner described under sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration - Cash Consideration” beginning on page 134 and “The
Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration - Stock Consideration” beginning on page 133 and as illustrated
below to ensure that the total amount of cash payable and the total number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be

valid election to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration will receive the form of
consideration elected with respect to the shares of Terminix common stock held by such stockholder. See

However, if at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Terminix stockholders, in the case of
Terminix, or at any time prior to the approval of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related matters contemplated
by the merger agreement by Rentokil Initial shareholders, in the case of Rentokil Initial, Terminix or Rentokil
Initial, as applicable, receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal made after the date of the merger
agreement which has not resulted from a violation of the solicitation restrictions described in the first
paragraph of this section (under “- No Solicitation”), the board of directors of that party is permitted to,
directly or indirectly through its representatives, and subject to certain exceptions and qualifications
described in the merger agreement:
contact the third party that has made such acquisition proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify
terms for the sole purpose of the Terminix board of directors or the Rentokil Initial board of directors,
as applicable, informing itself about such acquisition proposal and such third party; and
if the Terminix board of directors or the Rentokil Initial board of directors, as applicable, determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
acquisition proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as defined
below in this section), (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with the third party that has made
such acquisition proposal and (B) furnish to such third party and its representatives and financing
sources non-public information relating to Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as applicable, or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that
would prevent that party from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to the other party
in connection with these solicitation restrictions and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions
that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as applicable,
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement in place between Terminix and Rentokil Initial
as of the date of the merger agreement, so long as all such nonpublic information (to the extent not
previously provided or made available to the other party) is provided or made available to the other
party substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such third party.
Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as applicable, are required (1) to notify the other party as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the other party of any acquisition proposal or any
request for information relating to it or any of its subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of such party, is
reasonably likely to make or has made any acquisition proposal, (2) keep the other party reasonably
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and details (or any changes to
the type and amount of consideration) of any such acquisition proposal or request and (3) as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to the other party copies of all material

written correspondence, proposals or indications of interest relating to the terms and conditions of such
acquisition proposal or request sent or provided to Terminix or Rentokil Initial, as applicable, or any of its
subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and
conditions of any acquisition proposal).
Prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Terminix stockholders, in the case of Terminix, or at any time
prior to the approval of the Rentokil Initial transaction-related matters by Rentokil Initial shareholders, in the
case of Rentokil Initial, in response to an acquisition proposal that the Terminix board of directors or the
Rentokil Initial board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith constitutes a superior proposal, the
Terminix board of directors or the Rentokil Initial board of directors, as applicable, may, if the Terminix board
of directors or the Rentokil Initial board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable law, make an adverse recommendation
change and/or, in the case of Terminix, terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such superior proposal, but only if:
such party first notifies the other party in writing at least five business days prior to taking such
action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such
superior proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to such party)
relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the
identity of the person making such proposal);
such party makes its representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the other party and its
representatives during such five business day notice period, to the extent the other party wishes to
negotiate, to enable the other party to propose revisions to the terms of the merger agreement such
that it would cause such superior proposal to no longer constitute a superior proposal;
upon the end of such notice period, the applicable party’s board of directors considers in good
faith any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement committed to in writing by the other party,
and determines that the superior proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior
proposal; and
in the event of any change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such superior
proposal, such party, in each case, delivers to the other party an additional notice consistent with
that described in clause (A) and a new notice period under clause (A) will commence each time,
except each such notice period shall be three business days (instead of five business days), during
which time such party must comply with the foregoing requirements anew with respect to each
such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (C) above.
For purposes of this proxy statement/prospectus, “acquisition proposal” means, with respect to Terminix,
any indication of interest, proposal or offer from any person or “group” as defined in Section 13(d) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, other than Rentokil Initial and its subsidiaries, relating to any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of Terminix or any of
its subsidiaries (including securities of subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
Terminix, or to which 20% or more of the revenues or earnings of Terminix on a consolidated basis are
attributable for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are then available, (ii) direct
or indirect acquisition or issuance (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 20%
or more of the outstanding voting power of Terminix or the outstanding shares of Terminix common stock,
(iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially
owning 20% or more of the outstanding voting power of Terminix or the outstanding shares of Terminix
common stock or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction or series of related transactions

After the first effective time, Rentokil Initial agreed to, and to cause the first surviving corporation and the
surviving company to, indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, each indemnified party (as
defined below) against certain claims and for certain losses in connection with such indemnitee’s service as
a director or officer of Terminix or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to the first effective time.
The merger agreement provides that the organizational documents of the surviving company and its
subsidiaries must contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than were set forth in the organizational documents of Terminix as of the
date of the merger agreement for a period of six years after the first effective time. Such provisions may not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the first effective time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the effective time
of the transaction, were directors, officers or employees of Terminix or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable.
Further, Rentokil Initial is not permitted to settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual claim for which an indemnitee has sought indemnification, unless (i) such settlement,
compromise or consent includes a complete release of such indemnitee for all liability arising out of such
claim or (ii) such indemnitee otherwise consents.
We collectively refer to any individual who is or was previously a director or officer of Terminix or any of its
subsidiaries, or a director, trustee or officer of any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by Terminix or
any of its subsidiaries, as an indemnified party.
The merger agreement requires Rentokil Initial to cause the surviving company to maintain for a period of six
years after the first effective time, Terminix’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, or
comparable insurance provided by a reputable insurer containing terms and conditions that are at least as
favorable to the indemnified parties. However, the surviving company is not required to make annual
premium payments for such insurance in excess of 300% of the amount that Terminix paid in its last fiscal
year for such insurance. In lieu of the foregoing, Terminix, at its option (in consultation with Rentokil Initial),
may obtain prior to the first effective time a prepaid “tail” policy for a period of no more than six years that
provides coverage for the indemnified parties that is substantially equivalent to Terminix’s existing coverage
for an aggregate price not to exceed 300% of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by Terminix and
its subsidiaries for such insurance.",172,172

From the closing date through December 31 of the calendar year in which the closing date occurs (referred to
as the “Benefits Continuation Period”), the surviving company will provide to each employee who is
employed by Terminix and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the first effective time, while such employee
continues to be employed by the surviving company, Rentokil Initial or any of its subsidiaries during the
Benefits Continuation Period (each, an “Affected Employee”), employee benefits (other than retention,
change-in control, equity or other long-term incentive or other special or non-recurring compensation or
benefits, pension benefits and post-employment health and welfare benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than retention, change-in control, equity or
other long-term incentive or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits, pension benefits and
post-employment health and welfare benefits) provided to such affected employee immediately prior to the
first effective time. From the closing date through the first anniversary of the closing date, the surviving
company will provide each Affected Employee an annual rate of base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable than that provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the first effective time, and
target annual cash and long-term equity incentive opportunities that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the first effective time, and
Rentokil Initial will maintain for Affected Employees, without adverse amendment, the severance program set
forth on the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement.
With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any affected employee first becomes eligible to
participate on or after the first effective time, Rentokil Initial will (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage

Rentokil Initial transaction-related proposals, in the following circumstances:
by mutual written agreement of Rentokil Initial and Terminix;
by either Rentokil Initial or Terminix, if:
the transaction has not been completed by the end date of December 31, 2022, subject to Terminix’s
and Rentokil Initial’s respective right to unilaterally extend the end date to March 13, 2023 if, at the
time of such extension, the antitrust-related conditions are not satisfied but all other closing
conditions (other than conditions that by their terms can only be satisfied at the closing if such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied on such date and conditions with respect to the
required sales, if related definitive agreements have been executed prior to such date and the required
sales are reasonably capable of being consummated prior to March 13, 2023) have been satisfied or
waived. However, the right to terminate the merger agreement after the end date (as it may be
extended) or to extend the end date will not be available to a party if such party’s material breach of
any provision of the merger agreement is the proximate cause of the failure of the transaction to be
completed by the end date (as it may be extended);

The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information (the “Pro Forma Financial Information”),
which includes the unaudited pro forma combined statements of profit or loss for the six months ended June
30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “pro forma statements of profit or loss”) and the
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 (the “pro forma balance sheet”), has been
prepared on the basis set out in the notes below to illustrate the effect of the transaction. Completion is
subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the adoption of the merger agreement by Terminix
stockholders and other customary conditions set forth in the merger agreement. See “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Transaction” beginning on page 141 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.
The Pro Forma Financial Information gives effect to the transaction as if the transaction had taken place on
June 30, 2022 for the purposes of the pro forma balance sheet and as if the transaction had taken place on
January 1, 2021 for the purposes of the pro forma statements of profit or loss. All pro forma adjustments and
their underlying assumptions are described in the notes to the Pro Forma Financial Information.
The Pro Forma Financial Information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s financial
position or results of operations actually would have been had the Transaction been completed as of the
dates indicated. In addition, the Pro Forma Financial Information does not purport to project the future
financial position or operating results of the combined company. The pro forma adjustments are based on the
best information available at the time of the preparation of this proxy statement/prospectus and certain
assumptions that Rentokil Initial believes to be reasonable. The Pro Forma Financial Information should be
read in conjunction with:
Rentokil Initial’s consolidated financial statements and the section entitled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” beginning on pages F-6
and 249, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus;
the consolidated financial statements of Terminix and its subsidiaries (the “Terminix group”),
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the section entitled
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
contained in Terminix’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and
Terminix’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, that Terminix
previously filed with the SEC and that are incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus; and
the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/​prospectus.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Basis of presentation
The Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative and informational purposes only in
accordance with Regulation S-X Article 11, Pro Forma Financial Information (“Article 11”).
The Pro Forma Financial Information gives effect to the transaction as if the transaction had taken place on
June 30, 2022 for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and as if the transaction
had taken place on January 1, 2021 for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined statement of profit
or loss.
The pro forma balance sheet and the pro forma statement of profit or loss reflect the transaction accounting
adjustments attributable to the transaction, which depict the accounting adjustments required by IFRS. The
Pro Forma Financial Information reflects pro forma adjustments that management believes are necessary to
present fairly combined company’s pro forma results of operations and financial position following the
closing of the transaction as of and for the periods indicated. The Pro Forma Financial Information does not
reflect any adjustment for liabilities or related costs of any integration and similar activities, or benefits that
may be derived in future periods, from the transaction.
The Terminix group’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which
differs in certain respects from IFRS, and are denominated in U.S. dollars. Adjustments were made to the
Terminix group’s consolidated financial statements to convert them from Terminix’s U.S. GAAP accounting
policies to Rentokil Initial’s IFRS accounting policies after evaluating potential areas of differences at Note
2c. In addition, reclassifications have been made to align the Terminix group’s financial statement
presentation to Rentokil Initial’s financial statement presentation at Note 2b.
The Rentokil Initial group has used the following historical exchange rates to translate the Terminix group’s
financial statements and calculate certain adjustments to the Pro Forma Financial Information from U.S.
dollars to pounds sterling:
Closing exchange rate as of June 30, 2022
US$1 / £0.8212
Average exchange rate for the six months ended June 30, 2022
US$1 / £0.7702
Average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2021
US$1 / £0.7259
The estimated income tax impacts of the pre-tax adjustments that are reflected in the Pro Forma Financial
Information are calculated using an estimated blended statutory rate, which is based on preliminary
assumptions related to the jurisdictions in which the income (expense) adjustments will be recorded. The
blended statutory rate and the effective tax rate of the combined company following the transaction could be
significantly different depending on post-transaction activities and the geographical mix of the combined
company’s profits or losses before taxes.
The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, with Rentokil Initial treated as the acquirer for the accounting
purposes. The IFRS 3 acquisition method of accounting applies the fair value concepts defined in IFRS 13
and requires, among other things, that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination are recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions to this
recognition and measurement principle. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Accordingly, the Terminix group assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are adjusted based on the preliminary purchase price allocation made solely for the
purpose of preparing the unaudited pro forma combined financial information. As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Rentokil Initial has prepared preliminary estimates of fair value for all of the Terminix
group’s assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. Upon the closing, Rentokil Initial will conduct a
detailed valuation of all assets and liabilities of the Terminix group as of the date of the closing, at which
point the actual fair values will be determined as of date of the closing. Differences between these
preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur and these differences may have a
material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial information and the company’s
future results of operations and financial position. In addition, the consideration transferred is required to

be measured at the Closing Date of the transaction at the then-current market price; this particular
requirement will likely result in consideration transferred that is different from the amounts assumed in this
Pro Forma Financial Information. In identifying Rentokil Initial as the accounting acquirer, Rentokil Initial and
Terminix took into account (i) the background of the transaction, (ii) the merger agreement, (iii) the
anticipated share ownership and voting rights of the combined company, (iv) the intended corporate
governance structure of the combined company, (v) the designation of certain senior management positions,
and (vi) the relative market values, size, and profitability of the combining companies.
The Pro Forma Financial Information does not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue
enhancements that Rentokil Initial may achieve as a result of the transaction or the costs to integrate the
operations of Rentokil Initial and Terminix or the costs necessary to achieve these cost savings, operating
synergies, such as procurement, manufacturing, distribution and administrative structure efficiencies and
revenue enhancements.
All amounts are in millions of pounds sterling, except where noted otherwise.
Adjustments to the Terminix group’s financial statements
The financial information below sets out the impact of adjustments and reclassifications made to the Terminix
group’s consolidated financial statements as prepared in accordance with Terminix’s U.S. GAAP accounting
policies, in order to present them on a basis consistent with Rentokil Initial’s accounting presentation and
policies in accordance with IFRS. These adjustments reflect Rentokil Initial’s best estimates based upon the
information currently available to Rentokil Initial and could be subject to change once more detailed
information is obtained.
The Terminix group’s historical U.S. GAAP financial information has been extracted without material
adjustment from the Terminix group’s consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus.

The following adjustments have been made to convert the Terminix group’s balance sheet and
statements of operations to Rentokil Initial’s IFRS accounting policies:
Leases - Under U.S. GAAP, all of Terminix’s real estate leases were classified as operating leases,
where the lease liability is measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, and the
right-of-use (“ROU”) asset is remeasured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
incentives, prepaid/accrued rents, initial direct costs, or impairment. This treatment results in the
recognition of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under IFRS 16, depreciation
of the right-of-use asset and interest expense are recognized separately in the statement of profit or
loss. Accordingly, adjustments have been made to reflect the depreciation of right-of-use assets on
a straight-line basis and the recognition of interest expense on the lease liability under IFRS 16.
All of Terminix fleet leases were classified as finance leases under ASC 842. Adjustments have been
made to Terminix’s fleet leases to remeasure the ROU assets and liabilities at the prevailing
incremental borrowing rate (IBR). Additionally, Terminix capitalized short-term fleet leases, low
value fleet leases, and non-lease components under its ASC 842 policy. These components have
been expensed under IFRS 16 to align with Rentokil Initial’s accounting policy.
As a result, ROU assets of US$14 million and lease liabilities of US$5 million have been
derecognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 along with the related impact to deferred tax
liabilities of US$3 million and reduction of retained earnings by US$6 million. Additionally, there
was an adjustment of US$3 million to decrease operating expense and an adjustment of US$4
ii) 
was an adjustment of US$3 million to decrease operating expense and an adjustment of US$4
million to increase finance costs and a related tax benefit of US$0.3 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2022 and an adjustment of US$5 million to decrease operating expense and an
adjustment of US$8 million to increase finance costs and a related tax benefit of US$1 million during
the year ended December 31, 2021.
Share-based compensation - Under its U.S. GAAP accounting policy, Terminix has valued its
graded vesting awards with service-only conditions as a single award and has recorded the share-
based compensation expense for these awards using a straight-line method over the vesting period
for the entire award. Rentokil Initial’s IFRS accounting policies require that each tranche of a
graded vesting award with service-only conditions be valued as a separate award and that the
share-based compensation expense be recorded using a straight-line basis over the respective
vesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Adjustments have been made to
reflect the impact on the grant date fair value and the timing of expense recognition for grants with
unvested options. These changes resulted in a decrease of share-based compensation within
operating expenses of US$6 million and a related tax charge of US$1.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 and a US$2 million decrease within operating expenses and a related tax charge
of US$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This also resulted in an adjustment
between retained earnings and share premium of US$6 million and a related deferred tax benefit of
US$1 million in the balance sheet.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued)
Contingent liabilities and provisions - Under U.S. GAAP, Terminix has not discounted its
recognized contingent liabilities as the timing of the settlement of these accrued liabilities are not
fixed or readily determinable. IFRS requires provisions to be discounted if the effect of the time
value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and risks specific to the liability that have not been reflected in the best
estimate of the expenditure.
As a result, provisions of US$20 million and the related insurance receivables of US$7 million have
been reduced in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, along with a related deferred tax charge of
US$4 million, resulting from the effect of the time value of money. The statement of profit or loss for
the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a US$2 million reduction to operating expenses and a
US$3 million increase to finance costs and a related tax charge of US$0.3 million. The statement of
profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$4 million reduction to operating
expenses and a US$4 million increase to finance costs and a related tax charge of US$0.1 million.
Financial Instruments - Under its U.S. GAAP policy, Terminix capitalized financing costs associated
with its debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470. These financing costs under IFRS
standards are required to be expensed as incurred. As a result, debt financing costs capitalized in
Other Receivables -LT of US$2 million and in Bank and other long-term borrowings of US$4 million
were derecognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 along with a related deferred tax benefit
of US$2 million.
In addition, under its U.S. GAAP policy, Terminix retained the accumulated foreign currency reserve
related to a net investment hedge that was terminated during the six months ended June 30, 2022 as
the foreign entity associated with the hedge was not substantially liquidated. Under IFRS, the
foreign exchange reserve shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss upon disposal or partial
disposal of the foreign operation. As a result, a portion of the foreign exchange reserve was
released into statement of profit or loss, resulting in a $1 million increase in other reserves in the
balance sheet as of June 30, 2022.
The statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a US$1 million
reduction to operating expenses and a related tax charge of US$0.3 million for these adjustments.
The statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$2 million
reduction to operating expenses and a related tax charge of US$0.5 million.
Capitalized Software - cloud computing costs - Terminix incurred and capitalized implementation
costs related to cloud computing arrangements associated with the development of developing a
new customer service platform to replace its legacy operating systems. Under its U.S. GAAP
accounting policies, the costs incurred for the development of the platform were classified within
Prepaid Expenses on Terminix’s statement of financial position.
The costs incurred by Terminix for the development of the customer platform are not eligible for
recognition as capitalized assets under Rentokil Initial’s IFRS accounting policies and instead the
arrangement will be treated as a service agreement. Furthermore, the implementation costs are
distinct from the service agreements in place and should be expensed as incurred. Therefore, US$54
million of capitalized development costs were derecognized from the balance sheet as of June 30,
2022 along with a related deferred tax benefit of US$15 million and a retained earnings impact of
US$32 million. The statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a
US$10 million increase to operating expenses and a related tax benefit of US$3 million. The
statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$19 million increase to
operating expenses and a related tax benefit of US$6 million.
Termite damage claims - Under Terminix’s U.S. GAAP accounting policies, Terminix has recorded
certain liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings,
including litigated termite damage claims up to one year after the balance sheet date when amounts
are both probable and reasonably estimable. A provision for litigated claims is recorded as claims
are filed, while the provision for non-litigated claims is based on known filed claims plus
176

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued)
those expected to arise for active customers within the contractually stated claims notification
period. In contrast, under Rentokil Initial’s IFRS accounting policy, its assessment of probable
future cash outflows arising from claims relating to the entire pool of existing contracts is based on
historical claim trends and costs for the total estimated period a customer is expected to be
retained. This change in methodology pursuant to Rentokil Initial’s IFRS accounting policy results
in an increase in the provision for both litigated and non-litigated claims.
Accordingly, Rentokil Initial has recognised a further provision of US$250 million as of June 30,
2022, which primarily relates to non-litigated claims, with an increase to current provisions for
liabilities and charges of US$6 million and an increase to non-current provisions for liabilities and
charges of US$244 million representing Rentokil Initial’s estimate of probable claims expected to
arise over the entire duration of the customer relationship, along with a deferred tax benefit of
US$67 million. The statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a
US$42 million decrease in expense, a US$1 million increase in finance cost and a related tax charge
of US$11 million, taking account of the position as of December 31, 2021. The statement of profit or
loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a US$24 million increase in expense, and a
related tax benefit of US$6 million, taking account of the position as of December 31, 2020.
Interim Advertising Costs - Under U.S. GAAP, Terminix has elected for interim reporting to defer
advertising costs within a fiscal year where the benefits of the expenditure extend beyond the
interim period in which the expenditure was made. IFRS requires advertising and marketing costs to
be expense as incurred unless services are paid in advance and not immediately available (i.e.,
prepaid expenses). To align Terminix’s existing U.S. GAAP policy to those of Rentokil Initial, an
adjustment of US$7 million has been made to reduce prepaid expenses within trade and other
receivables on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, along with a related deferred tax charge of
US$2 million, to reflect the expense recognition of marketing services received and incurred.
The statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflects a US$7 million
increase to operating expenses and a related tax charge of US$2 million. No adjustment was
required for the year ended 31 December 2021.
Debt refinancing
On February 25, 2022, Rentokil Initial entered into a US$2,700 million credit facility consisting of (i) “Facility
A,” a bridge facility having an aggregate principal amount of US$2,000 million and (ii) “Facility B,” a term
facility having an aggregate principal amount of US$700 million (£575 million) (collectively, the Financing
Commitments), which have been provided by a syndicate of banks. Facility A had an original maturity date of
August 25, 2023. Facility B will mature on the third anniversary of the date of the first utilization.
On June 27, 2022, Rentokil Initial issued senior unsecured notes for €850 million (£732 million), €600 million
(£516 million) and £400 million (collectively, “the New Senior Notes”), maturing on June 27, 2027, June 27,
2030 and June 27, 2032, respectively. The New Senior Notes were issued in part to replace Facility A with
longer term financing with the proceeds being received and held on deposit as at June 30, 2022, pending
completion of the transaction. On June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial cancelled Facility A. Accordingly, Facility A
has been excluded from the debt refinancing adjustments below.
The proceeds of the Facility B and the New Senior Notes are to be used to pay the merger consideration,
certain costs and expenses in connection therewith and for the refinancing of indebtedness of Terminix and
its subsidiaries. On the basis that the amount can only be drawn in a single tranche, Rentokil Initial has
assumed the full amount of Facility B will be drawn down with respect to the Transaction, which is reflected
in the debt refinancing adjustments below. Upon repayment of the outstanding Terminix term loan facility,
the related interest rate swap will be terminated with a settlement of US$29 million (£24 million) expected to
be received from the counterparty based on the fair value as of June 30, 2022.

The repayment of the outstanding Terminix term loan facility and notes includes the £17 million (of the
total £65 million adjustment) adjustment recorded to debt (Note 4b(iii)), in order to increase the
historical book value to the par value to be repaid, partially offset by expected proceeds from the
settlement of interest rate swaps of US$29 million (£24 million).
The fair value adjustments to be released represents the excess of the fair value of debt recorded (Note
4b(iii)) over the par value to be repaid.
Proceeds from the credit facility are planned to be used for repayment of outstanding Terminix term loan
facility and notes, payments for cash consideration, transaction costs and other costs associated with the
Merger.
In conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding Terminix notes, a termination fee of US$58 million (£48
million) will be paid on the early settlement made by Rentokil Initial. This has been presented in the pro forma
balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents. The total cash settlement,
including the termination fee, approximates the fair value recognized on acquisition of Terminix, and therefore
a nil amount has been recorded in the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31,
2021.
The interest rate for loans borrowed pursuant to the Facility B is a benchmark rate based on the secured
overnight financing rate for U.S. dollars plus a margin determined pursuant to a ratings-based pricing grid
that ranges between 0.50% per annum and 1.00% per annum.

per €1 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Interest expense related to Facility B was converted from US$m to £m using average exchange rates for
the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 as described in Note 1

In addition to incremental interest charges, Rentokil Initial has also recorded a pro forma adjustment for
debt issuance cost amortization for each facility, which will be deferred and amortized over the duration
of the borrowings.
The related estimated net decrease to income tax expense as a result of these increased interest charges
reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Profit or Loss is £6 million and £11 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 respectively.

Preliminary purchase consideration
The total consideration expected to be transferred as of August 31, 2022 amounts to £4,480 million, and has

The estimated number of Rentokil Initial Shares is five times the number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to be
delivered because each New Rentokil Initial ADS represents five Rentokil Initial Shares.
The portion of the fair value of Terminix’s equity awards attributable to pre-combination service that will
be assumed by Rentokil Initial upon the closing amounts to £20 million, of which £6 million relates to
fully vested and outstanding awards that will be cash settled and has been included in cash
consideration. The estimated portion of the Rentokil Initial replacement award attributable to post-
combination services resulted in additional compensation expense of £5 million (see note 4h).
The total share consideration for each share of Terminix common stock was estimated using the closing
price of Rentokil Initial Plc as of August 31, 2022, and the number of fully diluted shares outstanding as
of August 31, 2022, which was the last practicable date prior to the issuance of this Pro Forma Financial
Information. The proportion of the Terminix Stock Options, Terminix Restricted Stock Unit Awards and
Terminix Performance Stock Unit Awards vesting prior to June 30, 2022, were also included within the
total share consideration. The actual purchase consideration will be determined upon the closing.
The total cash consideration was calculated using the shares of Terminix common stock outstanding as
of August 31, 2022, multiplied by the US$11 due to Terminix stockholders for each share of Terminix
common stock as set out in the merger agreement. The cash consideration also includes £6 million for
fully vested and outstanding equity awards that will be cash settled as described in note 4h.
To determine the preliminary purchase consideration of £4,480 million, Rentokil Initial’s closing share price
on August 31, 2022 of £5.21 has been used. The actual purchase price and exchange rate will fluctuate
between August 31, 2022 and the closing date of the transaction. A 10% increase in the Rentokil Initial share
price would increase the fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration and goodwill by

£337 million. A 10% decrease in the Rentokil Initial share price would decrease the preliminary purchase
consideration and goodwill by £336 million.
The preliminary purchase consideration reflected in the Pro Forma Financial Information does not purport to
represent what the actual consideration transferred will be when the transaction is completed. The fair value
of the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares underlying the Rentokil Initial ADSs to be delivered as part of the
consideration transferred will be measured, at the closing, based on the number of Terminix shares
outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio of 1.0619 and the then-current market price of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares. This requirement will likely result in a per share equity component different from the £5.21
per share closing price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on August 31, 2022 that is assumed in the Pro
Forma Financial Information, and that difference may be material.
Preliminary purchase consideration allocation
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the preliminary purchase consideration is allocated to the
Terminix group’s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The preliminary allocation
included in the Pro Forma Financial Information below has been developed based on preliminary estimates of
fair value using the historical financial statements of the Terminix group as of June 30, 2022 and is therefore
subject to change.
The preliminary allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of August 31, 2022 is

Except as discussed below, the carrying value of Terminix’s assets and liabilities are considered to

The fair value of Terminix’s intangible assets is estimated to be £1,752 million, or a net increase of
£875 million compared to a carrying value of £877 million. The primary intangible assets include
trade names and customer relationships, for which the fair value estimates of identifiable intangible
assets have been determined using the income approach. The assumptions used by Rentokil Initial
to arrive at the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets have been derived primarily
from public information and information provided by Rentokil Initial and Terminix.

Based on the estimated respective fair values of identified intangible assets and the weighted average
estimated useful lives, an adjustment to amortization expense of £27 million and £54 million has been
included in the pro forma statements of profit and loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the year
ended December 31, 2021 respectively, being the amortization charge above less £15 million and £29 million
of historical amortization expensed in the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31,
2021 respectively. The related estimated net decrease to income tax expense for the pro forma statement of
profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 is £7 million, which comprises the total transaction
adjustment to income tax expense. The related estimated net decrease to income tax expense for the pro forma
statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 is £15 million, which is included in the total
adjustment to income tax expense of £20 million along with the tax effect of the replacement awards of £1
million in note 4h and the tax effect of the management compensation arrangements of £4 million in note 4i.
This adjustment will recur for the life of the underlying assets.
The goodwill balance arising from the acquisition is estimated to be £3,810 million, which
represents an uplift of £2,080 million. The goodwill has been calculated as excess of the purchase
consideration of £4,480 million over the fair value of the net assets acquired of £670 million.
The fair value of Terminix’s total debt is estimated to be £886 million, or a net increase of £65 million
compared to book value of £821 million. The change in the debt balance is as a result of the fair
value increases associated with Terminix’s listed bonds that will be acquired as part of the
transaction.
The fair value increase in contingent liabilities relating to future termite warranty claims for
received claims and probable claims within one year on the balance sheet at June 30, 2022 is £6
million. This amount has been included in current provisions and other charges.
The change in the deferred tax liability is as a result of the above fair value adjustments. The
estimated net deferred tax liability is £472 million, which represents an adjustment of £217 million.
This adjustment comprises £236 million in relation to the fair value uplift on intangible assets,
offset by a £19 million deferred tax asset in relation to the fair value uplift on contingent liabilities

and long-term debt. The estimated net deferred tax liability is based on assumptions and limited
information and therefore the final amounts may differ materially from these estimates.

It has been estimated that total transaction and related costs of £116 million will be incurred collectively by
Rentokil Initial and Terminix in connection with the transaction, which include advisory, legal, valuation and
other professional fees of which £27 million and £11 million was incurred in the six months ended June 30,
2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Incurred transaction and related costs of £27
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 are attributable as follows: Rentokil Initial £19 million and
Terminix £8 million. As a result, an adjustment of £27 million was made to decrease operating expenses in the
six months ended June 30, 2022 and to record these costs in the year ended December 31, 2021 in the pro
forma statement of profit or loss. Incurred transaction and related costs of £11 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 are attributable as follows: Rentokil Initial £6 million and Terminix £5 million. £23 million of
Rentokil Initial transaction costs are considered as incremental costs directly attributable to the share
issuance, of which £13 million has been capitalized to share premium in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022.
As a result, an adjustment has been made to capitalize a further £10 million in the pro forma balance sheet as
of June 30, 2022. Furthermore, an adjustment of £83 million for the remaining transaction costs has been
presented in the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the year-ended December 31, 2021 within operating
expenses. These one-off costs will not have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company.
Total estimated transaction and related costs in conjunction with the transaction of £116 million are
attributable as follows: Rentokil Initial £80 million and Terminix £36 million. As of June 30, 2022, Rentokil
Initial had charged £25 million cumulatively to the statements of profit and loss and £13 million capitalized to
share premium and therefore an adjustment of £42 million has been presented in the pro forma balance sheet
as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents and a corresponding reduction to retained earnings of £32
million and share premium of £10 million to represent the estimated future charge (Note 4e). Terminix had
charged £13 million cumulatively to the statements of profit and loss and therefore an adjustment of £23
million has been presented in the pro forma balance sheet as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents and a
corresponding increase to goodwill as these transaction costs will reduce Terminix’s retained earnings prior
to the consummation of the transaction.
These amounts have not been tax effected as the tax deductibility of these items has not been determined.

Adjustments to operating expense
The total transaction adjustment to operating expenses in the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 of nil includes the £27 million adjustment to reduce transaction and related costs
recorded offset by adjustments to record amortization expense of £27 million (Note 4b(i)).
The total transaction adjustment to operating expenses in the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the
year ended December 31, 2021 of £154 million includes the £82 million adjustment for transaction and related
costs as well as adjustments to amortization expense of £54 million (Note 4b(i)), replacement awards of £5
million (Note 4h), and Terminix management compensation of £13 million (Note 4i).

Total estimated transaction and related costs is £116 million (Note 4c) comprising of £23 million of
incremental costs directly attributable to the share issuance that will be capitalized to share premium and £93
million of costs that will be expensed. As of June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial had £25 million of transaction and
related costs included in retained earnings and £13 million capitalized to share premium while Terminix had
£13 million included in retained earnings. As a result, within shareholders’ equity, an adjustment of £32
million has been made to retained earnings and an adjustment has been made to capitalize a further £10
million to share premium relating to Rentokil Initial’s costs, and an adjustment of £23 million has been made
to goodwill for Terminix’s costs (Note 4c).
Income tax impact
The estimated income tax impacts of the pre-tax adjustments that are reflected in the Pro Forma Financial
Information are calculated using an estimated blended statutory rate of 27%, which is based on preliminary
assumptions related to the jurisdictions in which the income (expense) adjustments will be recorded. The
blended statutory rate of the combined company following the Transaction could be significantly different
depending on post-Transaction activities and the geographical mix of profit or loss before taxes.
Earnings per share
Pro forma earnings (loss) per share (referred to as “EPS”) for the pro forma statement of profit or loss have
been recalculated to show the impacts of the transaction after giving effect to the Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares to be issued to Terminix stockholders, on a constant diluted and basic outstanding share basis,
assuming that the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares underlying the Rentokil Initial ADSs to be issued in
connection with the transaction were outstanding at the beginning of the periods presented. The effect of
anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares is ignored in calculating pro forma diluted earnings (loss) per share.

Terminix stock options
At the first effective time, each Terminix Stock Option that is then vested and exercisable will be cancelled in
consideration for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding
taxes, equal to the product of the excess of the Vested Award Consideration over the exercise price per share
of the respective Terminix Stock Option and the number of shares of Terminix common stock subject to such
Terminix Stock Option immediately prior to the first effective time.
At the first effective time, each Terminix Stock Option that is then unvested will be converted into an
Assumed Option to purchase a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the number of shares of Terminix
common stock underlying the Terminix Stock Option multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. The
exercise price per Rentokil Initial ADS applicable to each Assumed Option will be equal to the exercise price
per share of Terminix common stock applicable to such Terminix Stock Option divided by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed Option will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix Stock Option.
Terminix restricted stock unit awards
At the first effective time, each Terminix RSU Award that is vested will be cancelled in consideration for the
right to receive, in respect of each share of Terminix common stock subject to such Terminix RSU Award
immediately prior to the first effective time, the Vested Award Consideration, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes.
At the first effective time, each other Terminix RSU Award will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and will be
converted into an Assumed RSU Award that settles in a number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the number
of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix RSU Award multiplied by the Equity

Award Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed RSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix RSU Award.
Terminix performance stock unit awards
At the first effective time, each outstanding Terminix PSU Award that was granted prior to the date of the
merger agreement will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and converted into an Assumed PSU Award that settles,
subject to the achievement of the applicable time-based vesting conditions, in a number of Rentokil Initial
ADSs equal to the product of the number of shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix PSU
Award (determined by deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of the target
level and the actual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior to the first effective time),
multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Each such Assumed PSU Award will continue to have, and
will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix PSU Award, other
than any performance-based vested conditions.
At the first effective time, each Terminix PSU Award granted after the date of the merger agreement (under
circumstances permitted by the merger agreement) will be assumed by Rentokil Initial and converted into an
Assumed PSU Award that settles, subject to the achievement of the applicable time and performance-based
vesting conditions, in a target number of Rentokil Initial ADSs equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Terminix common stock underlying the Terminix PSU Award (determined by assuming the
applicable performance goals to be achieved at target level) multiplied by (2) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio. Each such Assumed PSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Terminix PSU Award, except that the applicable performance
metrics will be adjusted in good faith by Terminix and Rentokil Initial to provide for performance metrics that
are based on the combined businesses.
Terminix director deferred share equivalents
At the first effective time, each outstanding director deferred share equivalent award with respect to shares
of Terminix common stock will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive the Vested Award
Consideration, without interest.
Adjustment
The portion of the awards that has been included as part of the purchase consideration in note 4a has been
determined by multiplying the fair value of the award as of June 30, 2022, by the portion of the requisite
service period that elapsed prior to the transaction divided by the total service period. As reflected in note
4a, the portion of the fair value of Terminix’s equity awards attributable to pre-combination service that will
be assumed by Rentokil Initial upon the closing amounts to £20 million, of which £6 million relates to fully
vested and outstanding awards that will be settled in cash and £14 million relates to newly issued Rentokil
Initial awards.
The estimated portion of the award attributable to post-combination services resulted in additional
compensation expense of £5 million in the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the year ended December
31, 2021 and a corresponding adjustment to share premium. There was no additional compensation expense
or related income tax expense to be adjusted for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The related estimated
net decrease to income tax expense for the pro forma statement of profit or loss for the year ended December
31, 2021 is £1 million, which is included in the total adjustment to income tax expense of £20 million, along
with the tax effect of the increase in amortization expense of £15 million in note 4b(i) and the tax effect of the
management compensation arrangements of £4 million in note 4i. This adjustment will not have a continuing
impact on the combined company once the post-combination service period has elapsed.
Terminix management compensation arrangements
Terminix has management agreements in place with its executive officers. The agreements contain clauses
which stipulate that named executive officers will be entitled to receive certain payments and

benefits if they experience a qualifying termination of employment subsequent to the completion of the
transaction and, in certain cases, after a specified period of time. For the Terminix named executive officers,
the aggregate cash payments would be £9 million, the accelerated equity payments would be £10 million, and
the value of other benefits would be £4 million. The effects of the aggregate cash payments and other
benefits of £13 million resulting from the Terminix management agreements have been reflected within
operating expenses for the year end December 31, 2021 as part of the total transaction adjustments of £154
million, with a corresponding tax impact of £4 million, which is included in the total adjustment to income tax
expense of £20 million along with the tax effect of the increase in amortization expense of £15 million in note
4b(i) and the tax effect of the replacement awards of £1 million in note 4h. These one-off costs will not have a
continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The costs have been shown as a reduction to
cash and cash equivalents in the pro forma balance sheet. The effect of the equity component of these
arrangements has been included in the adjustment at note 4h.

management agreements, Rentokil Initial would be required to make the following payments in total:

Disposal of the UK and Norway businesses
On June 1, 2022, in order to satisfy closing conditions of the proposed acquisition by Rentokil Initial,
Terminix divested its international pest management businesses in the UK and Norway (the “Divestment”).
The pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 excludes the balances of the UK and Norway business
following the Divestment but the pro forma profit or loss statement includes the financial results of these
businesses up to the date of the Divestment and were not excluded on the basis of materiality. Terminix
recorded a loss on the sale of these international subsidiaries of US$41 million in the six-month period
ending June 30, 2022. Together, the two businesses generated revenue of US$21 million (£16 million) and
US$53 million (£38 million) which was included in statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June
30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021 respectively.

The following table sets forth information as of August 15, 2022 with respect to the ownership of Terminix
common stock by:
each person known to own beneficially more than five percent of Terminix common stock;
each of the Terminix directors;
each Terminix named executive officer; and
all of the Terminix current executive officers and directors as a group.
The amounts and percentages of shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the
SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed
to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power, which
includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be
a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within
60 days. Securities that can be so acquired are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing such
person’s ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any other person’s percentage. Under
these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a
person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic
interest.
Percentage computations are based on 121,551,150 shares of Terminix common stock outstanding as of
August 15, 2022.
Except as otherwise indicated in these footnotes, each of the beneficial owners listed has, to Terminix’s
knowledge, sole voting and investment power with respect to the indicated shares of common stock.

meetings of Rentokil Initial. Rentokil Initial may issue, subject to the restrictions discussed above under the
caption “- Further Issuances of Share Capital and Pre-emptive Rights” beginning on page 193 of this proxy
statement/prospectus, shares with preferential voting rights. This section assumes that all shares have equal
voting rights and that no preferential shares are issued.
Under English law, resolutions to be voted on by shareholders at a general meeting can be either an ordinary
resolution, which means that the resolution must be passed by a simple majority of shareholders or holders
of a simple majority of the shares (depending on whether the vote is by a show of hands or by a poll) present
in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the general meeting, or a special resolution, which means that
the resolution must be passed by a majority of not less than 75% of the shareholders or holders of 75% of
the shares (depending on whether the vote is by a show of hands or by a poll) present in person or by proxy
and entitled to vote at the general meeting. For a resolution to be regarded as a special resolution, the notice
of the general meeting must specify the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution.
A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting held partly by means of electronic facility or facilities shall,
unless the chairman of the meeting determines that it shall be decided on a show of hands, be decided on a
poll. Subject thereto, a resolution put to the vote at a general meeting shall be decided on a show of hands
unless before, or on the declaration of the result of, a vote on the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of
any other demand for a poll, a poll is duly demanded by:
the chairman of the meeting;
not less than five shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting;
a shareholder or shareholders representing not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all the
shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting (excluding any voting rights attached to any
shares in Rentokil Initial held as treasury shares); or
a shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which an
aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the

shares conferring that right (excluding any shares in Rentokil Initial conferring a right to vote at the
meeting which are held as treasury shares).
On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person has one vote regardless of the number of
shares held by such shareholder. Every proxy duly appointed by a shareholder entitled to vote on the
resolution and present has one vote.
On a poll every shareholder present in person or by duly appointed proxy or corporate representative has
one vote for every share held by the shareholder. A shareholder, proxy or corporate representative entitled to
more than one vote need not, if he or she votes, use all his or her votes or cast all the votes he or she uses
the same way.
For the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a general meeting, Rentokil
Initial may specify in the notice convening the meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before the time fixed
for the meeting, by which a person must be entered on the register in order to have the right to attend or
vote at the meeting.
In the case of joint holders, the most senior of the joint holders who tenders a vote shall be accepted to the
exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the
names of the holders stand in the register of shareholders.
No shareholder will be permitted to vote at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of any
class of shares in Rentokil Initial, either personally or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all
amounts presently payable by such holder in respect of that share have been paid.

UK residents or foreign shareholders to own Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, including the rights to hold or
exercise voting rights on the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.",209,210

TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Change of Control and Takeovers,"Change of Control and Takeovers
Rentokil Initial is subject to the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which governs the conduct of mergers
and takeovers in the UK.
An English public limited company such as Rentokil Initial may be acquired in a number of ways, including
by means of a scheme of arrangement (as defined below) between the company and its shareholders or by
means of a takeover offer.
A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure under the UK Companies Act 2006 pursuant to which the
English courts may approve an arrangement between an English company and some or all of its
shareholders. In a scheme of arrangement, the company would make an initial application to the court to
convene a meeting or meetings of its shareholders at which a majority in number of shareholders
representing 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders present and voting either in person or by proxy at
the meeting must agree to the arrangement by which they will sell their shares in exchange for the
consideration being offered by the bidder. If the shareholders so agree, the company will return to court to
request the court to sanction the arrangement. Upon such a scheme of arrangement becoming effective in
accordance with its terms and the UK Companies Act 2006, it will bind the company and such shareholders.
A takeover offer is an offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of a company (other than shares which at
the date of the offer are already held by the bidder). Under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers and in
order to squeeze out dissenting shareholders, the offer must be made on identical terms to all holders of
shares to which the offer relates. If the bidder, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquires or contracts to
acquire not less than 90% in value of the shares to which the offer relates representing not less than 90% of
the voting rights attached to the shares, the UK Companies Act 2006 allows the bidder to give notice to any
non-accepting shareholder that the bidder intends to acquire his, her or its shares through a compulsory
acquisition (also referred to as a squeeze-out), and the shares of such non-accepting shareholders will be
acquired by the bidder six weeks later on the same terms as the offer, unless the shareholder objects to the
English court and the court enters an order that the bidder is not entitled to acquire the shares or specifying
terms of the acquisition different to those of the offer.
The UK Companies Act 2006 permits a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer to be made relating only to a
particular class or classes of a company’s shares.
As Rentokil Initial is a UK premium listed company, if it were subject to a takeover bid and the takeover were
structured as a contractual takeover offer, under the FCA’s Listing Rules a bidder would have to, by virtue of
its shareholdings and acceptances of its takeover offer, acquire or agree to acquire shares carrying 75% of
the voting rights of Rentokil Initial before it could cancel Rentokil Initial’s listing on the main market of the
LSE.
Where the takeover is by way of a scheme of arrangement, the FCA’s Listing Rules do not impose any
additional rules as regards shareholder approval or the level of acceptances required before Rentokil Initial
could be delisted, as the scheme procedure provides sufficient protection for shareholders.
There are no provisions in Rentokil Initial’s articles of association that would have an effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a takeover by, or change of control of, Rentokil Initial.
198 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Under English law, Rentokil Initial’s directors have a statutory and fiduciary duty to take only those actions
that are in the interests of Rentokil Initial as a whole. Generally, anti-takeover measures are not actions that
fall within this category.
However, under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, if an acquisition of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares
increases the aggregate holding of an acquirer and persons acting in concert with the acquirer (i.e., persons

Initial ordinary shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months. This requirement
would also be triggered by any acquisition of shares by a person holding (together with its concert parties)
shares carrying between 30% and 50% of the voting rights in Rentokil Initial if the effect of such acquisition
were to increase that person’s percentage of the voting rights.",212,213

An annual general meeting of shareholders must be held every year within a period of six months of the day
following Rentokil Initial’s financial year end (which is December 31), at such times and places as may be
determined by the directors.
Ability to Call General Meetings
The directors may call general meetings. If there are not sufficient directors to form a quorum in order to call
a general meeting, any director may call a general meeting. If there is no director willing or able to do so, any
two shareholders of Rentokil Initial may call a general meeting for the purpose of appointing one or more
directors.
The directors are required to call a general meeting if requested by shareholders representing at least 5% of
the paid-up capital of Rentokil Initial as carries the right of voting at general meetings (excluding any paid-up
capital held as treasury shares). Such meeting must be called within 21 days from the date on which the
directors become subject to the requirement, and held on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the
notice calling the meeting. A meeting called upon the request of shareholders may only deal with the
business stated in the request by shareholders, or as proposed by the directors. If the directors fail to call
the general meeting requested by the shareholders, the shareholders who requested the meeting, or any of
them representing more than one half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a general
meeting. Such meeting must be called for a date not more than three months after the date on which the
directors become subject to the requirement to call a meeting. Any reasonable expenses incurred by the
shareholders requesting the meeting by reason of the failure of the directors duly to call a meeting must be
reimbursed by Rentokil Initial.
Notice of General Meetings
Pursuant to the UK Companies Act, an annual general meeting and all other general meetings of Rentokil
Initial must be called by at least 21 clear days’ written notice (the “clear days” rule is set out in section 360 of
the UK Companies Act 2006 and excludes the day of the meeting and the day that the notice is given).
However, the UK Companies Act 2006 allows for this period of notice for meetings other than annual general
meetings to be reduced to 14 clear days’ notice provided that: (i) the company allows its shareholders to
make proxy appointments via a website (such as one hosted by its share registrars); and (ii) shareholders
must pass a special resolution at the annual general meeting every year approving the shortening of the
notice period to 14 days.
A special resolution enabling Rentokil Initial to hold general meetings (other than annual general meetings)
on 14 clear days’ notice was approved at Rentokil Initial’s annual general meeting held on May 11, 2022.
The notice shall specify the time, date and place of such general meeting, the means, or all different means,
of attendance and participation (including, without limitation, any satellite meeting places the
199 •

TABLE OF CONTENTS
directors have determined be used to enable attendance and participation) and the general nature of the
business to be dealt with. Subject to the provisions of the UK Companies Acts, the articles of association of
Rentokil Initial, and to any restrictions imposed on any shares, the notice shall be sent to every shareholder
and every director. The auditors are entitled to receive all notices of, and other communications relating to,
any general meeting which any shareholder is entitled to receive.
Any notice to be given to a shareholder may be given by reference to those persons entered on the register
at the close of business on a day determined by Rentokil Initial or the directors, which day may not be more
than 21 days before the day that notices of the meeting are sent.
A shareholder whose registered address is not within an EEA State and who sends to Rentokil Initial an
address within an EEA State at which a document or information may be sent to him shall be entitled to have
the document or information sent to him at that address (provided that, in the case of a document or
information sent by electronic means including without limitation any notification required by the UK
Companies Acts that the document or information is available on a website, Rentokil Initial so agrees, which
agreement Rentokil Initial shall be entitled to withhold in its absolute discretion including, without limitation,
in circumstances in which Rentokil Initial considers that the sending of the document or information to such
address using electronic means would or might infringe the laws of any other jurisdiction) but otherwise:
no such shareholder shall be entitled to receive any document or information from Rentokil Initial;
and
any notice of a general meeting of Rentokil Initial which is in fact sent or purports to be sent to such
shareholder shall be ignored for the purpose of determining the validity of the proceedings at such
general meeting.
If at any time Rentokil Initial is unable effectively to convene a general meeting by notices sent through the
post in the United Kingdom as a result of the suspension or curtailment of postal services, notice of a
general meeting may be sufficiently given by advertisement in the United Kingdom. Any notice given by
advertisement shall be advertised in at least one newspaper having a national circulation. If advertised in
more than one newspaper, the advertisements shall appear on the same date. Such notice shall be deemed to
have been sent to all persons who are entitled to have notice of meetings sent to them on the day when the
advertisement appears. In any such case, Rentokil Initial shall send confirmatory copies of the notice by
post, if at least seven days before the meeting the posting of notices to addresses throughout the United
Kingdom again becomes practicable.
Quorum
No business other than the appointment of a chairman shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a
quorum is present. Two persons entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted, each being a
shareholder or a proxy for a shareholder or a duly authorized representative of a corporation which is a
shareholder, shall be a quorum.
Attendance at General Meetings
All shareholders may attend, speak and vote at Rentokil Initial general meetings (including annual general
meetings). A shareholder is entitled to appoint another person as his, her or its proxy. A proxy appointment
shall be deemed to entitle the proxy to exercise all or any of the appointing shareholder’s rights to attend and
to speak and vote at a meeting of Rentokil Initial. A proxy appointment shall be deemed also to confer
authority to demand or join in demanding a poll. The proxy appointment shall, unless it provides to the
contrary, be valid for any adjournment of the meeting as well as for the meeting to which it relates. The
appointment of a proxy shall not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting
or poll concerned. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy to attend on the same occasion, provided
that each such proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that
shareholder. An appointment of proxy shall be in writing in any usual form or in any other form which the
directors may approve. Subject thereto, the appointment of proxy may be: (i) in hard copy form; or (ii) in
electronic form, if Rentokil Initial agrees. The appointment of proxy shall be executed in such manner as may
be approved by or on behalf of Rentokil Initial from time to time. Subject thereto, the
200 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
appointment of a proxy shall be executed by the appointer or any person duly authorized by the appointer or,
if the appointer is a corporation, executed by a duly authorized person or under its common seal or in any
other manner authorized by its constitution.
Any corporation which is a shareholder of Rentokil Initial may, by resolution of its directors or other
governing body, authorize such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of Rentokil
Initial or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares. A person so authorized shall be
entitled to exercise the same power on behalf of the grantor as the grantor could exercise if it were an
individual shareholder of Rentokil Initial. A director, the secretary or other person authorized for the purpose
by the secretary may require such person to produce a certified copy of the resolution of authorization
before permitting him, her or it to exercise his, her or its powers.
The directors and the chairman may make any arrangement and impose any requirement or restriction it or he
considers appropriate to ensure the security of a general meeting held at a physical place, including, without
limitation, requirements for evidence of identity to be produced by those attending the meeting, the
searching of their personal property and the restriction of items that may be taken into the meeting place.
The directors and the chairman are entitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply with these
arrangements, requirements or restrictions.
The directors shall determine in relation to each general meeting the means of attendance at and participation
in the meeting, including whether the persons entitled to attend and participate in the general meeting shall
be enabled to do so by, in addition to simultaneous attendance and participation at a physical place (or
places, by way of satellite meetings) anywhere in the world determined by it, by means of electronic facility

The depositary bank will register and deliver Rentokil Initial ADSs. Each Rentokil Initial ADS will represent
five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (or a right to receive five Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) deposited with
the custodian. Each Rentokil Initial ADS will also represent any other securities, cash or other property that
may be held by the depositary bank. The deposited Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, together with any other
securities, cash or other property held by the depositary bank are referred to as the “deposited securities.”
The depositary bank’s office at which the Rentokil Initial ADSs will be administered and its principal
executive office are located at 240 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10286.
You may hold Rentokil Initial ADSs either (A) directly (i) by having an American depositary receipt (“ADR”),
which is a certificate evidencing a specific number of Rentokil Initial ADSs, registered in your name, or (ii) by
having uncertificated Rentokil Initial ADSs registered in your name, or (B) indirectly by holding a security
entitlement in Rentokil Initial ADSs through your broker or other financial institution that is a direct or
indirect participant in DTC. If you hold Rentokil Initial ADSs directly, you are a registered Rentokil Initial
ADS holder (a “Rentokil Initial ADS Holder”). This description assumes you are a Rentokil Initial ADS
Holder. If you hold the Rentokil Initial ADSs indirectly, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or
other financial institution to assert the rights of Rentokil Initial ADS Holders described in this section. You
should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are.
Registered holders of uncertificated Rentokil Initial ADSs will receive statements from the depositary bank
confirming their holdings.
As a Rentokil Initial ADS Holder, Rentokil Initial will not treat you as one of Rentokil Initial’s shareholders
and you will not have shareholder rights. English law governs the shareholder rights of holders of Rentokil
Initial shares. The depositary bank will be the holder of the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares underlying your
Rentokil Initial ADSs. As a registered holder of Rentokil Initial ADSs, you will have Rentokil Initial ADS
Holder rights. A deposit agreement among Rentokil Initial, the depositary bank, Rentokil Initial ADS Holders
and all other persons indirectly or beneficially holding Rentokil Initial ADSs sets out Rentokil Initial ADS
Holder rights as well as the rights and obligations of the depositary bank. New York law governs the deposit
agreement and the Rentokil Initial ADSs.
The following is a summary of the material provisions of the deposit agreement. For more complete
information, you should read the entire deposit agreement and the form of ADR. See “Where You Can Find
Additional Information” elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus for directions on how to obtain
copies of those documents.",216,216
TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Dividends and Other Distributions,"Dividends and Other Distributions
The depositary bank has agreed to pay or distribute to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders the cash dividends or
other distributions it or the custodian receives on Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or other deposited
securities, upon payment or deduction of its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in
proportion to the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares your Rentokil Initial ADSs represent.
Cash. The depositary bank will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution Rentokil Initial pays on
the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares into U.S. dollars, if it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the
U.S. dollars to the United States. If that is not possible or if any government approval is needed and cannot
be obtained, the deposit agreement allows the depositary bank to distribute the foreign currency only to
those Rentokil Initial ADS Holders to whom it is possible to do so. It will hold the foreign currency it cannot
convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid. It will not invest the foreign currency
and it will not be liable for any interest.
Before making a distribution, any withholding taxes or other governmental charges that must be paid will be
deducted. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” and “Material UK Tax Consequences of
Owning Rentokil Initial Ordinary Shares or Rentokil Initial ADSs.” The depositary will distribute only
202 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round fractional cents to the nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates
fluctuate during a time when the depositary bank cannot convert the foreign currency, you may lose some
of the value of the distribution.
Ordinary Shares. The depositary bank may, and, if Rentokil Initial so requests in writing, shall, distribute
additional Rentokil Initial ADSs representing any Rentokil Initial ordinary shares distributed as a dividend or
free distribution. The depositary bank will only distribute whole Rentokil Initial ADSs. It will sell Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares, which would require it to deliver a fraction of a Rentokil Initial ADS (or Rentokil Initial
ADSs representing those Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as
it does with cash. If the depositary bank does not distribute additional Rentokil Initial ADSs, the outstanding
Rentokil Initial ADSs will also represent the new Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. The depositary bank may
sell a portion of the distributed Rentokil Initial ordinary shares (or Rentokil Initial ADSs representing those
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares) sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution
and to pay any tax or other governmental charge to which such distribution is subject.
Rights to purchase additional Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. If Rentokil Initial offers holders of its securities
any rights to subscribe for additional Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or any other rights, the depositary bank
shall, to the extent lawful and practical (i) exercise those rights on behalf of Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, (ii)
distribute those rights to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders or (iii) sell those rights and distribute the net proceeds
to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, in each case after deduction or upon payment of its fees and expenses. To
the extent the depositary bank does not do any of those things, it will allow the rights to lapse. In that case,
you will receive no value for them. The depositary bank will exercise or distribute rights only if Rentokil
Initial asks it to and Rentokil Initial and the Depositary enter into a separate agreement setting forth the
conditions and procedures of the offering. If the depositary bank will exercise rights, it will purchase the
securities to which the rights relate and distribute those securities or, in the case of Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares, new Rentokil Initial ADSs representing the new Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, to subscribing
Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, but only if Rentokil Initial ADS Holders have paid the exercise price to the
depositary bank. U.S. securities laws may restrict the ability of the depositary bank to distribute rights or
Rentokil Initial ADSs or other securities issued on exercise of rights to all or certain Rentokil Initial ADS
Holders, and the securities distributed may be subject to restrictions on transfer. The depositary bank may
sell a portion of the rights to subscribe for additional Rentokil Initial ordinary shares sufficient to pay any tax
or other governmental charge to which such distribution is subject.
Other Distributions. The depositary bank will send to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders anything else Rentokil
Initial distributes on deposited securities by any means it thinks is legal, fair and practical. If it cannot make
the distribution in that way, the depositary bank has a choice. It may decide to sell what Rentokil Initial
distributed and distribute the net proceeds, in the same way as it does with cash. Or, it may decide to hold
what Rentokil Initial distributed, in which case Rentokil Initial ADSs will also represent the newly distributed
property. However, the depositary bank is not required to distribute any securities (other than Rentokil Initial
ADSs) to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders unless it receives satisfactory assurances from Rentokil Initial that it
is legal to make that distribution. The depositary bank may sell a portion of the distributed securities or
property sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution and to pay any tax or
other governmental charge to which such distribution is subject. U.S. securities laws may restrict the ability
of the depositary bank to distribute securities to all or certain Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, and the securities
distributed may be subject to restrictions on transfer.
The depositary bank is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution
available to any Rentokil Initial ADS Holders. Rentokil Initial has no obligation to register Rentokil Initial
ADSs, Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, rights or other securities under the U.S. Securities Act. Rentokil Initial
also has no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of Rentokil Initial ADSs, Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares, rights or anything else to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders. This means that you may not
receive the distributions Rentokil Initial makes on Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or any value for them if
it is illegal or impractical for it to make them available to you.",216,217

deposit.
You may surrender your Rentokil Initial ADSs to the depositary bank for the purpose of withdrawal. Upon

fees, the depositary bank will deliver Rentokil Initial ordinary shares and any other deposited securities
underlying the Rentokil Initial ADSs to the Rentokil Initial ADS Holder or a person the Rentokil Initial ADS
Holder designates at the office of the custodian. Or, at your request, risk and expense, the depositary bank
will deliver the deposited securities at its office, if feasible. However, the depositary bank is not required to
accept surrender of Rentokil Initial ADSs to the extent it would require delivery of a fraction of a deposited
share or other security. The depositary bank may charge you a fee and its expenses for instructing the
custodian regarding delivery of deposited securities.
You may surrender your ADRs to the depositary bank for the purpose of exchanging your ADRs for
uncertificated Rentokil Initial ADSs. The depositary bank will cancel that ADR and will send to the Rentokil
Initial ADS Holder a statement confirming that the Rentokil Initial ADS Holder is the registered holder of
uncertificated Rentokil Initial ADSs. Upon receipt by the depositary bank of a proper instruction from a
registered holder of uncertificated Rentokil Initial ADSs requesting the exchange of uncertificated Rentokil
Initial ADSs for certificated Rentokil Initial ADSs, the depositary bank will execute and deliver to the Rentokil

Rentokil Initial ADS Holders may instruct the depositary bank how to vote the number of deposited shares
their Rentokil Initial ADSs represent. After Rentokil Initial requests the depositary bank to solicit your voting
instructions, the depositary bank will notify you of a shareholders’ meeting and send or make voting
materials available to you. Those materials will describe the matters to be voted on and explain how Rentokil
Initial ADS Holders may instruct the depositary bank how to vote. For instructions to be valid, they must
reach the depositary bank by a date set by the depositary bank. The depositary bank will try, as far as
practical, subject to the laws of England and Wales and the provisions of Rentokil Initial’s articles of
association or similar documents, to vote or to have its agents vote the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or
other deposited securities as instructed by Rentokil Initial ADS Holders.
Except by instructing the depositary bank as described above, you won’t be able to exercise voting rights
unless you surrender your Rentokil Initial ADSs and withdraw the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.
However, you may not know about the meeting enough in advance to withdraw the Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares. In any event, the depositary bank will not exercise any discretion in voting deposited
securities and it will only vote or attempt to vote as instructed.
Rentokil Initial cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can
instruct the depositary bank to vote your Rentokil Initial ordinary shares. In addition, the depositary bank
and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying
out voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise voting rights and there may be
nothing you can do if your Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are not voted as you requested.
In order to give you a reasonable opportunity to instruct the depositary bank as to the exercise of voting
rights relating to deposited securities, if Rentokil Initial requests the depositary bank to act, Rentokil Initial
agrees to give the depositary bank notice of any such meeting and details concerning the matters to be
voted upon at least 40 days in advance of the meeting, or, in the case of any meeting that is not an annual
general meeting, a number of days agreed in writing between Rentokil Initial and the depositary bank that
shall not be less than 20 days, before the meeting date.

As necessary
The depositary bank collects its fees for delivery and surrender of Rentokil Initial ADSs directly from parties
depositing Rentokil Initial ordinary shares or surrendering Rentokil Initial ADSs for the purpose of
withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary bank collects fees for making distributions
to holders of Rentokil Initial ADSs by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a
portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary bank may collect its annual fee for
depositary bank services by deduction from cash distributions or by directly billing holders of Rentokil
Initial ADSs or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them. The depositary
bank may collect any of its fees by deduction from any cash distribution payable (or by selling a portion of
securities or other property distributable) to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders that are obligated to pay those
fees. The depositary bank may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those
services are paid.
From time to time, the depositary bank may make payments to Rentokil Initial to reimburse it for costs and
expenses generally arising out of establishment and maintenance of the Rentokil Initial ADS program, waive
fees and expenses for services provided to Rentokil Initial by the depositary bank or share revenue from the
fees collected from Rentokil Initial ADS Holders. In performing its duties under the deposit

agreement, the depositary bank may use brokers, dealers, foreign currency dealers or other service providers
that are owned by or affiliated with the depositary bank and that may earn or share fees, spreads or
commissions.
The depositary bank may convert currency itself or through any of its affiliates, or the custodian or Rentokil
Initial may convert currency and pay U.S. dollars to the depositary bank. Where the depositary bank
converts currency itself or through any of its affiliates, the depositary bank acts as principal for its own
account and not as agent, advisor, broker or fiduciary on behalf of any other person and earns revenue,
including, without limitation, transaction spreads, that it will retain for its own account. The revenue is based
on, among other things, the difference between the exchange rate assigned to the currency conversion made
under the deposit agreement and the rate that the depositary bank or its affiliate receives when buying or
selling foreign currency for its own account. The depositary bank makes no representation that the exchange
rate used or obtained by it or its affiliate in any currency conversion under the deposit agreement will be the
most favorable rate that could be obtained at the time or that the method by which that rate will be
determined will be the most favorable to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, subject to the depositary bank’s
obligation to act without negligence or bad faith. The methodology used to determine exchange rates used in
currency conversions made by the depositary bank is available upon request. Where the custodian converts
currency, the custodian has no obligation to obtain the most favorable rate that could be obtained at the time
or to ensure that the method by which that rate will be determined will be the most favorable to Rentokil
Initial ADS Holders, and the depositary bank makes no representation that the rate is the most favorable rate
and will not be liable for any direct or indirect losses associated with the rate. In certain instances, the
depositary bank may receive dividends or other distributions from Rentokil Initial in U.S. dollars that
represent the proceeds of a conversion of foreign currency or translation from foreign currency at a rate that
was obtained or determined by Rentokil Initial and, in such cases, the depositary bank will not engage in, or
be responsible for, any foreign currency transactions and neither it nor Rentokil Initial makes any
representation that the rate obtained or determined by Rentokil Initial is the most favorable rate and neither it
nor Rentokil Initial will be liable for any direct or indirect losses associated with the rate.",219,220

calculated by reference to net income received or receivable by the depositary bank or the custodian)
payable on your Rentokil Initial ADSs or on the deposited securities represented by any of your Rentokil
Initial ADSs. The depositary bank may refuse to register any transfer of your Rentokil Initial ADSs or allow
you to withdraw the deposited securities represented by your Rentokil Initial ADSs until those taxes or other
charges are paid. It may apply payments owed to you or sell deposited securities represented by your
Rentokil Initial ADSs to pay any taxes owed and you will remain liable for any deficiency. If the depositary
bank sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce the number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to reflect the
sale and pay to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders any proceeds, or send to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders any
property, remaining after it has paid the taxes.

The depositary bank will not tender deposited securities in any voluntary tender, exchange offer or similar
offer unless instructed to do so by a Rentokil Initial ADS Holder surrendering Rentokil Initial ADSs and
subject to any conditions or procedures the depositary bank may establish.

If there is any change in the deposited securities such as a split-up, combination or other reclassification, or
any merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization affecting the issuer of deposited securities in
which the depositary bank receives new securities in exchange for or in lieu of the old deposited securities,

converts currency itself or through any of its affiliates, the depositary bank acts as principal for its own
account and not as agent, advisor, broker or fiduciary on behalf of any other person and earns revenue,
including, without limitation, transaction spreads, that it will retain for its own account. The revenue is based
on, among other things, the difference between the exchange rate assigned to the currency conversion made
under the deposit agreement and the rate that the depositary bank or its affiliate receives when buying or
selling foreign currency for its own account. The depositary bank makes no representation that the exchange
rate used or obtained by it or its affiliate in any currency conversion under the deposit agreement will be the
most favorable rate that could be obtained at the time or that the method by which that rate will be
determined will be the most favorable to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, subject to the depositary bank’s
obligation to act without negligence or bad faith. The methodology used to determine exchange rates used in
currency conversions made by the depositary bank is available upon request. Where the custodian converts
currency, the custodian has no obligation to obtain the most favorable rate that could be obtained at the time
or to ensure that the method by which that rate will be determined will be the most favorable to Rentokil
Initial ADS Holders, and the depositary bank makes no representation that the rate is the most favorable rate
and will not be liable for any direct or indirect losses associated with the rate. In certain instances, the
depositary bank may receive dividends or other distributions from Rentokil Initial in U.S. dollars that
represent the proceeds of a conversion of foreign currency or translation from foreign currency at a rate that
was obtained or determined by Rentokil Initial and, in such cases, the depositary bank will not engage in, or
be responsible for, any foreign currency transactions and neither it nor Rentokil Initial makes any
representation that the rate obtained or determined by Rentokil Initial is the most favorable rate and neither it
nor Rentokil Initial will be liable for any direct or indirect losses associated with the rate.
Payment of Taxes
You will be responsible for any taxes or other governmental charges (other than taxes imposed on or
calculated by reference to net income received or receivable by the depositary bank or the custodian)
payable on your Rentokil Initial ADSs or on the deposited securities represented by any of your Rentokil
Initial ADSs. The depositary bank may refuse to register any transfer of your Rentokil Initial ADSs or allow
you to withdraw the deposited securities represented by your Rentokil Initial ADSs until those taxes or other
charges are paid. It may apply payments owed to you or sell deposited securities represented by your
Rentokil Initial ADSs to pay any taxes owed and you will remain liable for any deficiency. If the depositary
bank sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce the number of Rentokil Initial ADSs to reflect the
sale and pay to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders any proceeds, or send to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders any
property, remaining after it has paid the taxes.
Tender and Exchange Offers; Redemption, Replacement or Cancellation of Deposited Securities
The depositary bank will not tender deposited securities in any voluntary tender, exchange offer or similar
offer unless instructed to do so by a Rentokil Initial ADS Holder surrendering Rentokil Initial ADSs and
subject to any conditions or procedures the depositary bank may establish.
If deposited securities are redeemed for cash in a transaction that is mandatory for the depositary bank as a
holder of deposited securities, the depositary bank will call for surrender of a corresponding number of
Rentokil Initial ADSs and distribute the net redemption money to the holders of called Rentokil Initial ADSs
upon surrender of those Rentokil Initial ADSs.
If there is any change in the deposited securities such as a split-up, combination or other reclassification, or
any merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization affecting the issuer of deposited securities in
which the depositary bank receives new securities in exchange for or in lieu of the old deposited securities,
the depositary bank will hold those replacement securities as deposited securities under the deposit
agreement. However, if the depositary bank decides it would not be lawful and practical to hold the
replacement securities because those securities could not be distributed to Rentokil Initial ADS Holders or
206 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
for any other reason, the depositary bank may instead sell the replacement securities and distribute the net
proceeds upon surrender of the Rentokil Initial ADSs.
If there is a replacement of the deposited securities and the depositary bank will continue to hold the
replacement securities, the depositary bank may distribute new Rentokil Initial ADSs representing the new
deposited securities or ask you to surrender your outstanding ADRs in exchange for new ADRs identifying
the new deposited securities.

If there are no deposited securities underlying Rentokil Initial ADS, including if the deposited securities are
cancelled, or if the deposited securities underlying Rentokil Initial ADSs have become apparently worthless,
the depositary bank may call for surrender of those Rentokil Initial ADSs or cancel those Rentokil Initial
ADSs upon notice to the Rentokil Initial ADS Holders.",220,221
TERMINIX GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC_20220907_DEFM14A_20330027_4514503.Pdf,Amendment and Termination,"Amendment and Termination
Rentokil Initial may agree with the depositary bank to amend the deposit agreement and the ADRs without
your consent for any reason. If an amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other
governmental charges or expenses of the depositary bank for registration fees, facsimile costs, delivery
charges or similar items, or prejudices a substantial right (including, without limitation, any economic, voting
or other material right) of Rentokil Initial ADS Holders, it will not become effective for outstanding Rentokil
Initial ADSs until 30 days after the depositary bank notifies Rentokil Initial ADS Holders of the amendment.
At the time an amendment becomes effective, you are considered, by continuing to hold your Rentokil Initial
ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the ADRs and the deposit agreement as amended.
The depositary bank will initiate termination of the deposit agreement if Rentokil Initial instructs it to do so.
The depositary bank may initiate termination of the deposit agreement if:
60 days have passed since the depositary bank told Rentokil Initial it wants to resign, but a successor
depositary bank has not been appointed and accepted its appointment;
Rentokil Initial delists the Rentokil Initial ADSs from an exchange in the United States on which they
were listed and, 30 days after the delisting, does not list the Rentokil Initial ADSs on another
exchange in the United States or makes arrangements for trading of Rentokil Initial ADSs on the U.S.
over-the-counter market;
Rentokil Initial delists its Rentokil Initial ordinary shares from an exchange outside the United States
on which they were listed and does not list the Rentokil Initial ordinary shares on another exchange
outside the United States;
the depositary bank has reason to believe the Rentokil Initial ADSs have become, or will become,
ineligible for registration on Form F-6 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933;
Rentokil Initial appears to be insolvent or enters insolvency proceedings;
all or substantially all the value of the deposited securities has been distributed either in cash or in
the form of securities;
there are no deposited securities underlying the Rentokil Initial ADSs or the underlying deposited
securities have become apparently worthless; or
there has been a replacement of deposited securities.
If the deposit agreement will terminate, the depositary bank will notify Rentokil Initial ADS Holders at least
90 days before the termination date. At any time after the termination date, the depositary bank may sell the
deposited securities. After that, the depositary bank will hold the money it received on the sale, as well as
any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement, unsegregated and without liability for interest, for
the pro rata benefit of the Rentokil Initial ADS Holders that have not surrendered their Rentokil Initial ADSs.
Normally, the depositary bank will sell as soon as practicable after the termination date.

After the termination date and before the depositary bank sells, Rentokil Initial ADS Holders can still
surrender their Rentokil Initial ADSs and receive delivery of deposited securities, except that the depositary
bank may refuse to accept a surrender for the purpose of withdrawing deposited securities or reverse
previously accepted surrenders of that kind that have not settled if it would interfere with the selling
process. The depositary bank may refuse to accept a surrender for the purpose of withdrawing sale proceeds
until all the deposited securities have been sold. The depositary bank will continue to collect distributions
on deposited securities, but, after the termination date, the depositary bank is not required to register any
transfer of Rentokil Initial ADSs or distribute any dividends or other distributions on deposited securities to
the Rentokil Initial ADS Holder (until they surrender their Rentokil Initial ADSs) or give any notices or
perform any other duties under the deposit agreement except as described in this paragraph.",221,222

In the deposit agreement, all parties to the deposit agreement acknowledge that DRS and Profile will apply to
the Rentokil Initial ADSs. DRS is a system administered by DTC that facilitates interchange between
registered holding of uncertificated ADSs and holding of security entitlements in ADSs through DTC and a
DTC participant. Profile is a feature of DRS that allows a DTC participant, claiming to act on behalf of a
registered holder of uncertificated ADSs, to direct the depositary bank to register a transfer of those ADSs
to DTC or its nominee and to deliver those ADSs to the DTC account of that DTC participant without receipt
by the depositary bank of prior authorization from the ADS holder to register that transfer.
In connection with and in accordance with the arrangements and procedures relating to DRS/Profile, the
parties to the deposit agreement understand that the depositary bank will not determine whether the DTC
participant that is claiming to be acting on behalf of a Rentokil Initial ADS Holder in requesting registration
of transfer and delivery as described in the paragraph above has the actual authority to act on behalf of the
Rentokil Initial ADS Holder (notwithstanding any requirements under the Uniform Commercial Code). In the

that, unless Rentokil Initial shareholders determine
otherwise by ordinary resolution, the number of
directors (disregarding alternate directors) shall be
not less than three.
The number of directors of the Rentokil Initial board
of directors is currently set at eight.
The business of Rentokil Initial shall be managed by
the directors who, subject to the provisions of the
articles of association and to any directions given
by Rentokil Initial shareholders by special
resolution to take, or refrain from taking, specified
action, may exercise all the powers of Rentokil
Initial. Under English law, a special resolution means

75% of the shareholders or holders of 75% of the

the terms of reference for such committees.
The Rentokil Initial board of directors has
established three principal board committees: audit
committee, nomination committee and remuneration
committee. The composition of the audit committee,
nomination committee and remuneration committee
is determined in line with the UK Corporate
Governance Code.
Notwithstanding the fact that there is no age limit
requirement for directors to retire, at each Rentokil
Initial annual general meeting, Rentokil Initial’s
articles of association provide that all directors shall
retire annually. In line with the recommendations of
the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the
directors wishing to continue serving, and
considered eligible by the Rentokil Initial board of
directors, offer themselves for re-election at every
annual general meeting. Under the UK Corporate
Governance Code, a majority of the board of
directors (other than the Chair) are required to be
independent.
Under English law, any agreement under which a
director agrees to perform services (as a director or
otherwise) for a company or its subsidiaries is
defined as a service agreement. Service agreements
with a guaranteed term of more than two years
require prior approval by the shareholders by
ordinary resolution at a general meeting. English law
permits a company to provide for terms of different
lengths for its directors.
Nomination of Directors
No person (other than a director retiring at the
general meeting in question) shall be appointed or
reappointed a director at any general meeting unless
he or she is recommended by the board or notice of
the intention to propose such person for
appointment or reappointment executed by a
shareholder qualified to vote on the appointment or
reappointment is given to Rentokil Initial not less
than seven nor more than 42 days before the date
appointed for holding the meeting.
The Terminix bylaws provide that nominations of
persons for election to the Terminix board of
directors may be made at an annual meeting of
stockholders, in accordance with certain notice
provisions, by or at the direction of the Terminix
board of directors or a committee thereof, or by any
Terminix stockholder entitled to vote at the annual
meeting and who is a stockholder of record at the
time the notice of nomination is delivered to Terminix
and at the date of the meeting.

of directors described above, Rentokil Initial
shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, appoint a
person who is willing to act as a director, and is
permitted by law to do so, to be a director, either to

The directors may appoint a person who is willing to
act as a director, and is permitted by law to do so, to
be a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an
additional director, provided that the appointment
does not cause the number of directors to exceed
any number fixed as the maximum number of
directors by ordinary resolution.
Any incumbent director who did not receive a
majority of votes cast for his or her election in an
uncontested election must promptly tender his or
her resignation to the Chairman of the Terminix
board of directors. The Chairman must inform the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of
such tender of resignation, and the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee must recommend
to the Terminix board of directors whether to accept
the tendered resignation or reject it or whether any
other action should be taken.
Removal of Directors
Under the UK Companies Act 2006, Rentokil Initial
shareholders may, by ordinary resolution (of which
special notice has been given in accordance with the
UK Companies Act 2006), remove any director from
office (notwithstanding any agreement to the
contrary, but without prejudice to any claim that the
director may have for the breach of such agreement)
and appoint another person to fill the vacancy. In
the absence of such appointment, the vacancy
arising upon the removal of a director from office
may be filled as a casual vacancy.
In addition to any power of removal under the UK
Companies Act 2006, Rentokil Initial shareholders
may, under the articles of association, by ordinary
resolution (of which no special notice need be
given), remove a director before the expiration of his
or her period of office and, subject to the articles of
association, may, by ordinary resolution, appoint
another person who is willing to act as a director,
and is permitted by law to do so, to be a director
instead of him or her.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation provides
that, subject to certain rights granted to certain
Terminix stockholders and rights that may be
granted to any class or series of preferred stock, a
director may be removed from office only for cause
and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Terminix stock then entitled to vote in an election of
directors.
Vacancies on the Board of Directors
The directors or the shareholders, by ordinary
resolution, may appoint a person who is willing to
act as a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an
additional director.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation provides
that, subject to certain rights granted to certain
Terminix stockholders and rights that may be
granted to any class or series of preferred stock, and
except as otherwise provided by law, any vacancy
on the Terminix board of directors must be filled by
an affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
directors then in office, even if less than a quorum,
or by a sole remaining director. A director elected to
fill a vacancy or a newly created directorship will
hold office until his or her successor has been
elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal.

Voting
A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting
(other than a general meeting held partly by means
of electronic facility) must be decided on a show of
hands unless either the notice of the meeting
specifies that a poll will be called on such resolution
or a poll is (before the resolution is put to the vote
on a show of hands or on the declaration of the
result of a show of hands on that resolution)
demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chair of
the meeting, by five or more members having the
right to vote on the resolution, by any holder(s) of
not less than 10% of the total voting rights, or by
any holder(s) of not less than 10% of the share
capital of the class, who in each case is present in
person or by proxy or corporate representative. A
resolution put to the vote of a general meeting held
partly by means of electronic facility must be
decided on a poll unless the chair of the meeting
determines that it shall be decided on a show of
hands (subject to the above rights to call a poll).
On a show of hands, every shareholder who is
present in person has one vote regardless of the
number of shares held by such shareholder. Every
proxy duly appointed by a shareholder entitled to
vote on the resolution and present has one vote.
On a poll every shareholder present in person or by
duly appointed proxy or corporate representative
has one vote for every share held by the
shareholder.
A shareholder, proxy or corporate representative
entitled to more than one vote need not, if he or she
votes, use all his or her votes or cast all the votes he
or she uses the same way.
Except as otherwise provided by the Terminix
certificate of incorporation or applicable law, each
holder of shares of Terminix common stock is
entitled, with respect to each share of Terminix
common stock held by such holder, to one vote in
person or by proxy on all matters submitted to a vote
of the holders of Terminix common stock, whether
voting separately as a class or otherwise.
Except as otherwise provided in the Terminix
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (such as with
regards to the election of directors in a contested
election, as described above under “Election of
Directors”), generally all matters at any meeting at
which a quorum is present will be decided by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
in voting power of the outstanding shares of
Terminix common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote on the subject matter in question.
Cumulative Voting
Rentokil Initial shareholders do not have the right to
cumulative voting.
Terminix stockholders do not have the right to
cumulative voting.
Shareholder Action by Written Consent
Under English law, shareholders of a public
company such as Rentokil Initial are not permitted
to pass resolutions by written consent. All
shareholder decisions must be taken at the general
meeting.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation provides
that any action required or permitted to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of Terminix
stockholders may be taken only upon the vote of the
Terminix stockholders at an annual or special
meeting duly called and may not be taken by written
consent of the stockholders.
Amendment of the Articles of Association of Rentokil Initial and the Articles of Incorporation of Terminix
Under English law, Rentokil Initial’s shareholders
may, by special resolution alter, delete, substitute,
Generally, under the DGCL, any proposal to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision of the

amend or add to its articles of association. The
Rentokil Initial board of directors is not authorized
to change its articles of association.
If at any time the capital of Rentokil Initial is divided
into different classes of shares, the rights attached
to any class may be varied, either while Rentokil
Initial is a going concern or during or in
contemplation of a winding up in such manner (if
any) as may be provided by those rights. If there are
no such provisions, the rights attaching to that
class may be varied either with the consent in
writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal
value of the issued shares of that class (not
including any treasury shares), or with the approval
of a special resolution by the Rentokil Initial
shareholders, passed at a separate meeting of the
holders of such shares, but not otherwise. The
rights attached to any class of shares will not,
unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of
issue, be deemed to be varied by: (i) the creation or
issue of further shares ranking equally with them, or
(ii) the purchase or redemption by Rentokil Initial of
any of its own shares.
Terminix certificate of incorporation requires
approval by the affirmative vote of a majority
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon.
However, the Terminix certificate of incorporation
provides that any amendment to the provisions of
the Terminix certificate of incorporation related to
“Management of Corporation,” “Stockholder Action
by Written Consent,” “Special Meetings,” “Business
Opportunities,” “Section 203 of the DGCL,”
“Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation,”
“Amendment of the By-Laws” and “Exclusive
Jurisdiction for Certain Actions,” in each case, must
be approved at a meeting of the stockholders called
for that purpose by, in addition to any other vote
otherwise required by law, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of Terminix common stock then entitled to
vote at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders.
Amendment of Bylaws
See “- Amendment of the Articles of Association of
Rentokil Initial” above.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation provides
that the Terminix board of directors may amend, by
the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
directors then in office, the Terminix bylaws, without
the vote of the Terminix stockholders.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation also
provides that the Terminix stockholders may amend,
alter or repeal the Terminix bylaws. Any such action
will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
Terminix common stock entitled to vote at any
annual or special meeting of Terminix stockholders.
Meeting Notice
An annual general meeting and all other general
meetings of Rentokil Initial must be called by at least
21 clear days’ written notice (the “clear days” rule is
set out in section 360 of the UK Companies Act 2006
and excludes the day of the meeting and the day
that the notice is given). In line with the UK
Companies Act 2006, a special resolution enabling
Rentokil Initial to hold general meetings (other than
annual general meetings) on 14 clear days’ notice
was approved at Rentokil Initial’s 2022 annual
general meeting.
The Terminix bylaws provide that notice of each
annual and special meeting of Terminix stockholders
will be given in writing, consistent with the
requirements of the DGCL, not less than 10 days nor
more than 60 days prior to the meeting to each
Terminix stockholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting.
The notice shall specify (i) the place, if any, date and
time of such meeting, (ii) the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in

The notice shall specify the time, date and place of
such general meeting, the means, or all different
means, of attendance and participation (including,

any electronic facilities the board has determined be
used to enable attendance and participation) and the
general nature of the business to be dealt with.

special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which
such meeting is called, and (iv) such other
information as may be required by law or as may be
deemed appropriate by the Chairman of the Terminix
board of directors, the Terminix Secretary or the
Terminix board of directors.
Advance Notice
In certain circumstances under the UK Companies
Act 2006, Rentokil Initial shareholders may propose
a resolution to be moved at the annual general
meeting or require Rentokil Initial to circulate to all
shareholders a statement of not more than 1,000
words in relation to a resolution or other matter to be
dealt with at a general meeting.
The company is required to give notice of such
resolution or circulate such statement once it has
received requests to do so from:
shareholders representing at least 5% of the
total voting rights of all the members who
have a relevant right to vote; or
at least 100 shareholders who have a relevant
right to vote and hold shares in the company
on which there has been paid up an average
sum, per member, of at least £100.
At an annual meeting of Terminix stockholders, for
nominations of any individual for election to the
Terminix board of directors or other business to be
timely brought, a Terminix stockholder must deliver
notice to the Terminix Secretary at the principal
executive offices of Terminix not less than 90 days
nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary
of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, in
the event the date of the annual meeting is advanced
by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 70
days from such anniversary date of the preceding
year’s annual meeting, notice by such Terminix
stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the
120  day prior to such annual meeting and not later
than the close of business on the later of the 90
day prior to such annual meeting or the close of
business on the 10  day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such meeting is
first made.
At a special meeting of Terminix stockholders called
for the purpose of electing one or more directors,
any Terminix stockholder entitled to vote at such
meeting may nominate a person or persons by
delivering to the Terminix Secretary at the principal
executive offices of Terminix not earlier than the
120  day prior to such special meeting and not later
than the close of business on the later of the 90
day prior to such special meeting or the 10  day
following the day on which public announcement is
first made of the date of the special meeting and of
the nominees proposed by the Terminix board of
directors to be elected at such meeting.
The announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual or special meeting does
not commence a new time period (and does not
extend any time period) for the giving of notice of a
stockholder nomination or a stockholder proposal as
described above.
Right to Call a Special Meeting of Shareholders
The directors may call general meetings. If there are
not sufficient directors to form a quorum in order to

call a general meeting, any director may call a
general meeting. If there is no director willing or able
to do so, any two shareholders of Rentokil Initial
may call a general meeting for the purpose of
appointing one or more directors.
The directors are required to call a general meeting if
requested by shareholders representing at least 5%
of the paid-up capital of Rentokil Initial as carries
the right of voting at general meetings (excluding
any paid-up capital held as treasury shares). Such
meeting must be called within 21 days from the date
on which the directors become subject to the
requirement, and held on a date not more than 28
days after the date of the notice calling the meeting.
The meeting may only deal with the business stated
in the request by shareholders, or as proposed by
the directors.
If the directors fail to call the general meeting
requested by the shareholders, the shareholders
who requested the meeting, or any of them
representing more than one-half of the total voting
rights of all of them, may themselves call a general
meeting. Such meeting must be called for a date not
more than three months after the date on which the
directors become subject to the requirement to call a
meeting. Any reasonable expenses incurred by the
shareholders requesting the meeting by reason of
the failure of the directors duly to call a meeting
must be reimbursed by the company.
No business other than the appointment of a
chairman shall be transacted at any general meeting
unless a quorum is present. Two persons entitled to
vote upon the business to be transacted, each being
a shareholder or a proxy for a shareholder or a duly
authorized representative of a corporation which is a
shareholder, shall be a quorum.
The directors may make arrangements for
simultaneous attendance and participation by
electronic means allowing persons not present
together at the same place to attend, speak and vote
at the meeting (including the use of satellite meeting
places).
that may be granted to any class or series of
preferred stock, special meetings of the Terminix
stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of
the Terminix board of directors or pursuant to a
resolution of the Terminix board of directors adopted
by at least a majority of the directors then in office.
Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses; Director Liability
Save as described below, under English law, any
provision that purports to exempt a director of a
company (to any extent) from any liability that
would otherwise attach to him or her in connection
with any negligence, default, breach of duty or
The Terminix bylaws provide that Terminix will
indemnify, to the full extent permitted by the DGCL
and other applicable law, any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative proceeding

breach of trust in relation to the company is void.
Subject to certain exceptions, English law does not
permit Rentokil Initial to indemnify a director against
any liability attaching to him or her in connection
with any negligence, default, breach of duty or
breach of trust in relation to Rentokil Initial. The
exceptions allow Rentokil Initial to: (1) purchase and
maintain director and officer insurance insuring its
directors or the directors of an “associated
company”  (i.e., a company that is a subsidiary of
Rentokil Initial) against any liability attaching in
connection with any negligence, default, breach of
duty or breach of trust owed to the company of
which he or she is a director; (2) provide a
qualifying third-party indemnity provision which
permits Rentokil Initial to indemnify its directors and
directors of an associated company in respect of
proceedings brought by third parties (covering both
legal costs and the amount of any adverse
judgment), except for (a) the legal costs of an
unsuccessful defense of criminal proceedings or
civil proceedings brought by the company or an
associated company, or the legal costs incurred in
connection with certain specified applications by
the director for relief where the court refuses to
grant the relief, (b) fines imposed in criminal
proceedings, and (c) penalties imposed by
regulatory bodies; (3) loan funds to a director to
meet expenditure incurred defending civil and
criminal proceedings against him or her (even if the
action is brought by the company itself), or
expenditure incurred applying for certain specified
relief, subject to the requirement that the loan must
be on terms that it is repaid if the defense or
application for relief is unsuccessful; and (4)
provide a qualifying pension scheme indemnity
provision, which allows the company to indemnify a
director of a company that is a trustee of an
occupational pension scheme against liability
incurred in connection with such director’s
activities as a trustee of the scheme (subject to
certain exceptions).
Under the Rentokil Initial articles of association,
subject to the UK Companies Act 2006 (including as
set out above), Rentokil Initial may do any or all of
the following:
indemnify every director or other officer of
Rentokil Initial (other than any person (whether
an officer or not) engaged by the Company as
auditor) out of the assets of Rentokil Initial
against any liability incurred by such director or
other officer for negligence, default, breach of
duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs
(i) by reason of the fact that (x) such person is or
was serving or has agreed to serve as a Terminix
director or officer, or (y) such person, while serving
as a Terminix director or officer, is or was serving or
has agreed to serve, in each case, at the request of
Terminix as a director, officer, employee, manager or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise or (z) such person
is or was serving or has agreed to serve, in each
case, at the request of Terminix as a director, officer
or manager of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) by reason of
any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by
such person in such capacity, and who satisfies the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL
or other applicable law.
Terminix will indemnify such individuals (i) in a
proceeding (other than a proceeding by or in the
right of Terminix) against expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
such person or on such person’s behalf in
connection with such proceeding and any appeal
therefrom or (ii) in a proceeding by or in the right of
Terminix to procure a judgment in its favor, against
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person or on such
person’s behalf in connection with the defense or
settlement of such proceeding and any appeal
therefrom.
The Terminix bylaws also provide that Terminix will
advance all expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) incurred by a present or former
director or officer in defending any proceeding prior
to the final disposition of such proceeding upon
written request of such person and delivery of an
undertaking by such person to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such person is
not entitled to be indemnified by Terminix.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation provides
that no Terminix director will be liable to Terminix or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
his or her fiduciary duty as a director. But Terminix
directors may face liability (a) for any breach of the
director’s duty of loyalty to Terminix or its
stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of the law, (c) under Section 174
of the DGCL or (d) for any transaction from which
the director derived an improper personal benefit.

who is or was (i) a director, officer, or employee
of Rentokil Initial, or anybody which is or was

of Rentokil Initial, or in which Rentokil Initial or
such holding company or subsidiary
undertaking has or had any interest (whether
direct or indirect) or with which Rentokil Initial

undertaking is or was in any way allied or

actual or purported execution or discharge of
that person’s duties or in the exercise or
purported exercise of that person’s powers or
otherwise in relation to that person’s duties,
powers or offices in relation to the relevant body
or fund.
Appraisal and Dissenters Rights
English law does not generally provide for appraisal
rights.
However, in the event of a compulsory acquisition
or “squeeze out,” under the UK Companies Act
2006, where (a) a “takeover offer” is made for the
shares of a company incorporated in the UK, and (b)
the offeror has acquired or unconditionally
contracted to acquire at least 90% in value of the
shares of any class to which the offer relates
representing at least 90% of the voting rights carried
by those shares, the offeror may, within three
months beginning on the day after the last day on
which the offer could be accepted, require
shareholders who did not accept the offer to transfer
their shares to the offeror on the terms of the offer.
A dissenting shareholder may object to the transfer
or its proposed terms by applying to the court
within six weeks of the date on which notice of the
required transfer was given by the offeror.
The court may, on receiving such an application,
order (a) that the offeror is not entitled and bound to
acquire the shares to which the notice relates or (b)
that the terms on which the offeror is entitled and
bound to acquire the shares shall be such as the
court thinks fit.
A minority shareholder is entitled, in circumstances
Under the DGCL, a stockholder may dissent from,
and receive payments in cash for, the fair value of
his or her shares as appraised by the Delaware Court
of Chancery in the event of certain mergers and
consolidations. However, stockholders do not have
appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold, at
the record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders to act
upon the merger or consolidation, or on the record
date with respect to action by written consent, are
either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
(ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders.
Further, no appraisal rights are available to
stockholders of the surviving corporation if the
merger did not require the vote of the stockholders
of the surviving corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are
available if stockholders are required by the terms of
the merger agreement to accept for their shares
anything other than (a) shares of stock of the
surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another
corporation that will either be listed on a national
securities exchange or held of record by more than
2,000 holders, (c) cash instead of fractional shares or
(d) any combination of clauses (a)  - (c). Appraisal
rights are also available under the DGCL in certain
other circumstances, including

similar to the “squeeze out” described above, to
require the offeror to acquire his or her shares on
the same terms as those contained in the original
offer. The period within which the offeree
shareholder must exercise his or her rights is the
later of: (a) three months from the close of the offer
and (b) three months from when the bidder gives the
shareholder notice of his or her rights.
in certain parent-subsidiary corporation mergers and
in certain circumstances where the certificate of
incorporation so provides.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation does not
provide for appraisal rights in any additional
circumstance.
Dividends and Repurchases
Pursuant to the Rentokil Initial articles of
association, the shareholders may, by ordinary
resolution, declare dividends but may not declare
dividends in excess of the amount recommended by
the directors. The directors may also pay interim
dividends if it appears that such dividends are
justified by the profits available for distribution. No
dividend shall be paid otherwise than out of profits
available for distribution as specified under the
provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.
The directors may, if authorized by ordinary
resolution, offer Rentokil Initial shareholders the
right to elect to receive, in lieu of a dividend, an
allotment of new ordinary shares, credited as fully
paid.
The directors may, if authorized by ordinary
resolution, determine that an interim dividend shall
be wholly or partly satisfied by the distribution of
assets.
Once approved by Rentokil Initial shareholders by
ordinary resolution and subject to certain
procedural requirements of the UK Companies Act
2006, Rentokil Initial may repurchase its own shares.
Shareholders may approve two different types of
such share purchases:  on-market purchases or off-
market purchases. A purchase is an on-market
purchase if it is made on a recognized investment
exchange and is not an off-market purchase. A
purchase is off-market if the shares are not
purchased on a recognized investment exchange or
are purchased on a recognized investment exchange
but are not subject to a marketing arrangement on
that exchange.
A resolution passed at Rentokil Initial’s 2022 annual
general meeting provides the directors with
authority to purchase up to 10% of Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares in issue (excluding any treasury
shares) as of March 23, 2022, such authority
expiring on the earlier of the conclusion of Rentokil
Initial’s 2023 annual general meeting or August 11,
2023.
Distributions/Dividends
Under the DGCL, Terminix stockholders are entitled
to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the
Terminix board of directors. The Terminix board of
directors may declare and pay a dividend to Terminix
stockholders out of surplus or, if there is no surplus,
out of net profits for the year in which the dividend
is declared or the immediately preceding fiscal year,
or both, provided that such payment would not
reduce capital below the amount of capital
represented by all classes of outstanding stock
having a preference as to the distribution of assets
upon liquidation. A dividend may be paid in cash, in
shares of common stock or in other property.
Repurchases/Redemptions
Under the DGCL, Terminix may redeem or repurchase
shares of its own common stock, except that
generally it may not redeem or repurchase those
shares if the capital of Terminix is impaired at the
time or would become impaired as a result of the
redemption or repurchase of such shares. If Terminix
were to designate and issue shares of a series of
preferred stock that is redeemable in accordance
with its terms, such terms would govern the
redemption of such shares. Repurchased and
redeemed shares may be retired or held as treasury
shares. Shares that have been repurchased but have
not been retired may be resold by Terminix for such
consideration as the Terminix board of directors may
determine in its discretion.
Purchases by Subsidiaries of Terminix
Under the DGCL, Terminix common stock may be
acquired by subsidiaries of Terminix without
stockholder approval. Shares of such common stock
owned by a majority-owned subsidiary are neither
entitled to vote nor counted as outstanding for
quorum purposes.

Rentokil Initial can redeem or repurchase shares
only if (1) the shares are fully paid and (2) payment
for the redemption or repurchase is made out of (a)
distributable profits or (b) the proceeds of a new
issue of shares made for the purpose of the
repurchase or redemption.
If Rentokil Initial is wound up, the liquidator may,
with the approval of shareholders by a special
resolution and any other approvals required by law,
divide among the shareholders in specie the whole
or any part of the assets of Rentokil Initial and may,
for that purpose, value any assets and determine
how the division shall be carried out as between the
shareholders or different classes of shareholders.
The liquidator may, with such approvals, vest the
whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon
such trusts for the benefit of the shareholders as he
or she may with the like sanction determine, but no
shareholder shall be compelled to accept any assets
upon which there is a liability.
Required Shareholder Votes for Certain Transactions
The following matters, among others, require
shareholder approval and, for a UK listed company,
therefore have to be exclusively approved at a
general meeting:
Matters requiring special resolution:
amendments to the articles of association;
change to the company’s name;
reduction of the notice required for a
general meeting (other than an annual
general meeting) from 21 days to 14 days;
reductions of capital; and
disapplication (or renewal of
disapplication) of preemption rights where
directors are acting under a general
authority to allot.
Matters requiring ordinary resolution:
removal of directors;
approval of directors’ long-term service
contracts;
approvals of loans, quasi loans, credit
transactions, substantial property
transactions, etc., with directors, and
persons connected with directors;
approval of directors’ remuneration report
and policy;
Under Delaware law, a sale, lease or exchange of all
or substantially all of a corporation’s assets, a
merger or consolidation of a corporation with
another corporation or a dissolution of a corporation
generally requires the approval of the corporation’s
board of directors and, with limited exceptions, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the aggregate voting
power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on
the transaction.

purchase of shares.
Certain of the matters requiring ordinary and special
resolutions listed above are proposed and voted on
annually by shareholders at Rentokil Initial’s annual
general meeting.
State Antitakeover Statutes and Certain Articles of Incorporation Provisions
Under English law, Rentokil Initial’s directors have a
fiduciary duty to take only those actions that are in
the interests of the company as a whole. Generally,
anti-takeover measures are not actions that fall
within this category.
Rentokil Initial is subject to the City Code on
Takeovers and Mergers, which governs the conduct
of mergers and takeovers in the UK. Any takeover of
Rentokil Initial would have to be in accordance with
this Code.
There are no provisions in the Rentokil Initial
articles of association that would have an effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover by, or
change of control of, Rentokil Initial.
Terminix is subject to the provisions of Section 203
of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prohibits a
publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in
a business combination with any interested
stockholder for a three-year period following the
time that such stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder, unless the board of directors approves
the business combination or the transaction by
which such stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder, in either case, before the stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder acquires 85% of the corporation’s
outstanding voting stock in the transaction by
which such stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder, or the business combination is
subsequently approved by the board of directors
and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 ∕3% of
the corporation’s outstanding voting stock not
owned by the interested stockholder.
Preemptive Rights
English law provides for statutory preemption rights
that apply on an allotment of equity securities. Such
rights can be disapplied by a special resolution
passed by shareholders at a general meeting.
On May 11, 2022 at the annual general meeting of
Rentokil Initial:
i. In line with the Investment Association guideline
limits, an ordinary resolution was passed granting
directors the authority to allot shares in the capital
of Rentokil Initial up to a maximum nominal
Terminix stockholders do not have preemptive rights
to acquire newly issued capital stock.

amount of: (1) £6,212,000 representing approximately
one-third of Rentokil Initial’s issued ordinary share
capital (excluding treasury shares) as of March 23,
2022, and (2) a further amount of £6,212,000,
representing approximately one-third of Rentokil
Initial’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding
treasury shares) as of March 23, 2022, pursuant to a
rights issue only; and
ii. Two special resolutions were passed granting
directors the authority to allot shares for cash on a
non-preemptive basis otherwise than in connection
with an offer to existing shareholders up to a
maximum nominal value of £931,000 representing
approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share
capital of Rentokil Initial (excluding treasury shares)
as of March 23, 2022, and up to a further maximum
nominal value of £931,000 representing
approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share
capital of Rentokil Initial (excluding treasury shares)
as of March 23, 2022 for the purposes of financing
an acquisition (or refinancing, if the authority is to
be used within six months after the original
transaction) or capital investment.
This allotment authority expires on the earlier of (1)
the 2023 annual general meeting of Rentokil Initial
and (2) August 11, 2023.
The Rentokil Initial directors have confirmed their
intention to follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption
Group’s Statement of Principles (the “Principles”)
regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a
rolling three-year period. The Principles provide that
companies should not issue shares for cash
representing more than 7.5% of a company’s issued
share capital (excluding treasury shares) in any
rolling three-year period, other than to existing
shareholders, without prior consultation with
shareholders.
Fiduciary Duties
Under English law, Rentokil Initial’s directors have a
statutory and fiduciary duty to take only those
actions that are in the interests of the company as a
whole. See also “- Conflicts of Interest” below.
Pursuant to the UK Companies Act 2006, directors
must:
act in a way he or she considers, in good
faith, would be most likely to promote the
success of the company for the benefit of its
shareholders as a whole;
act in accordance with the company’s
Under Delaware law, the directors of Terminix owe a
duty of care and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care
requires that directors act on an informed basis after
due consideration of the relevant materials and
appropriate deliberation. The duty of care also
requires that directors exercise care in overseeing
and investigating the conduct of corporate
employees. The duty of loyalty requires directors to
act in what they reasonably believe to be the best
interests of the company and its stockholders
without any conflict of interest. A party challenging

with the company.
typically bears the burden of rebutting the
applicability of the “business judgment rule”
presumption, which presumes that directors acted in
accordance with the duties of care and loyalty.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Delaware courts
may subject directors’ conduct to enhanced scrutiny
of, among other matters, defensive actions taken in
response to a threat to corporate control and
approval of a transaction resulting in a sale of
control of the corporation.
Under Delaware law, a member of the board of
directors, or a member of any committee designated
by the board of directors, is, in the performance of
such member’s duties, fully protected in relying in
good faith upon the records of the corporation and
upon such information, opinions, reports or
statements presented to the corporation by any of
the corporation’s officers or employees, or
committees of the board of directors, or by any other
person as to matters the member reasonably believes
are within such other person’s professional or expert
competence and who has been selected with
reasonable care by or on behalf of the corporation.
Exclusive Forum
Rentokil Initial’s articles of association do not
stipulate an exclusive forum for a derivative action
brought by a Rentokil Initial shareholder pursuant to
the UK Companies Act 2006. However, the
Companies Act 2006 requires that a shareholder of a
company who brings a derivative claim or seeks to
continue a claim as a derivative claim must apply to
the courts of England and Wales for permission to
continue the claim.
The Terminix certification of incorporation provides
that, unless Terminix consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Delaware Court
of Chancery is, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative
action or proceeding brought on behalf of Terminix,
(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer,
employee or agent of Terminix to Terminix or its
stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim
arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the
Terminix certification of incorporation or bylaws or
(iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the
internal affairs doctrine.
Conflicts of Interest
Under English law, a director is under a duty to
avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can
have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the
company and is obliged to declare his or her interest
in a proposed or ongoing transaction to the other
directors. It is an offense to fail to declare an
interest.
A director shall not vote at a meeting of the directors
on any resolution concerning a matter in
Under Delaware law, a contract or transaction in
which a director has an interest will not be voidable
solely for this reason if (i) the material facts about
such interested director’s interest are disclosed or
are known to the board of directors or an informed
and properly functioning independent committee
thereof, and a majority of disinterested directors or
such committee in good faith authorizes the
transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the disinterested directors, (ii) the material facts

which he or she has, directly or indirectly, an
interest which could reasonably be regarded as
likely to give rise to a conflict of interest (other than
an interest in shares, debentures or other securities
of, or otherwise in or through, Rentokil Initial)
unless his or her interest arises only because the
case falls within one or more of the exceptions listed
in the articles of association.
The duty to avoid a conflict of interest is not
infringed if the situation cannot reasonably be
regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest
or if the matter has been authorized by the directors
in accordance with the articles of association.
Provided that the director has declared his or her
interest to the other directors, a director
notwithstanding his or her office may, generally (i)
be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any
transaction or arrangement with the company or in
which the company is directly or indirectly
interested; or (ii) be a director or other officer of, or
employed by, or a party to any transaction or
arrangement with, or otherwise be interested in, any
body corporate in which the company is directly or
indirectly interested or with which the director has
such a relationship at the request or direction of the
company.
about such interested director’s relationship or
interest are disclosed or are known to the
stockholders entitled to vote on such transaction,
and the transaction is specifically approved in good
faith by vote of the majority of shares entitled to
vote thereon or (iii) the transaction is fair to the
corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved
or ratified. The mere fact that an interested director
is present and voting on a transaction in which he or
she is interested will not itself make the transaction
void. Interested directors may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the board of directors or of a committee that
authorizes the contract or transaction.
Under Delaware law, an interested director could be
held liable for a transaction in which such director
derived an improper personal benefit.
Non-Competition Provisions
The Rentokil Initial articles of association do not
contain any non-competition provisions.
The Terminix certificate of incorporation and bylaws
do not contain any non-competitive provisions.
Rights of Inspections
Under English law, a company must retain and keep
available for inspection by shareholders free of
charge, and by any other person on payment of a
prescribed fee, its register of shareholders. It must
also keep available for inspection by shareholders
free of charge records of all resolutions and
meetings by shareholders and, for a fee, provide
copies of the minutes to shareholders who request
them. Shareholders may also inspect the service
contracts of directors at Rentokil Initial’s registered
offices during business hours.
In each case, the records of all resolutions and
meetings by shareholders should be kept for at least
10 years. These records may be kept in electronic
form, as long as they are capable of being produced
in hard copy form.
The Rentokil Initial articles of association provide
Under Section 220 of the DGCL, a stockholder or its
agent has a right to inspect Terminix’s stock ledger,
a list of all of its stockholders and its other books
and records during the usual hours of business
upon written demand stating his purpose (which
must be reasonably related to such person’s interest
as a stockholder). If Terminix refuses to permit such
inspection or refuses to reply to the request within
five business days of the demand, the stockholder
may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for an
order to compel such inspection.

that no shareholder of Rentokil Initial or other
person shall have any right to inspect any
accounting or other book or document of the
company except as conferred by statute or ordered
by a court of competent jurisdiction or authorized
by the directors or shareholders.
Shareholder Suits
The UK Companies Act 2006 provides limited
circumstances in which a shareholder of a company
may bring a derivative claim on behalf of the
company. Such a claim may only be brought in
respect of a cause of action arising from an actual or
proposed act or omission involving negligence,
default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a
director of the company. It is immaterial whether the
cause of action arose before or after the person
seeking to bring the claim became a shareholder of
the company. A person seeking to bring a derivative
claim must obtain the permission of the courts of
England and Wales to continue that claim after
issue.
The courts of England and Wales must refuse the
claim if the action would not promote the success of
the company, or the company authorized the
director’s action or omission before it occurred, or
has since ratified the action or omission (in both
cases provided the act is capable of authorization or
ratification). If there is no absolute bar to continuing
the claim, the courts of England and Wales must
consider the following (non-exhaustive) factors: (a)
whether the shareholder is acting in good faith, (b)
the importance that a person acting in accordance
with the duty to promote the success of the
company would accord to the proposed claim, (c)
whether a proposed or past act or omission would
be likely to be authorized or ratified, (d) whether the
company has decided not to pursue the claim, (e)
whether the shareholder has a cause of action that
he or she may pursue in his or her own right rather
than on behalf of the company and (f) the views of
the shareholders of the company who have no
personal direct or indirect interest in the matter.
The UK Companies Act 2006 also permits a
shareholder to apply to the courts of England and
Wales for relief on the grounds that: (1) the
company’s affairs are being or have been conducted
in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of all
or some shareholders, including the shareholder
making the claim or (2) any act or omission of the
company is or would be so prejudicial.
Generally, Terminix is subject to potential liability
under the federal securities laws and under Delaware
law. Under the DGCL, a stockholder may bring a
derivative action on behalf of the corporation to
enforce the rights of the corporation. Generally, a
person may institute and maintain such a suit only if
such person was a stockholder at the time of the
transaction that is the subject of the suit or his or
her shares thereafter devolved upon him or her by
operation of law. The DGCL also requires that the
derivative plaintiff make a demand on the directors
of the corporation to assert the corporate claim
before the suit may be prosecuted by the derivative
plaintiff, unless such demand would be futile. In
certain circumstances, class action lawsuits are
available to stockholders.

The UK Limitation Act 1980 imposes a limitation
period, with certain exceptions, of civil claims. The
period is six years in respect of actions in contract
and tort, and 12 years for breach of any obligation
contained in a deed. The period starts to run on the
date that the action accrued. In the case of contract,
this is the date on which the breach occurred, and in
tort this is the date on which the damage occurred.
Disclosure Interest in Shares
There are no provisions in the Rentokil Initial
articles of association whereby persons acquiring,
holding or disposing of a certain percentage of
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares are required to make
disclosure of their ownership percentage, although
there are such requirements under statute and
regulation.
The basic disclosure requirement under Rule 5 of the
Disclosure Guidance and the Transparency Rules
made by the FCA under Part VI of FSMA imposes a
statutory obligation on a person to notify Rentokil
Initial and the Financial Conduct Authority of the
percentage of the voting rights in Rentokil Initial he
or she holds or is deemed to hold, through his or her
direct or indirect holding of certain financial
instruments, if the percentage of those voting
rights:
reaches, exceeds or falls below 3% and/or
any subsequent whole percentage figure as a
result of an acquisition or disposal of shares
or financial instruments; or
reaches, exceeds or falls below any such
threshold as a result of any change in the
number of voting rights attached to shares in
Rentokil Initial.
The Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules
set out in detail the circumstances in which an
obligation of disclosure will arise, as well as certain
exemptions from those obligations for specified
persons.
Under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006,
Rentokil Initial may, by notice in writing, require a
person that Rentokil Initial knows or has reasonable
cause to believe has or had during the three years
preceding the date of notice an interest in Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares, to indicate whether or not
that is the case and, if that person does or did hold
an interest in Rentokil Initial ordinary shares, to
provide certain information as set out in that Act.
Under the FCA’s Listing Rules, Rentokil Initial is
Neither the DGCL nor the Terminix certificate of
incorporation or bylaws impose an obligation with
respect to disclosure by stockholders of their
interests in Terminix common stock, except as part of
a stockholder’s nomination of director or
stockholder proposals to be made at an annual
meeting.
Under the U.S. Exchange Act, all beneficial owners
of holders of 5% or greater of the outstanding
shares of Terminix’s capital stock must report their
holdings to the SEC on “Schedule 13G” if the
holdings are passive and held not with an intent to
acquire control and on “Schedule 13D” if the
holdings are non-passive and held with an intent to
acquire control.
Terminix is required by the rules of the SEC to
disclose in the proxy statement relating to its annual
meeting of stockholders the identity and number of
shares of Terminix voting securities beneficially
owned by:
each of its directors;
its principal executive officer;
its principal financial officer;
each of its three most highly compensated
executive officers other than its principal
executive officer and its principal financial
officer;
all of its directors and executive officers as a
group; and
any beneficial owner of 5% or more of Terminix
voting securities of which Terminix is aware.

The Market Abuse Regulation imposes an
obligation of disclosure on “persons discharging
managerial responsibility”  (including directors) and
their “closely associated” persons (in each case, as
defined therein) to notify Rentokil Initial and the
Financial Conduct Authority of every transaction
relating to the shares or debt instruments of
Rentokil Initial.
The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers also
imposes strict disclosure requirements with regard
to dealings in the securities of an offeror or offeree
company on all parties to a takeover and also on
their respective associates during the course of an
offer period.
The Market Abuse Regulation prohibits any person
from dealing in shares when in possession of inside
information. The Market Abuse Regulation also
prohibits directors and other persons discharging
management responsibilities from dealing in Rentokil
Initial securities during the 30-day period before the
announcement of interim or annual financial results.
Related Party Transactions
Under the FCA’s Listing Rules, the definition of a
related party includes substantial shareholders (i.e.,
any person who is entitled to exercise, or to control
the exercise of, 10% or more of the votes able to be
cast at general meetings of Rentokil Initial), directors
and certain former directors, anyone who “exercises
significant influence over the company” or any
associate of a related party.
Certain tests (“class tests”) are used to assess the
impact of the related party transaction on the listed
company.
Rentokil Initial’s reporting obligations would be
dependent on the outcome of the class tests.
Depending on the size of the transaction, no action
may be required; Rentokil Initial may have to obtain
confirmation from a sponsor that the terms of the
proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and
announce details relating to the transaction as soon
as possible; or Rentokil Initial may need to obtain
shareholder approval at a general meeting prior to
entering into the transaction.

transactions between a director (or a person
connected with a director) and a related company of
The Terminix board of directors has approved written
policies and procedures with respect to the review
and approval of certain transactions between
Terminix and a “Related Person,” or a “Related
Person Transaction”  (the “Related Person
Transaction Policy”). Pursuant to the terms of the
Related Person Transaction Policy, the Terminix
board of directors must review and decide whether
to approve or ratify any Related Person Transaction.
Any Related Person Transaction is required to be
reported to the Terminix legal department, and the
legal department will then determine whether it
should be submitted to the Terminix Audit Committee
for consideration.
For the purposes of the Related Person Transaction
Policy, a “Related Person Transaction” is a
transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any
series of similar transactions, arrangements or
relationships) in which Terminix (including any of
our subsidiaries) were, are or will be a participant

Rentokil Initial provides hygiene services to business environments to make them cleaner, safer, healthier
and more pleasant places in which to operate. Establishing good hygiene practices throughout an
and more pleasant places in which to operate. Establishing good hygiene practices throughout an
organization reduces the risk of infection being passed from person to person. As a result, fewer days are
lost to sickness, which translates directly into real cost savings and increased productivity. Rentokil Initial
offers a wide range of washroom hygiene services, including the provision and maintenance of products
such as air fresheners, sanitizers, feminine hygiene units, hand dryers, paper and linen towel dispensers,
soap dispensers, toilet paper dispensers and floor protection mats. The Hygiene & Wellbeing segment also
includes three additional services: Ambius, Dental Services and Cleanroom Services. Ambius operates in 17
countries and its product offering is broadly consistent across the world and includes interior landscaping,
Christmas decorations and premium scenting. The Dental Services business specializes in the professional
and compliant disposal and recycling of dental waste and provides waste separating products to customers
in Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, the U.S. and Switzerland. The Cleanroom Services business offers a
specialist cleanroom service, such as clothing rental and laundering, which includes a pickup and delivery
238 TABLE OF CONTENTS
service, implementation, contamination control (wet, dry and particle monitoring), client specific
decontamination, textile-care and sterilization, for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors in Europe.
The core offer in Rentokil Initial’s former Hygiene business had been based around the provision of regular
washroom services to customer premises. It had grown the business through broad-based operational
improvements in product range, density (product penetration and postcode density), service quality,
productivity, innovation, digital applications and products, sales capability and highly targeted M&A. As
customers and colleagues return to hospitality venues and offices, Rentokil Initial is seeking to expand its
business from beyond the washroom into new, higher-growth areas inside premises and the wider
environment.
The Hygiene & Wellbeing segment also serves all customer groups and, depending on individual market,
Rentokil Initial uses a mixture of digital marketing strategies (such as Search Engine Optimization, Pay-Per-
Click marketing, social media marketing, content marketing, email marketing and webinars), direct response
television advertising, direct mail and telemarketing. Rentokil Initial also markets its services and products
by participating in various industry conferences and events and providing sponsorships.
Services and Products
Services. Rentokil Initial’s Hygiene & Wellbeing segment offers a range of services both “inside” and
“outside” the washroom. Rentokil Initial’s hygiene technicians provide a wide range of services to meet the
enhanced expectations for hygiene, involving the following services: core washroom hygiene services by
using its scale service expertise and innovations; premises hygiene services by leveraging its expertise
outside the washroom such as specialist hygiene services in air care and clinical waste management; and
enhanced environment services by improving the occupant experience with premium scenting, plants, air
monitoring and green walls.
Products. Rentokil Initial’s Hygiene & Wellbeing products for inside the washroom provide a range of
innovative products for creating safer washrooms, including hand hygiene (soaps and driers), air care
(purification and scenting), in-cubicle (feminine hygiene units), no-touch products and digital hygiene
services. Outside the washroom, Rentokil Initial provides primarily hand hygiene products and air care
products.
“Inside” the Washroom. Washrooms are potentially higher risk areas for COVID-19 and other viruses, and
no-touch washrooms are the most effective way to avoid cross-contamination, particularly within cubicle
settings. For example, toilet paper dispensers that seal away paper until use, no-touch feminine hygiene
units and toilet seat cleaners prevent cross-contamination. Rentokil Initial’s Signature Range of washroom
products have antimicrobial surfaces which helps reduce cross-contamination, as do its “no touch” auto-lift
lids on bins and auto dispense of paper towels and soaps. Air care quality is also an important indicator of
washroom cleanliness, with air purification units providing an ongoing method of removing potentially
harmful pathogens from the air. The greater awareness of in-cubicle and washroom hygiene is providing
more opportunities for new products and services for inside washrooms. Rentokil Initial expects to launch a
new Rapid>Smarthygiene high-end range of washroom solutions in 2022, which uses sensor technology to
collect key statistics that can be analyzed to reveal usage patterns and trends relating to user behaviors. The
Rapid>Smarthygiene solutions include Rapid>Foam (designed to optimize soap dosage for high-traffic
environments), Rapid>Water (designed to reduce water consumption), Rapid>Flush (designed to provide
odor control and reduced lime scale build up and bacteria growth by injecting a consistent amount of a
fragranced chemical into every flush) and Rapid>Lights (designed to indicate cubicle occupancy to reduce
unnecessary queues).
“Outside” the Washroom. The COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for hand hygiene, and Rentokil Initial
is developing service innovations to satisfy long-term social behavior change with a range of new solutions
which include new hand hygiene products that enable positioning outside the washroom, new consumables
for hand and surface, and larger-capacity soap and sanitizer dispensers. In addition, Rentokil Initial is
developing service solutions to provide to new target customer sectors, such as food processing and
healthcare, which require specific hardware and consumables to comply with higher hygiene standards. With
respect to air care, Rentokil Initial’s current air care product range features air purification, air sterilization
and air scenting products, and in 2020 it launched two important air filtration products: VIRUSKILLER
 and
Inspire Air72 Air Purifier. When independently tested against Coronavirus DF2 (a surrogate for
Coronavirus), Adenovirus, Influenza and Polio, VIRUSKILLER
 was found to kill

99.9999% of viruses on a single air pass. VIRUSKILLER
 is also sold to a range of customers including car
showrooms, hotels, offices, venues and UK embassies. Rentokil Initial was appointed Specialist Hygiene
Services Partner of London’s O2 arena, with the installation of VIRUSKILLER
 central to the appointment,
and it successfully installed the units in time for the 2021 BRIT Awards. In addition, Rentokil Initial’s air
purifier, InspireAir 72, helps improve indoor air quality to create a safer and more hygienic environment for
homes and businesses, including offices, learning centers, hotels, retail spaces and health care facilities.
InspireAir 72 is equipped with a high-efficiency particulate arrestance grade H14 filter that removes 99.92%
of airborne particles. As of December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial has installed over 13,800 air purification units
into customer sites across 41 countries.
Manufacturing / Supply Chain. The hardware products used in the Hygiene and Wellbeing business are
manufactured to a proprietary design by suppliers in Europe, Asia and the U.S. The highest volume products
include feminine hygiene bins, soap dispensers and paper dispensers for toilet tissue and hand towels. The
consumables for these dispensers are mainly purchased locally due to the cost and environmental impact of
shipping high-volume low-value products. Rentokil Initial has two manufacturing sites in the UK which
manufacture hardware and consumables, mainly for the UK and European markets. Products are managed by
a central supply chain team, either directly from supplier to market where volumes allow or via a central
warehouse in Antwerp, Belgium.
Market Opportunity
It is difficult to estimate the total market size for hygiene and wellbeing as the services and products in this
market are fragmented. The global hygiene and wellbeing industry comprises hygiene service providers,
consumables suppliers (such as the supply of paper and soap) and total facilities management operators
who provide various services including hygiene. However, there are segments of the hygiene and wellbeing
market that have more clearly outlined values, including: (i) the global smart washrooms market, which is
estimated to be approximately $6.9 billion by 2026, with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 15.7%
from 2020 to 2026 (KBV Research, “Global Smart Bathroom Market Analysis (2020 - 2026)” August 2020); (ii)
the global air care market, which is estimated to reach over $19 billion by 2026 and is expected to deliver a
12% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2026 (Arizton, “Air Purifier Market - Global Outlook and
Forecast 2021 - 2026” June 2021); and (iii) the global corporate wellness market, which was valued at $52.8
billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 7.0% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2028 to a value
of $93.4 billion (Grand View Research, “Corporate Wellnes Market Size & Share Report, 2021 - 2028”).
Hygiene is an essential, non-discretionary service protecting public health, and Rentokil Initial believes its
medium-term opportunities are enhanced by rising demand for global hygiene driven by population growth,
growth in air purification and hand sanitizer markets, rise of the millennial generation population that is
highly focused on health and wellbeing, urbanization, increasing legislation driving improved hygiene
standards and a rising global middle class with increasing hygiene standards and growing health
consciousness.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought what Rentokil Initial believes will be a longer-term change in attitudes
towards the importance and perception of health, hygiene and wellbeing, and hygiene has moved from being
viewed as a basic commodity to an essential service. First, customers seek greater assurance from service
providers with brand strength during this unprecedented period of uncertainty and conflicting information.
Rentokil Initial is a market leader and one of the most recognized and trusted brands, and Rentokil Initial
believes that such brand recognition will further strengthen its position in the global hygiene and wellbeing
market. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to sensitivity around microbe transmission points and
surfaces being carriers of risk. This has led to wide-scale surface disinfection and significantly enhanced
cleaning regimes and protocols. Third, the speed of onset and global spread of COVID-19 has led to
significant local government and agency responses, along with rapidly evolving and enhanced guidelines. In
addition, increased sensitivities around air filtering, air purification and air quality monitoring driven by
stricter regulations and standards are presenting significant new opportunities for air hygiene services and
products offered by Rentokil Initial.

culture, offering the best product ranges and delivering Rentokil Initial’s services on time and in full.
Margins are driven through postcode density (the number of customers on a route), product density (the
number of products/service lines in each customer premise), shared overheads with the Pest Control
segment (infrastructure and back office) and M&A (building further geographic density). Analysis of
Rentokil Initial’s current footprint supported by the right sales incentives and selling methods will drive
behaviors that will lead to improved density.
Offer a complete product range to avoid cross-infection inside the washroom. Washrooms are high-risk areas for
viruses; they are small spaces, with smooth surfaces and high levels of traffic. The greater awareness of
cubicle and washroom hygiene is providing more opportunities for new products and services for inside
washrooms. A range of innovative products for creating safer washrooms include hand hygiene (soaps and
driers), air care (purification and scenting), in-cubicle (feminine hygiene units), no-touch products and digital
hygiene services.
Expanding outside the washroom. Outside the washroom, high-growth areas include air care, air enhancement
and purification, sustainable waste management (such as medical waste removal), products and expertise to
enhance public spaces and buildings, route-based service extensions (such as first aid) and digital products
and applications. Rentokil Initial provides products in multiple environments, such as offices, kitchens and
reception areas, leveraging its hygiene expertise into air purification, disinfection, mats, hand sanitizers and
dispensers and surface hygiene. Air care is a particular focus for Rentokil Initial. There is no safe level of
airborne pollutants and, according to the World Health Organization, 68% of all diseases are related to air
pollution. About a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence began to show that COVID-19 is transmitted
predominantly through the air by people talking and breathing out large droplets and small particles called
aerosols. Therefore, efforts have increased across the globe to prevent transmission by improving
ventilation or installing rigorously tested air purifiers.
Harness the digital opportunity, developing digital innovations to address customer needs and increase productivity.
Rentokil Initial continues to develop digital products for enhanced services combined with greater reporting
and insight. Rentokil Initial believes the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a springboard for increased digital
hygiene services and is taking its digital expertise from its Pest Control business and expanding into its
Hygiene & Wellbeing business. In 2020, Rentokil Initial launched its first range of digital no-touch products,
which includes taps, soap dispensers, hand wash monitoring and cubicle sanitizers. Digital monitoring of
consumables enables more efficient washroom operations at a lower cost, with a reduced environmental
impact and offering a better guest experience. Rentokil Initial is expanding its Rapid Smart Hygiene range
into new customers and regions, with customer trials currently under way in offices, retail malls, airports,
leisure facilities and tourist attractions across five countries.
Rentokil Initial’s digital sales and service tools are also increasing productivity and are being used to build
customer awareness of its multiple product offerings. Rentokil Initial’s online Hygiene customer portal,
myInitial, is being developed to highlight the full spectrum of Hygiene & Wellbeing solutions on its home
page and is used by over 100,000 customers in 18 countries. The myInitial reporting platform provides
transparency of service, including signature capture, service history and details, dates of visits and
reporting facilities. In addition, Rentokil Initial’s colleagues use the smartphone field service application,
ServiceTrak, to record start time, services performed, customer recommendations, customer signatures and
end time. ServiceTrak is designed to help automate, accelerate and digitize service documentation so that
Rentokil Initial’s customers do not receive paper-based service reports, thereby enhancing customer
experience while promoting communication and process efficiency. Across 33 countries, Rentokil Initial
technicians used ServiceTrak to record 7.3 million service visits and detailed information.
Geographic expansion through organic actions. Rentokil Initial’s core Hygiene services currently operate in 67
countries and it aims to increase the reach and density of its footprint in new markets through leveraging its
brand and expertise, starting with core hygiene service provision “Inside the Washroom,” and then
extending into premises hygiene and enhanced environments. Rentokil Initial’s strategy is to expand in five
key areas: North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, by building on its existing
customer relationships and routes in the Pest Control business and targeting North America, and using its
existing Ambius and Pest Control businesses.

In addition, Rentokil Initial has a management team of highly experienced leaders across all countries where
it operates, many of whom have been with Rentokil Initial for over 10 years. The members of Rentokil Initial’s
management team have strong and proven capabilities, and possess deep knowledge of the industries and
markets within which they work, as well as leverage technology to innovate and grow the business. Rentokil
Initial’s compensation structure is tied to key performance metrics that are designed to incentivize senior
management to drive the long-term success of its business. Rentokil Initial believes its management team has
the dedication and experience to position the business for continued success and to implement and execute
its business strategies at pace, as well as over the long term.
Rentokil Initial’s highest priority is ensuring everyone goes home safely at the end of the working day.
Health and safety is the first item on the agenda at every management meeting including the Executive
Leadership Team and Board meetings. Over the past seven years Rentokil Initial’s safety performance has
improved consistently, with its Lost Time Accident (“LTA”) rate improving from 2.06 in 2008 to 0.38 in 2021,
the lowest LTA rate ever achieved. Listening to colleagues’ opinions has been a bedrock of Rentokil Initial’s
culture. In 2021, Rentokil Initial undertook Your Voice Counts, a global, confidential survey providing every
colleague with the opportunity to give feedback on workplace culture, leadership, customer focus,
development and line manager performance. With a record high response rate of 91%, Rentokil Initial
maintained high levels of colleague engagement (80%) and colleague enablement (83%), and 25 questions
saw improvements in their scores over pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Strong improvements were made with
colleagues feeling informed about news concerning Rentokil Initial and its overall strategic direction. In
particular, scores for equal opportunities came in 10% higher than the global high-performance norm of
leading companies.
Rentokil Initial is a diverse organization by its nature, operating in 88 countries and across 40 languages.
Rentokil Initial has strived, and will continue to strive, to ensure that its local businesses reflect the
countries, markets and communities in which they operate and to create an environment where everyone’s
view is heard, everyone’s contribution matters and everyone has equal opportunities to succeed. Rentokil
Initial’s new workplace strategy through to 2024 places even greater emphasis on wider diversity where
everyone, regardless of gender identity, race, color, nationality, age, sexual orientation, physical ability or
background, can reach the highest levels based on merit. In support of this strategy, in 2021 Rentokil Initial
deployed a global diversity, equality and inclusion upskilling initiative to managers and leaders. The program
featured two elements: “Include,” where sessions focused on how to foster an inclusive environment, and
“Decide,” which focused on bias and how to mitigate it. In 2021, approximately 1,000 managers and leaders
participated in this program, with highly positive feedback. In June 2021, Rentokil Initial reviewed and
updated its Group Diversity, Inclusion & Equality Policy to further strengthen its focus on equality. This
policy is published internally on the Rentokil Initial intranet and externally on its corporate website.
In 2021, Rentokil Initial’s U+ courses were viewed 4.3 million times (compared to 3.2 million in 2020, a 34%
increase), and more than 500 new pieces of learning content, including videos and courses, were created by
an in-house content development team. This equates to an average of 107 content views per colleague
throughout 2021, up from 79 views per colleague in 2020 (an increase of 26%) with each colleague completing
a U+ training course on average every two working days during 2021. During 2021 Rentokil Initial has
continued to provide employment and development opportunities to young people, employing over 350
apprentices and over 330 graduates across its UK business. It also took part in the UK government’s
Kickstart Scheme aimed at people aged between 16 and 24 who are claiming Universal Credit and are at risk
for long-term unemployment.
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic creating many challenges for Rentokil Initial’s colleagues and
their families, in 2020 it established a Colleague Support Fund of approximately £450,000 to aid those within
Rentokil Initial in countries where government support schemes were insufficient for the severe difficulties
they faced. This was created using funds from RI Cares, together with a voluntary salary waiver by the Chief
Executive Officer of 65% of his salary for the second quarter of 2020 (having already waived 35% as part of

Beginning in 2020, Rentokil Initial developed a business-wide operational approach to environmental
sustainability. In 2021, Rentokil Initial began to execute its new plan, which involved a commitment to
achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from its operations by the end of 2040.
This ambitious goal is fully aligned with Rentokil Initial’s business plan and operations, has clear
deliverables and is one of the ways in which it seeks to deliver with impact its social purpose of protecting
people and enhancing lives. Rentokil Initial believes that its goal to be at net zero emissions from its
operations by the end of 2040 is bold, given it operates in 88 countries, including many emerging markets.
However, Rentokil Initial has a proven record of meeting such targets in the past: over the past 10 years, it
has met its targets for 10% reduction in its emissions intensity index (2011 - 2015) and a further 20%
reduction in its emissions intensity index (2016 - 2019). Rentokil Initial also believes it will unlock a new level
of energy and innovation as it seeks to establish itself as the leader in environmental sustainability in its
industry. Rentokil Initial’s pathway to net zero by the end of 2040 includes a number of milestones along the
way. Key elements of its plan include the transition to a low-emission fleet, the reduction in its energy
emissions through the transition to renewable property electricity, and reduction in emissions from the use
of chemicals, each of which are under way, and are detailed below.
Transitioning to an Ultra-Low Emissions Fleet
The implementation of Rentokil Initial’s strategy to transition its current fleet of internal combustion engine
vehicles to ultra-low emission vehicles (“ULEVs”) is gaining momentum. Rentokil Initial now has a range of
ULEVs across its fleet including electric vehicles (“EVs”), plugin hybrid EVs, non-plug-in hybrids, e-
motorbikes, hybrid motorbikes and e-trikes. 157 ULEVs were delivered in 2021, with Rentokil Initial’s
businesses in Europe and the UK leading the way. One of Rentokil Initial’s key transitional risks is access to
suitable low emission vehicles. Battery electric vehicles remain its primary focus, secondly, plug-in hybrids
and then, where technology is not readily available or not yet cost-effective, non-plug-in hybrid products
will be used to reduce Rentokil Initial’s vehicle-related carbon dioxide emissions. Rentokil Initial has also
considered the reputational transitional risk of not having a more sustainable fleet. Although the EV market
has good product coverage for cars, and increasingly small vans, Rentokil Initial anticipates from 2023 larger
electric battery vans will have better capability and it is also looking at hydrogen vehicles as an alternative,
as they become viable. In 2021, Rentokil Initial also commenced a pilot of natural gas vehicles, giving it
further options for ULEV fleet vehicles. In addition to Rentokil Initial’s transition to ULEVs, it has a number
of regional initiatives to implement telematics on its vehicles, delivering major benefits in reducing vehicle
emissions, driver behavior and route management. Rentokil Initial has also completed implementation of
“Solight” boxes on trucks, which provide a 15% weight reduction.
Renewable Electricity for Rentokil Initial’s Properties
Rentokil Initial’s approach to reducing its emissions from purchased electricity is to introduce green energy
or renewable tariffs for its owned buildings, with the focus on its top 20 countries (accounting for over 85%
of its global electricity consumption). Three of these operations have already begun to transition. Italy is
Rentokil Initial’s first country operation to be 100% renewable. In Australia, its main Sydney and Melbourne
branches use fully renewable electricity, and its operation in the UK is at over 90% renewable electricity. In
countries where renewable opportunities are extremely limited, due to energy supply arrangements and/or
cost, Rentokil Initial’s short-term focus is on reducing energy consumption through on-site options such as
solar.
As well as focusing on energy efficiency at Rentokil Initial’s larger facilities, it is also prioritizing energy
savings that it can make at a local level. These include installation of LED lighting in branches and
warehouses, and new systems to switch off lights, heating and air conditioning, with motion-sensors to
switch off automatically. Rentokil Initial’s immediate target is to have five to ten major markets use 100%
renewable electricity by 2025 and it currently estimates transitioning around 90% of properties by 2030.

environment, the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances
and wastes, the impact of chemicals, as well as pesticide and biocide products, on human health and safety
and the environment, and the protection of the health and safety of Rentokil Initial’s colleagues. These laws
also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and
past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites Rentokil
Initial currently owns or operates. These laws and regulations can result in costs associated with
transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines, penalties,
orders requiring corrective action or suspending or otherwise impacting Rentokil Initial’s operations or other
sanctions if it is found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of
certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Changes in such laws
and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales
of some of Rentokil Initial’s products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and
delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions
to Rentokil Initial’s business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should it be unable to
meet the demands of its customers for products or services. Environmental and regulatory matters most
significant to Rentokil Initial’s operations are discussed below.
Pesticide and Biocide Legislation. Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations
govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. Rentokil Initial provides services utilizing certain
disinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria,
viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such
products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of
1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides.
Rentokil Initial maintains product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).
Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay
ongoing registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and
payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by
FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and
California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state.
In Europe, the Biocidal Products Regulation (“BPR”) establishes a program to evaluate and authorize
marketing of biocidal active substances and products. BPR requires the use of only approved biocides in
Rentokil Initial’s products imported to or used in the European Union. Compliance with these regulations
(and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere, such as the United Kingdom, Australia,
China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, and other countries) may require registration, notification, or certification
regarding regulated substances, imposition of import restrictions, or in certain cases the redesign or
reformulation of Rentokil Initial’s products.
In addition, some of Rentokil Initial’s operations involve the application of restricted-use pesticides that it
generally purchases from third parties. Those operations must comply with certain standards pertaining to
the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of colleagues who apply such pesticides. Such regulations
are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations.
U.S. Federal and State Chemicals Regulations. The primary chemicals management law in the United States, the
Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the
Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (“LCSA”) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the
original 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in
commerce, improve the EPA capability and authority to regulate existing and new
246 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
chemical substances, and prevent further state action or other notification programs like REACH (see below).
The TSCA changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the United
States. In addition, the EPA likely will be more aggressively using the existing TSCA tools to manage
chemicals of concern. Certain states have their own chemical regulations, such as California’s Proposition 65,
which requires businesses to provide warnings to California residents about significant risk of exposures to
chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.
REACH. The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and
Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”), which aims to manage chemical safety risks. REACH established a
European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine
hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe.
In addition, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements.
GHS. In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical
products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (“GHS”).
GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals
through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates
information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (“SDSs”). Most
countries in which Rentokil Initial operates adopted GHS-related legislation by 2021. The primary cost of
compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels.
FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements. Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state,
local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured, used and sold by Rentokil Initial for
controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements
generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). However, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to
food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety
and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including
proposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional
requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the
FDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional
requirements related to safety product lines.
Other Environmental Legislation. Rentokil Initial is subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws
and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the
transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary U.S. federal statutes that apply to
Rentokil Initial’s activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. It is also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air,
land and water. Under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
of 1980, and analogous state statutes, Rentokil Initial could be liable for contamination at current or former
owned, leased or operated properties or at sites to which it sent wastes for disposal. Liability under these
statutes can be imposed on a joint and several basis and without regard to fault or the legality of the
underlying conduct.
Rentokil Initial cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental laws on its operations. Changes in,
or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously
unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may
lead to additional compliance or other costs.
Data Privacy
Rentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and
standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. In
the U.S., Rentokil Initial is, or may become, subject to numerous federal, state and local data privacy and
security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security,
transfer, storage and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws,
data breach notification laws, and data disposal laws. The U.S. Congress also has considered, and may in

Overview
Rentokil Initial is a global leader in the provision of route-based services which protect people and enhance
lives. Incorporated as Rentokil Limited in 1926 in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock
Exchange market in 1969, Rentokil Initial now has a global reach, with approximately 46,000 colleagues and
operations in 88 countries around the world, in more than 90 of the world’s 100 leading cities. In 1996,
Rentokil Limited acquired British Electric Traction and the “Initial” brand to become Rentokil Initial. Rentokil
Initial’s purpose is to protect people from the dangers of pest-borne disease and the risks of poor hygiene
and to enhance lives with services that protect the health and wellbeing of people and the reputation of its
customers’ brands. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial recorded revenue of £2,956.6
million and operating profit of £346.5 million.
As of January 1, 2022 Rentokil Initial made changes to the regional operating segments, designed to provide
clearer geographic links and to align growth strategies, as follows:
North America: Puerto Rico joined the Latin America region
Europe: Includes Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Poland), previously in UK & Rest
of World region
UK & Sub-Saharan Africa: No change to UK, Ireland & Baltics. Sub-Saharan Africa remained in this
region. Other Rest of World countries (MENAT and Caribbean) moved to other regions
Asia & MENAT: Enlarged region includes Asia and MENAT countries
Latin America: Includes Caribbean (formerly in UK & Rest of World) and Puerto Rico (formerly in
North America)
Pacific: No change
Rentokil Initial historically had operated three business segments: Pest Control, Hygiene and Protect &
Enhance. However, in response to the rising importance of hygiene and wellbeing services, as of January 1,
2022 Rentokil Initial reorganized its business segments, primarily expanding the former Hygiene segment to
become Hygiene & Wellbeing and reclassifying the businesses in its former Protect & Enhance segment,
effective as of January 1, 2022. The Protect & Enhance segment had included five businesses: Ambius,
Property Care, Dental Services, Cleanroom Services and Workwear (France). The Ambius, Dental Services
and Cleanroom Services businesses have been added to the enlarged segment, now called Hygiene &
Wellbeing, the Property Care business has been added to the Pest Control segment and Workwear (France)
has been left as a stand-alone segment.
The segment financial information presented reflects these reclassifications to conform the presentation in
the relevant periods to the revised operating segment structure.
Accordingly, as of January 1, 2022, Rentokil Initial operates three business segments: Pest Control, Hygiene
& Wellbeing and Workwear (France). However, Rentokil Initial considers Pest Control and Hygiene &
Wellbeing to be its core business segments. The Pest Control business, which operates in 87 countries, is
the world’s leading international commercial pest control service provider, offering high levels of risk
management, reassurance and responsiveness to customers. The Hygiene & Wellbeing business, which
operates in 67 countries, offers a wide range of services to meet today’s rising expectations for
249 •

• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
hygiene, including core washroom services, specialist services in air care and clinical-waste management,
and environment-enhancing services, including scenting, plants and air monitoring. The Workwear (France)
business specializes primarily in the supply and laundering of workwear, uniforms, cleanroom garments and
personal protective wear in France.
Pest Control. Rentokil Initial’s pest control specialists protect people and enhance lives by providing
pest control solutions that ensure public health and protect the environment through energy efficient
and sustainable pest control services. Rentokil Initial offers a complete range of pest control services
and solutions for commercial and residential properties, from common pests such as rodents, flies,
stored product insects, biting insects and birds to other kinds of wildlife. Additionally, Rentokil Initial
offers property care services such as dry rot and woodworm treatment and damp proofing, as well as
a brand standards service (“Brand Standards”), which provides food safety and operational
assessments to enhance customer experience and the provision of effective “Do-It-Yourself”
products to enable customers to eliminate small pest problems within their home. Rentokil Initial has
extensive experience across a wide range of industries and uses both preventative and responsive
strategies to enhance protection for its customers through holistic, integrated pest management
programs.
Hygiene & Wellbeing. Rentokil Initial provides hygiene services to business environments to make
them cleaner, safer, healthier and more pleasant places in which to operate. Establishing good
hygiene practices throughout an organization reduces the risk of infection being passed from person
to person. As a result, fewer days are lost to sickness, which translates directly into real cost savings
and increased productivity. Rentokil Initial offers a wide range of washroom hygiene services,
including the provision and maintenance of products such as air fresheners, sanitizers, feminine
hygiene units, hand dryers, paper and linen towel dispensers, soap dispensers, toilet paper
dispensers and floor protection mats. Additionally, Rentokil Initial offers specialist hygiene services,
from the deep cleaning of commercial kitchens, washrooms and hospitals, to industrial, high-level
cleaning and drains maintenance, as well as medical services, a healthcare waste management service
to healthcare practices, including medical waste segregation, storage and disposal (the “Specialists
Hygiene, Medical and Products”). The Hygiene & Wellbeing segment also includes three additional
services: Ambius, Dental Services and Cleanroom Services. Ambius operates in 16 countries and its
product offering is broadly consistent across the world and includes interior landscaping, Christmas
decorations and premium scenting. The Dental Services business specializes in the professional and
compliant disposal and recycling of dental waste and provides waste separating products to
customers in Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, the U.S., the UK and Switzerland. Cleanroom Services
business offers a specialist cleanroom service, such as clothing rental and laundering, which includes
a pickup and delivery service, implementation, contamination control (wet, dry and particle
monitoring), client specific decontamination, textile-care and sterilization, for the pharmaceutical and
healthcare sectors in Europe.
Workwear (France). Rentokil Initial’s Workwear (France) segment specializes primarily in the supply
and laundering of workwear, uniforms, cleanroom garments and personal protective wear in France.
Rentokil Initial’s strategy in Workwear (France) is aimed at creating a business that has a clear market
differentiation through the highest level of product and service quality by focusing on rigorous
application of key performance indicators to measure quality of service, using radio-frequency and
identity tags to improve service accountability, utilizing highest standards in washing and repair
quality (including quality of detergents), being responsive to customer needs, dedicating a separate
team to focus on innovation of services and products and leveraging existing supply chain, research
and development, processing, sales and marketing from the Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing
segments.
The Impact of COVID-19 and Macro-economic Factors on Rentokil Initial’s Business
COVID-19
In 2020 and 2021, Rentokil Initial’s operations and financial performance have been impacted by the COVID-
19 pandemic. During this time, Rentokil Initial experienced disruptions in its business, primarily in offices and
the hospitality and food service industries in the Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing
250 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
segments, driven by temporary business closures and service postponements. In particular, from mid-March
to end of April 2020, Rentokil Initial faced the most severe disruptions resulting from local, regional and
country lock-downs designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. One of Rentokil Initial’s first actions as
the crisis deepened was to ensure that its key services qualified as “essential” to ensure its technicians
could continue to serve customers, including supermarkets, hospitals, food producers and pharmaceuticals.
Rentokil Initial also trained and equipped more than 6,000 technicians to carry out disinfection services.
Beginning in July 2020, Rentokil Initial experienced a return to growth in the Pest Control segment as lock-
downs subsided and high demand in the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment for disinfection services continued.
Over the course of 2021, Rentokil Initial’s Pest Control segment experienced growth in its residential pest
control portfolio, aided by the work-from-home business environment, and its commercial pest control
portfolio grew as the lock-down conditions generally eased around the world, resulting in the offices
reopening and the hospitality and food service industries resuming service. Rentokil Initial’s Hygiene
segment experienced a decrease in demand in the first half of 2021 as customer requirements for emergency
disinfection services significantly decreased. In addition, Rentokil Initial has experienced, to a limited extent,
many of the macro-economic factors felt by other companies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including
but not limited to, labor shortages, higher costs of PPE and products and labor due to lack of availability and
adverse impacts on ability to service customers in a timely fashion. Rentokil expects limited impacts from
COVID-19 to continue in the short term.
Overall, considering the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic,
Rentokil Initial’s ability to predict the impact of COVID-19 on its business in future periods remains limited.
The effects of the pandemic on its business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in its financial
results, until future periods. The ultimate societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also
remains unknown. In particular, Rentokil Initial cannot predict whether any worsening or continuation of the
COVID-19 pandemic, or any resulting economic impact, will adversely affect its business.
Other Macro-economic factors
Inflation. Rentokil Initial’s cost base is largely driven by the cost of compensation for colleagues and the
costs of required equipment (including service equipment and uniforms, vehicles and fuel and technology
necessary to deliver the high quality services) and the cost of the products being used on the customer
premises including rental equipment and consumables. All of these costs are subject to inflationary
pressures and as such, sustained elevated increases in such costs may not always be possible to pass on to
customers. Over the period from 2019 to 2021, inflationary pressures were typically low in the countries in
which Rentokil Initial operated and therefore passing these costs on to customers has been achievable. In
contrast, Rentokil Initial also has operations in Lebanon, a hyperinflationary country. The business in
Lebanon implements frequent price increases to offset the increases in cost it incurs. This demonstrates that
Rentokil Initial has operations in both low and high inflationary markets and is accustomed to a range of
inflationary environments.
As a result of the invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, inflation levels globally have risen to their
highest in two decades, particularly impacting fuel prices, timber prices, energy prices and labor costs.
During the first half of 2022, Rentokil Initial has been able to pass along the incurred inflationary impacts in
the form of increased prices to its customers and expects to do so for the remainder of 2022. However,
Rentokil Initial cannot predict the extent to which it may experience future cost increases. Rentokil Initial may
be prevented, in whole or in part, from passing these cost increases on to its existing and prospective
customers, which could have a material adverse impact on Rentokil Initial’s business.
Shortage of products or supply chain impacts. Rentokil Initial does not have significant exposure to
international logistics as the majority of its purchased products and services are sourced in the country they
are consumed. Where there are local shortages, products are typically able to be imported quickly from
neighboring markets. Where global shortages exist, such as recent microchip shortages impacting IT and
vehicle supply chains, Rentokil Initial has been able to generally extend the life of the asset until supply
chains catch up. However, should there be long term shortages of critical products or services in the future,
then this may adversely impact the operational performance of Rentokil Initial.
Labor shortages. The goods and services of Rentokil Initial are sold by front line sales colleagues and
delivered by a highly skilled technician workforce. These colleagues are supported by functional support
251 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
colleagues in Rentokil Initial’s offices around the world. Rentokil Initial typically retains around 85% of
colleagues each year, although this can vary from year to year and by market. As a result of colleagues
leaving each year and the need to replace and hire additional colleagues for growth, Rentokil Initial has
established experienced recruitment teams and processes allowing access to many different labor market
places. Rentokil Initial has a very strong recruitment brand and offers attractive remuneration packages and
career development opportunities. During the first half of 2021, Rentokil Initial did experience a more elevated
number of resignations, in a limited number of localized geographies, following the decline in the COVID-19
pandemic around the world. This did not have a material impact on Rentokil Initial in 2021 or for the first half
of 2022. However, a very significant shortage of labor in a specific geography in the future may limit Rentokil
Initial’s ability to service revenue opportunities while finding qualified colleagues and adversely impact the
operational performance of Rentokil Initial.
Key Indicators of Performance and Financial Condition and Non-IFRS Alternative Performance Measures
Rentokil Initial focuses on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics, including certain
non-IFRS measures, to monitor the financial condition and performance of its business. These metrics
include Revenue, Operating Profit, Ongoing Revenue (at CER), Ongoing Operating Profit (at CER), Adjusted
Profit before Tax, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Organic Revenue Growth, Free Cash Flow
Conversion, Customer Retention, Colleague Retention and Lost Time Accident Rate.
Revenue. Revenue results are primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services and products
provided to Rentokil Initial’s customers by the business, as well as the mix of services and products
provided across the business. The volume of revenue is impacted by new unit sales, the retention of existing
customers and acquisitions. Rentokil Initial serves both residential and commercial customers. During 2021,
sales were generated across 88 countries, with the only countries accounting for equal to or greater than
10% of revenue from external customers being the U.S. (42%) and France (10%).
Operating Profit. This measure is calculated as Revenue less Operating Expenses, with Operating Expenses
consisting of employee costs, direct materials and services, vehicle costs, property costs, depreciation and
impairment of property, plant and equipment, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, one-off
items - operating and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include professional fees,
marketing costs, amortization of contract assets and movements in bad debt provision.
Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit (each at CER). These non-IFRS measures represent the
performance of the continuing operations of Rentokil Initial (including acquisitions) after removing the effect
of disposed or closed businesses. Ongoing measures enable Rentokil Initial’s management to focus on the
performance of the businesses retained and will therefore contribute to future performance. Ongoing
Operating Profit is an adjusted measure and is presented before the amortization and impairment of intangible
assets (excluding computer software), one-off items (see below) and gain or loss on disposal of businesses.
Given the international nature of Rentokil Initial’s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a
significant impact on the reported results of Rentokil Initial when they are translated into sterling (the
functional currency of Rentokil Initial). In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of
the business, revenue and profit measures are often presented at constant exchange rates (CER). CER is
calculated by translating current-year reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior
year. See “- Constant Exchange Rates (CER)” below.
Adjusted Profit before Tax. This non-IFRS measure is used to give management and investors an
understanding of the underlying profitability of the business over time. Adjusted Profit before Tax is
calculated by adding the following items back to Profit before Income Tax: amortization and impairment of
intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off items (operating and associates) and net interest
adjustments. Intangible assets (excluding computer software) are recognized on acquisition of businesses
which, by their nature, can vary by size and amount each year. As a result, amortization of intangibles is
added back to assist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow
comparability across regions and segments. One-off items are significant expenses or income that will have a
distortive impact on the underlying profitability of Rentokil Initial. Typical examples are costs related to the
acquisition of businesses (including aborted acquisitions), gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business,
material gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy property-related provisions
(environmental liabilities), and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes. Net interest adjustments
252 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are other non-cash accounting gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort
understanding of the performance of the business, such as net interest on pension schemes and interest fair
value adjustments. These adjustments are made to aid year on year comparability.
Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS metric that is measured as net cash from operating activities,
adjusted for cash flows related to the purchase and sale of property, plant, equipment and intangible fixed
assets, cash flows related to leased assets and dividends received from associates. These items are
considered by management to be non-discretionary, as continued investment in these assets is required to
support the day-to-day operations of the business. This measure is also used by management to assess how
much cash there is to reinvest into the business for future growth through people, technology and M&A.
Adjusted Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Adjusted Profit after Tax
attributable to equity holders of Rentokil Initial by the weighted average number of shares in issue during
the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust which are treated as cancelled,
and including share options for which all conditions have been met. Adjusted earnings per share is a non-
IFRS metric that is calculated as earnings per share adjusted for the after-tax effects of one-off items
(including the net gain on disposal of businesses), amortization and impairment of intangibles, and net
interest adjustments. This supplemental measure is also used by management to gain an understanding of
the underlying earnings per share performance of the business over time and enable company-to-company
comparisons.
Organic Revenue Growth. Organic Revenue Growth measures are non-IFRS metrics that are used to help
understand the underlying performance of Rentokil Initial. These supplemental measures are also used by
management to develop forecasts in tracking performance, serving as a key metric in certain of Rentokil
Initial’s compensation programs. Organic Revenue growth represents the growth in Ongoing Revenue (at
CER) excluding the effect of businesses acquired during the year. Acquired businesses are included in
organic measures in the year following acquisition, and the comparative period is adjusted to include an
estimated full year performance for growth calculations (pro forma revenue).
Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is measured as Free Cash
Flow adjusted for the cash impact of one-off items - operating and product development additions. This
measure is also used by management to determine the efficiency at which the business is able to convert
profits into cash. Free Cash Flow conversion is calculated by dividing Adjusted Free Cash Flow by Adjusted
Profit after Tax attributable to equity holders of the Company, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted Profit
after Tax attributable to equity holders of the Company is defined as Adjusted Profit before Tax adjusted for
the tax effect of amortization and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and one-off
items - operating and net interest adjustments.
Customer Retention. Customer Retention is used to track the retention of Rentokil Initial’s renewable
customers and is calculated on a rolling, 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies. Defined as
total portfolio value of customers retained as a percentage of opening portfolio. Rentokil Initial views
Customer Retention as one of the key indicators of the long term success of the business. Customer
Retention was 85.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2022, 85.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021,
84.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 86.2% in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Colleague Retention. Defined as total Sales and Service colleagues retained in year as a percentage of sales
and service headcount at start of the year. Rentokil Initial considers Colleague Retention to be a key driver
of Customer Retention. Colleague Retention was 84.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, 88.6% in the
year ended December 31, 2020 and 86.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of 4.2
percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
was a result of colleagues who joined the business at the height of the pandemic and employment
uncertainty in 2020, leaving Rentokil Initial in 2021 as other sectors recovered. In the six months ended June
30, 2022 Rentokil Initial maintained its colleague retention rate in the mid-eighties percent range, although
down by 1% on 2021, on a rolling 12-month basis.
Lost Time Accident Rate. Defined as the number of lost time accidents per 100,000 standard working hours.
Rentokil Initial views Lost Time Accident Rate as a key measure of Rentokil Initial’s colleagues’ injury
prevention. The rate was 0.38 in the six months ended June 30, 2022, 0.38 in the year ended December 31,
2021, 0.39 in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 0.53 in the year ended December 31, 2019.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain Components of Results of Operations
Profit before Income Tax. This is calculated as Revenue less Operating Expenses and net finance costs plus
share of profit from associated undertakings (net of tax).
Income Tax Expenses. The income tax expense for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Current
tax expense represents the amount payable on this year’s taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior
years. Taxable profits differ from accounting profits as some items of income or expenditure are not taxable or
deductible or may be taxable or deductible in a different accounting period. The current income tax charge is
calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the
countries where Rentokil Initial’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Deferred
tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences
between accounting and tax bases. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply when
the timing difference reverses based on tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date.
Profit for the Year. This measure is calculated as Profit before Income Tax less Income Tax Expenses.
For definitions of Revenue and Operating Profit (including Operating Expenses), see “- Key Indicators of
Performance and Financial Condition.”

result of the COVID-19 pandemic, when pay waivers were implemented across the board and all
senior management grades, with bonus schemes in the first half of 2020 cancelled and the 2020 long

December 31, 2021 from £583.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was a
result of the increase in sales of products and services partially offset by a non-repeat of the
increased costs of personal protective equipment of £25 million incurred in the year ended
December 31, 2020.
Vehicle costs
Vehicle costs increased by £12.5 million, or 9.3%, to £146.4 million in the year ended December 31,

properties used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment
Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment decreased by £3.9 million, or 2.9%,
to £128.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £132.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020 mainly as a result of the reduction in service contract equipment in use on
customer sites as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as revenues switched from disinfection
services which did not require rental assets to £517.7 million at December 31, 2021 from £523.5
million at December 31, 2020. This reduction in service contract equipment was due to reduction in
such equipment being used on customer sites as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as revenues
switched to disinfection services which did not require such equipment.
Amortization and impairment of intangible assets
Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased by £9.9 million, or 9.8%, to £91.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £101.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2020 mainly as a result of the non-repeat of goodwill impairments in India and Brazil of £8.1 million
and £2.5 million respectively in the year ended December 31, 2020.
One-off items - operating
One-off items - operating increased by £13.0 million, or 168.8%, to £20.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 from £7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of fees relating
to the Terminix transaction of £6.0 million, and the non-repeat of a non-cash credit of £7.3 million
relating to the closure of a pension scheme in North America in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Operating Profit
Operating profit increased by £52.7 million, or 17.9%, to £346.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021
from £293.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating profit was a result of the
increase in revenue of £153.3 million, or 5.5%, to £2,956.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£2,803.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of

countries and regions in which Rentokil Initial operates and the execution of its high service and innovation
and technology strategy, which drove customer retention and new sales of innovative new products to meet
evolving customer needs. Rentokil Initial believes such execution of Rentokil Initial’s business strategy
resulted in a 1.2% increase in net operating margins to 11.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021 from 10.5%
in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the return of the core service
provision allowed Rentokil Initial to fully resume its high-quality service model. As part of this resumption,
Rentokil Initial was able to catch up on service, debt and customer satisfaction issues that had arisen during
the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in the release of
£20.0 million of revenue provisions and £12.0 million of bad debt provisions taken in year ended December

described above, Rentokil Initial also incurred lower net finance costs of £29.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, a decrease of £42.8 million, or 59.2%, from £72.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2020 due to the non-recurrence of the £28.4 million cost of closing out an interest derivative linked to U.S.

Income tax expenses increased by £18.4 million, or 42.3%, to £61.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £43.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the margin improvements described

Operating Profit
Operating profit increased by £28.2 million, or 10.6%, to £293.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020
from £265.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in operating profit was a result of the
increase in revenue of £99.1 million, or 3.7%, to £2,803.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£2,704.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of

Operating profit was impacted in the year ended December 31, 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic related net

cancellation of bonus schemes in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020 and postponement of the
2020 long term incentive plan grant to the second half of the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as tight
control over discretionary spend. These savings, however, were offset by an increased bad debt provision of
£34.0 million, increased costs of personal protective equipment of £25.0 million (predominantly driven by the
need for comprehensive personal protective equipment when recording the provision for disinfection
services in the Hygiene segment) and increased restructuring costs of £5.5 million.
Profit before Income Tax
Profit before income tax decreased by £108.7 million, or 32.1%, to £229.8 million in the year ended December
31, 2020 from £338.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The main driver of the decrease was the net
gain on disposals of £103.8 million due to the disposal of the 17.8% interest in CWS-boco International
GmbH to Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income Tax Expenses
Income tax expenses decreased by £11.2 million, or 20.5%, to £43.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2020 from £54.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, Rentokil Initial was subject to an
effective tax rate of 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an effective tax rate of 16.2% in
the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax rate was driven by the profit on sale of businesses of
£103.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 being non-taxable.
Profit for the Year
Profit for the year decreased by £97.5 million, or 34.4%, to £186.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020
from £283.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profit was a result of the decrease
in profit before income tax of £108.7 million, or 32.1%, to £229.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020
from £338.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 partially offset by the decrease in income tax
expenses of £11.2 million, or 20.5%, to £43.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £54.7 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019.

Revenue for Six Months ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Six Months ended June 30, 2021
Pest Control
Revenue increased by £153.0 million, or 16.4%, to £1,086.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£933.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021, underpinned by the critical nature of pest control
services. Performance was supported by both pricing and volumes, led by the commercial pest control
business. Strength in the Pest Control category is notwithstanding some pockets of disruption that have
been impacted by supply chain limitations, protracted lockdown and other COVID-19-related constraints.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of £47.1 million and additional
revenue from 2022 M&A of £9.6 million and foreign exchange movements having a £37.4 million positive
effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pest Control revenue increased
organically by £58.9 million.
All revenue streams increased as the COVID-19 pandemic impact lessened with contract revenue growing by
£105.0 million to £706.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £601.2 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2021, job revenue increasing by £23.3 million to £235.5 million in the six months ended June
30, 2022 from £212.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and product revenue going up by £24.4
million to £150.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £126.4 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2021.
Hygiene & Wellbeing
Revenue decreased by £45.3 million, or 10.3%, to £392.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£437.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The 2020 rapid deployment of disinfection services
across 60 countries provided a hedge to lower revenues caused from disruption to core hygiene service
provision across the Group’s operations. Customers who used these services did so typically to remain open
during lockdowns. As expected, as the COVID-19 conditions significantly eased around the world, there was
a large reduction in customers’ need for these one-time services. Disinfection revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 reduced by £81.3 million to £13.8 million from £95.1 million in the six months ended June
30, 2021. Therefore the focus in 2022 was on protecting the existing customer base whilst targeting new
growth opportunities. A ramp up in activity across service sectors such as offices, shops, schools and
hospitality provided a tailwind to performance. Excluding the impact of disinfection revenue, revenues grew
by £36.0m, or 10.5%, in the six months to June 30, 2022 to £378.7 million from £342.7 million in the six months
to June 30, 2021.
France Workwear
Revenue increased by £10.1 million, or 12.6%, to £89.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£79.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Improving market conditions were reflected in the
stronger contribution from the France Workwear business, which overall was back to pre-COVID-19 levels. A
lag in recovery of the ‘as-used’ business in the Paris region (which was c.90% of 2019 levels in Hotels,
Restaurants and Catering ‘HORECA’) was balanced elsewhere including in regions where it had not
previously been established.

Revenue for the Year ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Pest Control
Revenue increased by £231.8 million, or 13.5%, to £1,953.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£1,721.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue was aided by an excellent performance from
the North America business, slightly offset by weaker performances from the Australia, New Zealand,
Malaysia and Indonesia operations, which were materially impacted by lock-downs in the second half of the
year ended December 31, 2021. Despite some labor shortages in such period, due to a number of colleagues
either off work due to COVID-19 or self-isolation, the Pest Control business in North America was the best
performing region. Property Care returned to organic growth with revenues returning to pre pandemic levels
as the UK commercial housing market strengthened.
The increase in revenue for this segment was aided by the incremental impact of 2020 M&A of £130.7 million
and additional revenue from 2021 M&A of £43.2 million but this was partly offset by foreign exchange
movements having a £86.5 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and
M&A, Pest Control revenue increased organically by £144.4 million.
All revenue streams increased as the COVID-19 pandemic impact lessened with contract revenue growing by
£128.1 million to £1,252.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £1,124.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, job revenue increasing by £41.4 million to £456.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £415.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and product revenue going up by £48.7 million
to £258.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £209.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2020. A reduction in credit notes to £10.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £18.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020 was the reason for £8.2 million of the revenue increase.
Hygiene & Wellbeing
Revenue decreased by £66.0 million, or 7.4%, to £829.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£895.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This reflected the anticipated tapering of disinfection
services, which was reduced by £108.8 million to £112.6 million. As with the Pest Control segment, however,
the operations in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Malaysia were held back by significant challenges
associated with ongoing lock-downs. The rapid deployment of disinfection services across 60 countries
enabled Rentokil Initial to generate £221.4 million of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Customers who used Rentokil Initial’s services (such as offices, shops, schools, airports, emergency
vehicles and public transport) did so typically to remain open during lock-down conditions. As lock-down
conditions generally eased around the world and Rentokil Initial’s core services returned, customer
requirements for emergency disinfection services significantly decreased, and therefore revenue from

disinfection services has tapered in line with management’s expectations. Dental Services and Cleanroom
Services returned to organic growth. The Ambius business returned to modest organic growth as the prior
year impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic unwound and customers started to purchase discretionary Ambius
products again.
France Workwear
Revenue decreased by £2.0 million, or 1.2%, to £165.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£167.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. In France, lock-downs began to ease in May 2021 with
fewer restrictions on restaurant operations, and as a result, Rentokil Initial saw an improving performance
from its Workwear business. While this improvement was encouraging, as-used volumes (where the
customer only pays for specific garments laundered) were still behind pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels,
impacted by ongoing temporary customer suspensions in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2021
and reduced tourism in France in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021.
Revenue for the Year ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Pest Control
Revenue decreased by £15.4 million, or 0.9%, to £1,721.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£1,737.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Pest Control segment was designated as an
essential service in the majority of Rentokil Initial’s markets and performed well in the year ended December
31, 2020. Performance has varied by geography and reflects the severity and duration of local, regional and
country lock-downs. Customer segments have been impacted differently by the COVID-19 pandemic. While
offices and the hospitality and food service industries were most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
therefore their demand for pest control services decreased, demand from others, including food retail,
pharmaceutical, transport and residential customers, increased. At the end of December 31, 2020, service
provision of 0.7% of the Pest Control customer premises remained suspended, compared to 7% at the peak of
the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. One-time job revenue was strong in the year ended December 31, 2020,
aided in part by warmer weather in the northern hemisphere and also by residential customers seeking swift
resolution to pest issues during lock-downs. The Property Care business also declined during the period by
16.1%, reflecting the continued weakness in the UK commercial housing market.
This revenue decrease was despite the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of £76.2 million and additional
revenue from 2020 M&A of £18.3 million but this was partly offset by foreign exchange movements having a
£25.8 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pest Control
revenue fell organically by £84.1 million.
Contract revenue increased by £60.2 million to £1,124.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£1,064.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 but this was offset by a decrease in job revenue of £35.8
million to £415.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £451.0 million in the year ended December
31, 2019 and product revenue of £22.5 million to £209.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£232.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted these revenue
streams as well as increasing the amount of credit notes by £12.6 million to £18.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020 from £5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Hygiene & Wellbeing
Revenue increased by £157.2 million, or 21.3%, to £895.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£738.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue growth in Hygiene & Wellbeing was driven by
£221.4 million of revenue from disinfection services launched rapidly across the world in the second quarter
of the year ended December 31, 2020. The revenue growth was offset as the core global Hygiene &
Wellbeing operations were more impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, principally due to the customers
(particularly those in the hospitality and food service industries) were forced to temporarily close their
operations, and therefore Rentokil Initial was unable to provide its services to such customers. Like in the
Pest Control segment, performance varied by geography and lock-down regime, and performance
improvements in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to an easing of lock-down
264 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
conditions in certain, but not all, countries. At the end of December 31, 2020, service provision of 4.4% of the
Hygiene & Wellbeing customer premises remained suspended compared to 22% at the peak of the COVID-19
pandemic in April 2020. The Ambius business declined during the period by 16.4%, reflecting the more
discretionary nature of Ambius products.
France Workwear
Revenue decreased by £18.4 million, or 9.9%, to £167.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£186.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The revenue decrease was principally due to disruption
in the hospitality and food services sector, delivering a revenue decline of 9.5% for the year ended December
31, 2020. At the end of December 31, 2020, service provision of 6% of the Workwear (France) customers
remained closed compared to 30% at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.

which increased by £61.5 million, or 13.3%, to £522.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£461.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 as a result of an increase in the number of colleagues
due to businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30,
2022. Direct materials and services increased by £20.4 million, or 11.6%, to £196.4 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022 from £176.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was as a result of

Operating expenses increased by £141.0 million, or 9.2%, to £1,676.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £1,535.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The main driver of this was employee costs
which increased by £90.1 million, or 10.5%, to £950.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £860.8
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in the number of colleagues due to
businesses acquired during the year and the cost saving measures taken in the year ended December 31,
2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, when pay waivers were implemented. Direct materials and
services increased by £43.2 million, or 14.0%, to £352.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£308.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was as a result of the increase in sales of
products and services partially offset by a non-repeat of the increased costs of personal protective
equipment in the year ended December 31, 2020. Vehicle costs increased by £13.8 million, or 16.6%, to £96.9
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £83.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, which
was a result of the increase in the number of colleagues due to businesses acquired during the year and
increased vehicle use following the reduced use due to lock-downs in the year ended December 31, 2020.
One-off items - operating increased by £9.2 million, or 3,066.7%, to £8.9 million in the year ended December

from £108.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly as a result of increases in the bad debt

Revenue for Six Months ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Six Months ended June 30, 2021
North America
Revenue increased by £56.2 million, or 8.8%, to £693.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£637.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This revenue increase was aided by the incremental
impact of 2021 M&A of £31.4 million and additional revenue from 2022 M&A of £4.0 million and also foreign
exchange movements had a £37.8 million positive effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange
and M&A, North America revenue decreased organically by £17.0 million largely caused by the tail off of
disinfection revenues.
Disinfection revenues reduced by £59.1 million to £1.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£60.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 as COVID-19-related market conditions improved across
the region. Revenue in Pest Control grew by 19.4%, underpinned by further improved price realization. There
was a modest headwind in the period from unseasonably cold weather in certain parts of the country in April
2022 which delayed the start of the pest season. The distribution business delivered good growth in the half
year despite ongoing supply chain challenges, and steps were taken to effectively mitigate this by managing
inventory levels to maintain supply to customers.
Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by £75.2 million to £430.3
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £355.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
product revenue increased by £21.2 million to £135.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£114.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 but these increases were partly offset by job revenue
going down by £40.1 million to £130.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £171.0 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2021.
Europe
Revenue increased by £26.0 million, or 6.4%, to £433.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£407.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was driven by France, which increased
revenues by £10.9 million, or 7.3%, to £159.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £148.7 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2021, Latin America (including Caribbean) increasing by £10.6 million, or
23.1%, to £56.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £46.0 million in the six months ended June
30, 2021 and the Nordics, which increased by £5.5 million, or 15.6%, to £40.4 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022 from £34.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of £7.0 million and additional
revenue from 2022 M&A of £7.6 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £6.0
million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Europe revenue
increased organically by £17.4 million.
The region overall enjoyed strengthened performance, underpinned by both pricing and volumes. Pest
Control, which led the early post-COVID-19 recovery, sustained good growth. The strength was
notwithstanding some pockets of continued supply chain disruption such as the German fumigation
business that was still impacted at port. In Hygiene & Wellbeing there was increased stabilization of
270 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
relationships across sectors, with tourism, notably in southern Europe, catching up more incrementally as
the year proceeded. After an extended period of service suspensions due to COVID-19, Hygiene & Wellbeing
was back to providing full contractual service terms in the majority of markets in which it operates. Ambius,
particularly in northern Europe, benefited from good sales of green products, partly offset by slower
recovery ramp ups in the hospitality market affecting Specialist Hygiene and in the dental recycling business
where the lag from reduced dental visits during COVID-19 was still affecting collection volumes. Improving
market conditions were reflected in the stronger contribution from the France Workwear business, which
overall was back to pre-COVID-19 levels.
Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by £33.8 million to £349.9
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £316.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
product revenue increased by £2.4 million to £18.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £15.7
million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. These increases were partly offset by job revenue going down
by £8.9 million to £63.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £72.1 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2021. Job revenue includes disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, with reduced demand experienced in 2021.
UK & Sub Saharan Africa
Revenue increased by £4.9 million, or 2.8%, to £181.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£176.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was driven by UK, Ireland & Baltics
increasing revenue by £4.7 million, or 3.0%, to £160.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£155.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
This revenue increase included no M&A impact and foreign exchange movements had only a £0.1 million
adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, UK & Sub Saharan Africa revenue
increased organically by £5.0 million.
The region delivered a resilient trading performance against strong comparators in the prior year, which
provided strong growth opportunities in both the medical waste and disinfection business streams. The
universal lifting of restrictions and end of the mass testing regime meant these lines of business slowed
significantly, as anticipated, into the second quarter of 2022. Contract revenue grew by £6.2 million to £128.9
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £122.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
credit notes reduced by £7.3 million to £1.8 million credit in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £5.5
million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. These increases were partly offset by job revenue going down
by £8.0 million to £46.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £54.6 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2021.
Hygiene & Wellbeing operations (including Washrooms, Medical and Specialist Hygiene) delivered good
revenue growth despite the roll back of Medical Testing programmes. The UK Property Care business also
posted a solid performance in the first half of 2022, benefiting from recovery in the commercial property
market, though slightly dampened by domestic property services, where growth slowed in the second
quarter of 2022 in line with the housing market. The Ambius business showed improved performance
reflecting ongoing easing of restrictions in hospitality, office and travel sectors.
Asia & MENAT
Revenue increased by £21.8 million, or 16.9%, to £151.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£129.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of £8.9 million and additional
revenue from 2022 M&A of £0.5 million and by foreign exchange movements having a £4.2 million positive
effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Asia & MENAT revenue increased
organically by £8.2 million.
In general, the Asia & MENAT region delivered an improving performance during the first half of 2022, with
an overall uplift in revenue performance from the last quarter of 2021 into 2022. Sectors hardest hit from the
pandemic such as hospitality, retail and offices, were resuming operations leading to a gradual recovery in
demand for service provision in Pest Control and Hygiene. Sales of air purification solutions also
271 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
gained traction in key markets of Indonesia and Malaysia. Due to new strict COVID-19 lockdowns in the
period, China and Hong Kong countered the trend, with operations in these markets severely curtailed,
driving a spike in temporary customer suspensions. In addition, as expected, after an ongoing good
contribution into the first quarter of 2022, disinfection sales unwound markedly across most of the region
from the beginning of the second quarter. Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract
revenue grew by £14.9 million to £114.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £99.4 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2021, job revenue increased by £3.9 million to £28.5 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022 from £24.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and product revenue increased
by £2.5 million to £9.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £7.3 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2021.
Pacific
Revenue increased by £8.9 million, or 8.9%, to £108.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from
£99.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2021 M&A of £2.7 million and additional
revenue from 2022 M&A of £1.5 million and by foreign exchange movements having a £0.9 million positive
effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pacific revenue increased organically
by £3.8 million.
Performance in the Pacific continued to strengthen. In general, there was increased demand for services
throughout the region with the progressive reopening of markets, international travel and return to offices.
In Hygiene & Wellbeing, there was momentum in portfolio growth due to robust gross sales and strong
customer retention. The region saw sustained demand for the range of air hygiene solutions, including
Viruskiller that was launched in Australia and New Zealand in the second half of 2021. In Pest Control, the
continued strong demand in commercial was supported by a rebound in residential. The performance was
despite some adverse impact from the inclement weather along Australia’s eastern seaboard as well as some
reduced capacity from tightness in the labour market and enforced isolation due to COVID-19. Including the
impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by £6.4 million to £86.8 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2022 from £80.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and job revenue
increased by £1.3 million to £19.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £18.6 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2021.
The table below sets forth revenue by geographic locations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and
2019. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from North America, Europe, UK & Sub Saharan Africa,
Asia & MENAT and Pacific accounted for 44%, 28%, 12%, 9% and 7% of Rentokil Initial’s total revenue,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from North America, Europe, UK & Sub Saharan
Africa, Asia & MENAT and Pacific accounted for 43%, 29%, 12%, 9% and 6% of Rentokil Initial’s total
revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from North America, Europe, UK &
Sub Saharan Africa, Asia & MENAT and Pacific accounted for 39%, 30%, 13%, 10% and 7% of Rentokil
Initial’s total revenue, respectively.

Revenue for Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
North America
Revenue increased by £93.7 million, or 7.8%, to £1,290.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£1,196.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This revenue increase was aided by the incremental
impact of 2020 M&A of £129.2 million and additional revenue from 2021 M&A of £19.8 million but this was
partly offset by foreign exchange movements having a £75.2 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the
effect of foreign exchange and M&A, North America revenue increased organically by £19.9 million. Organic
revenue growth was driven by broad-based momentum in all businesses and an incremental return to more
normalized trading patterns. Rentokil Initial saw good growth in its residential Pest Control portfolio, from
both acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and continued marketing and sales focus.
Residential revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2021 was aided by a continuation of the work
from home business environment. Revenues were supported by ongoing disinfection sales and, as expected,
these significantly tapered throughout the remainder of the year as the COVID-19 pandemic related market
conditions improved. Sales from disinfection amounted to £63.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to £142.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall performance in the year ended
December 31, 2021 was also positively impacted by the recovery of the other commercial businesses: Brand
Standards operations (which was significantly impacted in the year ended December 31, 2020 by temporary
customer closures in the quick serve restaurant sector) returned to more regular trading with 95% of
customers by the end of the year and the Ambius operations returned to pre-pandemic trading levels,
delivering growth of 2.7% on the prior year.
Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by £94.4 million to £741.0
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £646.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and
product revenue increased by £44.2 million to £230.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £186.2
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 but these increases were partly offset by job revenue going
down by £45.2 million to £324.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £369.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020.
The newly acquired business, Environmental Pest Service, the acquisition of which was completed on
January 1, 2021, performed strongly and resulted in benefits from the business’s residential concentration in
three important markets such as Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. The commercial pest control business
growth was aided by good volumes of work broadly across most markets, and improvements were also seen
in bird and mosquito work. The distribution business performed strongly throughout the year, which
reflected the general market recovery of the pest services sector and the continued high demand for lawn,
golf and turf products.
Europe
Revenue increased by £11.4 million, or 1.4%, to £832.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£820.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by Southern Europe, which
increased revenues by £5.9 million, or 4.1%, to £148.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£143.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, Latin America (including Caribbean) increasing by £6.4
million, or 7.3%, to £94.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £88.5 million in the year

ended December 31, 2020 and France, which increased by £3.2 million, or 1.1%, to £306.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021 from £303.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. These increases were
partially offset by Germany revenues decreasing by £6.7 million, or 5.6%, to £113.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 from £120.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2020 M&A of £0.5 million and additional
revenue from 2021 M&A of £16.9 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £23.3
million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Europe revenue
increased organically by £17.3 million.
The Europe region continued to experience disruption from lock-downs and intermittent restrictions
throughout the year ended December 31, 2021. Despite these challenges, Workwear (France) made a good
recovery and the core segments performed well, with the Pest Control segment largely back to normal and
experiencing good growth, and with Hygiene & Wellbeing recovering well. Throughout the year, Rentokil
Initial saw customers who remained closed reducing from 10% in the first half of the year ended December
31, 2021 to less than 1% in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021, with trading in most
countries returning to more normal levels. Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract
revenue grew by £19.0 million to £654.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £635.7 million in the
year ended December 31, 2020, product revenue increased by £3.3 million to £32.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 from £29.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and other revenue went up by £7.1
million to £19.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £12.0m in the year ended December 31,
2020. These increases were partly offset by job revenue going down by £19.3 million to £133.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 2021 from £152.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Job revenue includes
disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with reduced demand
experienced in 2021.
While Rentokil Initial continued to experience some interruptions from restrictions imposed during the fourth
and fifth waves of the COVID-19 virus, the impact was more on COVID-19 infections in colleagues, affecting
their availability rather than on customer closures. Revenue growth of 8.1% in Pest Control for the year
ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by continued lock-downs across parts of Europe and Latin America
and poor weather in Europe which delayed the emergence of pests such as wasps and mosquitoes. The
Hygiene & Wellbeing segment (excluding disinfection) grew by 3.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021,
with most growth generated in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2021 due to weak comparatives
as a result of the impact from lock-downs in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020 . As expected,
revenue from disinfection services in 2021 tapered significantly throughout the year ended December 31,
2021. Lock-downs began to ease in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021 across all markets,
resulting in an improving performance from the France Workwear segment, which declined by 1.2% in the
year ended December 31, 2021, an improvement from the rate of decline in the year ended December 31, 2020.
The France Workwear segment was nevertheless impacted by temporary customer suspensions of 3.4%
throughout the year (being the average percentage of customer premises closed, and hence not able to be
serviced, during the year).
UK & Sub Saharan Africa
Revenue increased by £31.7 million, or 9.7%, to £359.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£327.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by UK, Ireland & Baltics
increasing revenue by £29.8 million, or 10.3%, to £318.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£288.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and Sub Saharan Africa increasing revenue by £1.9
million, or 4.8%, to £40.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £38.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020.
This revenue increase included no M&A impact and foreign exchange movements had only a £0.4 million
adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, UK & Sub Saharan Africa revenue
increased organically by £32.1 million.
Trading conditions in the UK businesses, which were impacted by lock-downs in the first quarter of the year
ended December 31, 2021, improved significantly from the second quarter of the year ended December 31,
2021 as a result of continued progress with the UK’s vaccination programme and subsequent
274 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
easing of restrictions. Recovery of the Irish operations was behind the UK, reflecting continuing government
restrictions, however, the trajectory of improvement was similar to that experienced in the UK, although at an
earlier stage. A number of key actions undertaken in the year ended December 31, 2020 aided performance in
the UK in 2021, including accelerating the pace of Rentokil Initial’s service differentiation, innovation and
digital marketing programmes and implementing a number of significant technology-enabled business and
cost programmes. Contract revenue grew by £4.8 million to £251.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £246.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and credit notes reduced by £26.7 million to
£5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £32.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Hygiene & Wellbeing segment in the UK performed strongly throughout the year, driven by strong
organic performances and the full year performance of the integrated Cannon Hygiene business. The Ambius
business performed well, growing contract portfolio in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021
as the challenge to make office spaces suitably appealing for employee return stimulated demand for Rentokil
Initial’s products and services. The Property Care business also performed well, with revenues benefiting
from strong domestic customer demand in the UK residential housing market and signs of recovery in the
commercial property market.
The Sub Saharan Africa region delivered a robust performance despite ongoing pandemic related challenges,
increasing revenue by £1.9 million, or 4.8%, to £40.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £38.8
million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Asia & MENAT
Revenue increased by £8.0 million, or 3%, to £271.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £263.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This revenue increase was driven by MENAT increasing
revenue by £7.6 million, or 35.3%, to £28.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £21.3 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020, India increasing revenue by £4.9 million, or 10.1%, to £53.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 2021 from £48.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and China improving
by £2.9 million, or 19.1%, to £17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from £15.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020. This was partly offset by a revenue decrease in Indonesia of £2.3 million, or 5.0%,
to £42.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £44.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020
and also in Malaysia of £1.4 million, or 4.0%, to £33.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £34.8
million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2020 M&A of £0.5 million and additional
revenue from 2021 M&A of £8.4 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £14.4
million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Asia & MENAT
revenue increased organically by £13.5 million.
This was an improving performance, but recovery was held back by difficult trading conditions in Malaysia,
Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand as a result of very restrictive lock-downs from late second quarter of the
year ended December 31, 2021 and into the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021. With fewer
restrictions and a higher vaccination rate, China performed considerably better, delivering revenue growth of
19.1% in the year ended December 31, 2021. Despite ongoing macro-economic challenges in Lebanon, the
Boecker business, acquired in August 2021, performed well with integration proceeding according to plan.
Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by £6.7 million to £204.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £197.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 but job revenue
decreased by £2.5 million to £52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £54.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020. Credit notes reduced by £3.6 million to £3.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £6.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Job revenue included disinfection revenue,
which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which decreased by £0.7 million to £13.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £14.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Both the Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing segments continued to be impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic and lock-downs in the year ended December 31, 2021, with temporary customer suspensions
peaking at 7.9% in August 2021 but falling to 2.8% by December 2021, as Rentokil Initial’s markets recovered

and its ability to service customers improved. Emergency disinfection services were broadly similar in both
the first and second half of the year ended December 31, 2021, providing a hedge to disruption of regular
core service provision.
Pacific
Revenue increased by £19.0 million, or 10.7%, to £196.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£177.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Australia revenue increased by £17.5 million, or 13.3%, to
£149.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £131.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020
and New Zealand grew by £2.0 million, or 4.7%, to £45.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
£43.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
This revenue increase was aided by additional revenue from 2021 M&A of £4.2 million and by foreign
exchange movements having a £3.7 million positive effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign
exchange and M&A, Pacific revenue increased organically by £11.1 million.
The core businesses in the Pacific delivered a much improved performance in the year ended December 31,
2021, despite intermittent lock-downs in both Australia and New Zealand impacting revenue, primarily in New
Zealand which continued a suppression strategy towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian
operations were more robust, reflecting the easing of government restrictions despite the arrival of the
Omicron variant in November 2021. Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue
grew by £8.1 million to £158.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £150.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020 and job revenue increased by £6.8 million to £36.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 from £29.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Credit notes reduced by £4.6
million to £4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £8.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2020. Job revenue includes disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19
pandemic, which decreased by £0.5 million to £1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £1.8
million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Demand for the Pest Control services was strong throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, particularly
in commercial pest control and bird control. Residential work in the second half of the year ended December
31, 2021 was slightly weaker than in the first half of the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting customers
deferring treatments during periods of lock-down. In the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment, core service
provision recovered well, although the second half of the year ended December 31, 2021 saw some
weakening in service levels due to temporary site closures. Portfolio growth was strong, however, with
customers responding positively to the relaunched air hygiene proposition, which was a major source of
growth, and the hand sanitizer portfolio was largely maintained. The Ambius business performed well in the
year ended December 31, 2021, with portfolio growth above 10% as businesses began to prepare for a return
to offices.
Revenue for Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
North America
Revenue increased by £131.5 million, or 12.3%, to £1,196.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£1,065.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This revenue increase was aided by the incremental
impact of 2019 M&A of £58.4 million and additional revenue from 2020 M&A of £10.9 million but this was
partly offset by foreign exchange movements having a £15.4 million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the
effect of foreign exchange and M&A, North America revenue increased organically by £77.6 million.
Revenues in North America were supported by high volume of sales of disinfection services launched in the
second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020 and a good performance from the Pest Control business.
Demand for residential pest control remained strong, but commercial pest services were impacted by
temporary business closures. Ambius and Brand Standards also saw significant disruption to services,
reflecting the more discretionary nature of Ambius products and Brand Standards’ exposure to the fast food
sector, which also suffered from temporary business suspensions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue grew by £43.8 million to £646.6
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £602.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and job
revenue increased by £109.1 million to £369.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £260.8 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019 but these increases were partly offset by product revenue going down
by £19.9 million to £186.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £206.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019. Job revenue benefited from disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, of £142.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (£nil in the year ended
December 31, 2019).
Europe
Revenue increased by £18.1 million, or 2.3%, to £820.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£802.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by Germany, which increased
revenues by £13.1 million, or 12.1%, to £120.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £107.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019 and Southern Europe, which increased by £8.5 million, or 6.3%, to
£143.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £134.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
These increases were partially offset by France revenues decreasing by £7.2 million, or 2.3%, to £303.2
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £310.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of £8.5 million and additional
revenue from 2020 M&A of £8.7 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £4.0
million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Europe revenue
increased organically by £4.9 million.
The Europe region saw a mixed impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries were less
impacted due to early and effective lock-downs, such as Germany, other regions, including France and parts
of Southern Europe, were more severely impacted. In Latin America, while revenues in the Pest Control
segment declined, overall performance for the year was aided by disinfection sales. Including the impacts of
M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue fell by £20.2 million to £635.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020 from £655.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 but job revenue increased by
£48.1 million to £152.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £104.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019. Hygiene & Wellbeing was the region’s best performing segment, with good contributions
from disinfection and products. The Pest Control segment delivered a robust performance in the year ended
December 31, 2020, while France Workwear was most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, being particularly
affected by temporary business closures in the hospitality and food services sector.
UK & Sub Saharan Africa
Revenue decreased by £21.1 million, or 6.0%, to £327.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£348.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was driven by UK, Ireland & Baltics
decreasing revenue by £18.0 million, or 5.9%, to £288.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£306.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and Sub Saharan Africa decreasing by £3.1 million, or
7.3%, to £38.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £41.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2019.
This revenue decrease included the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of £0.5 million and additional revenue
from 2020 M&A of £0.9 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £4.6 million
adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, UK & Sub Saharan Africa
revenue fell organically by £17.9 million.
The UK and Sub Saharan Africa region was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in
April 2020, which was the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic for Rentokil Initial. The Hygiene businesses in the
UK and Ireland were unable to service customers within many sectors, but primarily the hospitality and food
services sector which was subjected to government restrictions and lock-downs throughout the year. The
Pest Control business in the UK also saw revenue declines in the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting
temporary business closures and suspensions. In contrast, the Specialist Hygiene, Medical and Products
businesses performed well, benefiting from increased disinfection services.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Disinfection revenue, which was introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, generated revenue of
£12.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Ambius and Property Care were severely impacted as a
result of customers cutting their spending on more discretionary services such as interior landscaping and
plants, with Property Care further impacted by weakness in the UK commercial housing market. Overall, Job
revenue grew by £6.7 million to £99.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £93.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2019 and credit notes increased by £27.8 million to £32.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020 from £4.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Asia & MENAT
Revenue increased by £3.2 million, or 1.3%, to £263.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £260.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This revenue increase was driven by Indonesia increasing
revenue by £8.4 million, or 23.2%, to £44.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £36.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019, Hong Kong increasing by £3.5 million, or 18.1%, to £22.8 million in the
year ended December 31, 2020 from £19.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and Singapore
improving by £1.9 million, or 7.1%, to £29.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £27.7 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019. This was offset by a revenue decrease in India of £12.8 million, or 20.8%,
to £48.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £61.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019
and also in Malaysia of £2.8 million, or 7.5%, to £34.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £37.6
million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
This revenue increase was aided by the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of £10.3 million and additional
revenue from 2020 M&A of £3.2 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £8.1
million adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Asia & MENAT
revenue fell organically by £2.2 million.
China, Hong Kong and South Korea were among the first countries to be impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic and, as a result, were the first to recover, with strong demand for disinfection and hygiene product
sales offsetting falls in contract revenue from other countries. Country performance across Asia was mixed in
the year ended December 31, 2020, with Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and Sri Lanka
performing well, but with India and Malaysia experiencing the worst impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Including the impacts of M&A and foreign exchange, contract revenue fell by £4.3 million to £197.8 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020 from £202.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 but job revenue
increased by £12.8 million to £54.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £42.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019. Job revenue benefited from disinfection revenue of £14.0 million, which was
introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit notes increased by £5.2 million to £6.8 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020 from £1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Pacific
Revenue decreased by £8.3 million, or 4.5%, to £177.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£185.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Australia revenue decreased by £4.6 million, or 3.4%, to
£131.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £136.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019
and New Zealand declined by £2.9 million, or 6.3%, to £43.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
£46.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
This revenue decrease included the incremental impact of 2019 M&A of £1.3 million and additional revenue
from 2020 M&A of £1.1 million but this was offset by foreign exchange movements having a £3.5 million
adverse effect on revenue. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and M&A, Pacific revenue fell
organically by £7.2 million.
All operations were impacted by the crisis as a result of government restrictions, particularly in New Zealand
which entered into a lock-down in late March 2020. Pest Control revenue in the region fell by 3.2% in the
year ended December 31, 2020 and Hygiene declined by 6.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2019. Job revenue grew by £1.8 million to £29.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020 from £28.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the newly
introduced disinfection services, but product revenue decreased by £1.4 million to £6.2 million in the year

Non-IFRS Alternative Indicative Measures
Rentokil Initial uses a number of measures to present the financial performance of the business which are not
IFRS measures as defined under IFRS. Management believes these measures provide valuable additional
information for users of the Financial Statements in order to better understand the underlying trading
performance in the year from activities and businesses that will contribute to future performance. Rentokil
Initial’s internal strategic planning process is also based on these measures and they are used for incentive
purposes. They should be viewed as complements to, and not replacements for, the comparable IFRS
measures.
Constant Exchange Rates (CER)
Given the international nature of Rentokil Initial’s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a
significant impact on the reported results of Rentokil Initial when they are translated into sterling (the
functional currency of Rentokil Initial). In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of
the business, revenue and profit measures are often presented at CER. CER is calculated by translating
current-period reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior year, in order to give
management and other users of the accounts better visibility of underlying trading performance against the
prior period. The major exchange rates used for the comparisons between the six months ended June 30, 2022
and June 30, 2021 are £/$ 1.3739 and £/​€ 1.1617. The major exchange rates used for the comparisons between
the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are £/$ 1.2951 and £/​€ 1.1315. The major exchange
rates used for the comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are £/$
1.2790 and £/€ 1.1419.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The primary source of Rentokil Initial’s liquidity over the last three years was cash generated from
operations. These funds were generally used to pay interest, taxes and dividends, and to fund capital
expenditure and acquisitions, and, Rentokil Initial expects to continue to fund future operating and capital
needs. Rentokil Initial considers its working capital to be sufficient for its present requirements.

Net cash inflows from operating activities decreased by £70.7 million, or 21.3%, to £261.1 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2022 from £331.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The main driver of this
decrease was the decrease in working capital flows of £76.1 million to £14.4 million outflow in the six months
ended June 30, 2022 from £61.7 million inflow in the six months ended June 30, 2021 due to the heightened
focus in the six months ended June 30, 2021 on working capital management in order to optimize inventory
levels and to try to mitigate the increased risk around the delay and non-payment of receivables that has
since lessened. Also, in the current macro-economic environment, the Group worked

hard with customers and suppliers to manage supply chain challenges, investing in higher inventories, with
cash outflows up £20.3m relative to the first half of 2021 to provide confidence in the Group’s ability to
maintain supply to customers. The net impact of interest and tax paid was an increase of £11.5 million to
£50.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £39.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.
This was partially offset by an increase in Operating Profit by £9.1 million, to £169.7 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022 from £160.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Within Operating Profit, non-
cash items moved as follows: (1) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment increased by £4.5 million to
£105.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £100.6 million in the six months ended June 30,
2021, (2) Amortization and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) increased by £2.6
million to £39.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £37.1 million in the six months ended June
30, 2021, (3) Amortization and impairment of computer software increased by £1.1 million to £8.6 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2022 from £7.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and (4) Other non-
cash items decreased by £0.4 million to £3.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £3.6 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Investing Activities
Net cash outflows from investing activities decreased by £116.0 million, or 35.7%, to £208.6 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2022 from £324.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The main drivers of
this decrease were outflows from acquisition of companies and businesses decreasing by £127.3 million to
£127.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £254.7 million in the six months ended June 30,
2021, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment increasing by £8.8 million to £67.9
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £59.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021,
reflecting a more normal pattern of spend as the pandemic was exited.
Financing Activities
Net cash flows from financing activities increased by £1,631.6 million to a £1,470.6 million inflow in the six
months ended June 30, 2022 from a £161.0 million outflow in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The main
drivers of this increase were inflows from proceeds from new debt increasing by £1,742.3 million to £1,743.8
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £1.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021, and
dividends paid decreasing by £20.4 million to £79.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £100.0
million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was partially offset by outflows from debt
repayments increasing by £127.1 million to £136.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from £9.1
million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cash Flow for Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Operating Activities
Net cash inflows from operating activities increased by £15.8 million, or 2.9%, to £563.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021 from £547.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The main driver of this
increase was the increase in Operating Profit by £52.8 million, to £346.5 million in the year ended December
31, 2021 from £293.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Within Operating Profit, non-cash items
moved as follows: (1) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment decreased by £3.9 million to £128.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £132.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to
capital expenditures spend being lower in 2020 as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. (2) Depreciation of
leased assets increased by £0.4 million to £78.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £78.0
million in the year ended December 31, 2020. (3) Amortization and impairment of intangible assets (excluding
computer software) decreased by £8.2 million to £74.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £82.5
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to non repeat of goodwill impairments of £8.1 million related
to the Rentokil PCI cash generating unit (CGU) and £2.5 million related to the Brazil CGU that occurred in the
year ended December 31 2020. (4) Amortization and impairment of computer software decreased by £1.7
million to £16.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £18.5 million in the year ended December
31, 2020 due to lower software capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic. (5) Other non-cash items increased by £6.3 million to £5.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £(0.5) million in the year ended December 31, 2020 mainly due to higher non-cash share based
payment costs. Cash interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by £4.5 million to £68.9
million from £64.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher profits.
This increase in Operating Profit was partially offset by a decrease in working capital inflow of £30.0 million
to £18.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £48.8 million inflow in the year ended December 31,
2020 due to the heightened focus in the year ended December 31, 2020 on working capital management in
order to optimize inventory levels and to try to mitigate the increased risk around the delay and non-payment
of receivables. This is reflected in the trade and other receivables inflow increasing by £78.1 million to £58.8
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from a £19.3 million outflow in the year ended December 31, 2020
due to the faster collection of accounts receivable balances, the trade and other payable and provisions
outflow increasing by £121.2 million to £43.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from a £78.2 million
inflow in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the inventories outflow decreasing by £20.1 million to £3.2
million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from £23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The net
impact of interest and tax paid was a decrease of £0.1 million to £105.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 from £105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investing Activities
Net cash outflows from investing activities decreased by £56.4 million, or 11.3%, to £441.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021 from £497.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The main drivers of this
decrease were net investment in term deposits changing by £341.1 million to a £170.6 million inflow for the
year ended December 31, 2021 from a £170.5 million outflow in the year ended December 31, 2020, partially
offset by outflows from acquisitions of companies and businesses increasing by £268.4 million to £463.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from £194.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Financing Activities
Net cash flows from financing activities decreased by £646.6 million to a £417.1 million outflow in the year
ended December 31, 2021 from a £229.5 million inflow in the year ended December 31, 2020. The main drivers
of this decrease were inflows from proceeds from new debt decreasing by £1,686.1 million to £4.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 from £1,690.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, and dividends
paid increasing by £138.7 million to £138.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from nil in the year
ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by outflows from debt

£1,352.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cash Flow for Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Operating Activities
Net cash inflows from operating activities increased by £84.8 million, or 18.3%, to £547.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020 from £462.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The first driver of this
increase was the increase in Operating Profit by £28.1 million, to £293.7 million in the year ended December
31, 2020 from £265.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Within Operating Profit, non-cash items
moved as follows: (1) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment increased by £6.0 million to £132.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £127.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to
capital expenditures spend being higher in 2020. (2) Depreciation of leased assets decreased by £0.8 million
to £78.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £78.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
(3) Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) decreased by £2.7 million
to £82.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £85.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019
lower amortization of customer relationships offset by goodwill impairments of £8.1 million related to the
Rentokil PCI cash generating unit (CGU) and £2.5 million related to the Brazil CGU that occurred in the year
ended December 31 2020. (4) Amortisation and impairment of computer software increased by £4.9 million to
£18.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due
to higher software capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020. (5) Other non-cash items
increased by £(4.8) million to £(0.5) million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £(4.3) million in the year
ended December 31, 2019 due higher profit on sales from tangible and intangible assets. Cash interest paid in
the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by £21.2 million to £64.4 million from £43.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019 due to higher profits.
The second driver of this increase was the increase in working capital inflow of £60.1 million to £48.8 million
in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £11.3 million outflow in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to
the heightened focus in the year ended December 31, 2020 on working capital management in order to
optimize inventory levels and to try to mitigate the increased risk around the delay and non-payment of
receivables. This is reflected in the trade and other receivables outflow decreasing by £13.4 million to £19.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £32.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and the
trade and other payables and provisions inflow increasing by £58.0 million to £78.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020 from £20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Inventories outflow increased by
£19.7 million to £23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from £3.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019 due to the purchase of additional personal protective equipment.
Investing Activities
Net cash outflows from investing activities increased by £435.4 million, or 701.1%, to £497.5 million in the
year ended December 31, 2020 from £62.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The main drivers of
this were inflows from disposal of companies and businesses decreasing by £389.7 million to £2.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020 from £391.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and net
investment in term deposits changing by £171.2 million to a £170.5 million outflow for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from a £0.7 million inflow in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset
by outflows from acquisitions of companies and businesses decreasing by £121.0 million to £194.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from £315.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Financing Activities
Net cash flows from financing activities increased by £449.5 million to £229.5 million inflow in the year ended
December 31, 2020 from £220.0 million outflow in the year ended December 31, 2019. The main drivers of this
were inflows of £540.4 million from a new €600 million bond issue partially offset by a bond and loan
repayment of £197.4 million. Dividends paid decreased by £85.8 million to nil in the year ended December 31,
2020 from £85.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Debt of £1.2 billion was raised
286 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
during the year ended December 31, 2020 (separately to the above bond) as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, which was repaid in the same year.
In addition, in July 2021, the remaining €175.7 million outstanding under the €350 million bond due in October
2021 was repaid. There are no debt maturities falling due in 2022. For further information, see Note C7 of
Rentokil Initial’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement/​prospectus.
Debt
Revolving Credit Facility
As of June 30, 2022, Rentokil Initial had a £550 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”). The interest rate
applicable to the RCF is the relevant risk-free rate plus a margin based on Rentokil Initial’s credit rating from
time to time. As of June 30, 2022, the applicable margin was 0.40% per annum. Management reviews other
terms and conditions of Rentokil Initial’s bonds and bank debt regularly, and as of June 30, 2022, Rentokil
Initial was compliant with the terms and conditions of its debt facilities.
The RCF is provided by a syndicate of banks being: Banco Santander S.A., London Branch; Bank of America
Europe Designated Activity Company; Barclays Bank PLC; Bayerische Landesbank; BNP Paribas, London
Branch; Goldman Sachs Bank USA; HSBC UK Bank plc; ING Bank N.V., London Branch; Mizuho Bank, Ltd;
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ); Standard Chartered Bank; Bank of China Limited, London Branch;
DBS Bank Limited, London Branch; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch; Scotiabank Europe plc;
United Overseas Bank Limited, London Branch; and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., London Branch. The RCF
matures on August 20, 2025. As at June 30, 2022 the RCF was undrawn.
European Medium Term Notes
All of the bonds issued under Rentokil Initial’s Euro Medium Term Note Programme prior to June 9, 2022
contain a coupon step-up which increases the coupon payable by 1.25% in the event that Rentokil Initial is
downgraded to BB+ or below (sub-investment grade).
On June 27, 2022, Rentokil Initial and its subsidiary issued (i) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2027 in an
aggregate principal amount of €850 million, (ii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2030 in an aggregate
principal amount of €600 million and (iii) senior unsecured notes due June 27, 2032 in an aggregate principal

updated on June 9, 2022. For more information, see “The Merger Proposal - The Rentokil Initial Debt
Financing - New Senior Notes” beginning on page 120. The bonds may be called by Rentokil Initial at 101%
in the event the acquisition of Terminix does not complete by March 13, 2023.
The bonds may be called by their investors at par in the event of a change of control. They may also be
called within 120 days if Rentokil Initial’s debt is downgraded below investment grade, or if the rating is
withdrawn and the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or to Rentokil Initial or the trustee, that
the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to a change of control. For further information, see
Note C7 of Rentokil Initial’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/​prospectus.
Facility A and Facility B

information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Proposal - The
Rentokil Initial Debt Financing” beginning on page 119.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Rentokil Initial does not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Rentokil Initial’s primary
market risks include foreign currency exchange rate risks on transacting in multiple geographies around the
world and in repatriation of profits to the UK, and in interest rate risks on cost of financing. Rentokil Initial is
exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures
to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by taking advantage of
natural hedges within us. Potential risks are discussed below.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks
Rentokil Initial’s worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies. Sales and
purchases are typically denominated in the currency of the country in which they are transacted, and cross-
border procurement is considered insignificant.
Rentokil Initial’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is in relation to the translation of assets and
liabilities, and Rentokil Initial aims to hold debt in currencies in proportion to its forecast foreign currency
profits and investments. Foreign currency exchange (“FX”) derivatives are used to manage foreign currency
exposures in excess of £0.5 million (£5.0 million for USD) that are not covered by debt or assets in the same
(or another highly correlated) currency, as long as it makes sense from an economic perspective to do so.
Rentokil Initial’s Treasury Committee monitors foreign exchange exposures on a monthly basis. Dealing in
foreign exchange products is controlled by dealing mandates approved by the Treasury Committee and all
FX transactions are covered by International Swap and Derivative Association documentation. The most
significant foreign currency groups are U.S. dollars and euros, which make up 43.8% and 35.1% of operating
profit, respectively as of June 30, 2022 and 41.5% and 34.8% of operating profit, respectively as of December
31, 2021.
At June 30, 2022, net debt was approximately 49% U.S. dollar, reflecting that it is the principal cash flow
exposure, and 53% euro, with 2% net cash offset in other currencies. At December 31, 2021, net debt was
approximately 57% U.S. dollar and 45% euro, with 2% net cash offset in other currencies. The translation of
the interest element of euro and U.S. dollar debt provides a partial income statement offset to the translation
of earnings.
At each year end Rentokil Initial calculates the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive
income of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates. The principal foreign currency exposure is the euro. A
10% movement in £/​€ would result in a £15.6 million increase/decrease in operating profit, offset by a £1.0
million decrease/increase in interest payable. At December 31, 2021, for U.S. dollars, a 10% movement in £/$
would result in a £19.4 million increase/decrease in operating profit, offset by a £1.6 million decrease/​increase
in interest payable. Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in
preference to selling currency in the market.
Interest Rate Risks
Rentokil Initial seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge while
allowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of its cash flows. Interest rate risk is
managed by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which are approved in advance by the
Treasury Committee. Rentokil Initial’s policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate
exposures (excluding pensions) for a minimum period of 12 months forward. The Treasury Committee reviews
this exposure monthly. In fiscal 2021, Interbank Offered Rates Fallback Protocols were signed
288 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
with the two banks that used to provide interest rate hedges that reference London Interbank Offered Rates
(“LIBOR”). Rentokil Initial has no other LIBOR-based exposures.
Rentokil Initial had outstanding bond debt issues at June 30, 2022 with a market value of £2,842.3 million.
This was below the book value of £2,915.8 million. At December 31, 2021 the outstanding bond debt issues
had a market value of £1,272.1 million. This exceeded the book value of £1,253.7 million. There are no
circumstances where Rentokil Initial would be obliged to pay the fair market value. Rentokil Initial could,
however, decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is indicative of the price
that would be required to do so.
At December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro interest rates would reduce the market value of
the existing bond liabilities by £61.9 million. The income statement impact is nil as changes in interest rates
do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Rentokil Initial makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and assumptions are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates and revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.
Sensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in Rentokil Initial’s consolidated
financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this proxy statement/​prospectus.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below:
impairment of goodwill: growth rate and discount rate assumptions and forecast cash flow estimates;
income taxes: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of outflows in relation to tax
provisions; and
retirement benefits: key actuarial assumptions and estimates over future costs of winding up a
scheme.
For further information, see Rentokil Initial’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
proxy statement/prospectus.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Rentokil Initial’s share of
the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisition
of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost
less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit. The
recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow
projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units
have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.
Details of Rentokil Initial’s impairment review and sensitivities to changes in assumptions are disclosed in
detail in Rentokil Initial’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere
in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Income taxes
Rentokil Initial is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Rentokil Initial
289 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
recognizes liabilities for anticipated settlement of tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes
will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially
recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such
determination is made.
Rentokil Initial carries appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax computations are agreed with
the taxation authorities.
Current and deferred tax are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except when
the tax relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with directly
in equity.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following temporary
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or
liabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither
the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted (or substantively enacted) at the balance sheet date, and
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax
liability is settled. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the timing differences relate to income
taxes levied by the same tax authority on an entity or different entities which are part of a tax consolidation
and there would be the intention to settle on a net basis.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. The amount of deferred tax assets
recognized at each balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect changes in management’s assessment of future
taxable profits. In recognizing the deferred tax asset in respect of losses, management has estimated the
quantum of future taxable profits applying a risk weighting to future profits to reflect the uncertainties.
Current tax is recognized based on the amounts expected to be paid or recovered under the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Retirement benefits
The principal pension scheme in Rentokil Initial is the UK Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme (RIPS) which
has a defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new
entrants and future accrual of benefits. The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from Rentokil Initial and
the Trustee of the RIPS is Rentokil Initial Pension Trustee Limited. The Trustee board comprises five
company-nominated directors and three member-nominated directors. The Trustee is required by law to act in
the best interests of the members and beneficiaries of the RIPS and is responsible for setting certain policies
(e.g., investment, contribution and indexation policies) of the scheme.
The defined benefit schemes of the RIPS are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based
upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements (including schemes which are insured
under a buy-in contract).
On December 4, 2018 the Trustee entered into a binding agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation to
insure the liabilities of the RIPS, known as a buy-in. In December 2021 the final true-up premium was paid to
PIC and on February 24, 2022 the insurance policy with PIC was transferred to the individual members of the
scheme.
There remains some uncertainty regarding the final surplus that will be available to Rentokil Initial until all
remaining Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) adjustments for members who transferred out of the scheme
have been settled and final scheme expenses have been paid. The remaining surplus recognized as a
retirement benefit asset is management’s estimate of the value that will be returned to Rentokil Initial when
wind-up of the scheme completes, however this is based on estimates and assumptions as to which
290

TABLE OF CONTENTS
members will be able to be traced, the value of GMP adjustments that will be made to these members, and the
cost of future expenses incurred by the scheme between the balance sheet date and closure of the scheme.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards
As set out in Rentokil Initial’s Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, Rentokil Initial has adopted the
following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other
standards, with effect from January 1, 2022:
Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16
Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to IAS 37
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020
Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IFRS 3.
The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures of the amounts
recognized in Rentokil Initial’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. Consequently, no adjustment has been made to the
comparative financial information at June 30, 2021, or December 31, 2020. Rentokil Initial has not early
adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.

Information regarding the remuneration provided to Rentokil Initial’s Directors, Executive Directors and ELT
has been split into multiple sections for ease of reference. This introductory section provides an overview of
Rentokil Initial’s Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) and the activities undertaken during the year.
The sections beginning with the section entitled “- Directors’ Remuneration in the Year Ending December
31, 2021”, beginning on page 300, provide an explanation of how the Policy was implemented during 2021
and shows the alignment between Rentokil Initial’s strategy, remuneration framework and performance, as
well as the payments made to Directors, Executive Directors and ELT members during this period and
information on the shareholdings of Rentokil Initial’s Directors, Executive Directors and ELT members. For
reference, a summary of the Policy is included in the section entitled “- Summary of Rentokil Initial’s 2021
Directors’ Remuneration Policy”, beginning on page 316.
Remuneration Committee Responsibilities
The Committee’s main responsibilities are developing and setting the Policy and overseeing its application.
It determines and agrees the policy with the Rentokil Initial board of directors and approves individual
remuneration arrangements for Rentokil Initial’s Chairman, Executive Directors and members of the ELT. It
reviews executive performance and strives to ensure that remuneration structures align the interests of
management with those of shareholders and operate in the long-term best interests of Rentokil Initial.
The Committee oversees contractual terms on termination affecting Executive Directors and members of the
ELT, and seeks to ensure that any payments made are both fair to the individual and to Rentokil Initial, that
failure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised. The Committee also oversees
Rentokil Initial’s incentive schemes, including the operation and effectiveness of performance measures and
targets in both the annual bonus plan and the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). It also lends oversight to
major changes in employee remuneration across the Rentokil Initial group.
Membership and Attendance
During 2021, the Committee members were:
Cathy Turner (appointed Chair on May 12, 2021)
Sarosh Mistry, appointed April 1, 2021
Julie Southern
Linda Yueh
Angela Seymour-Jackson (resigned as Non-Executive Director and Chair on May 12, 2021)
The number of scheduled Committee meetings in 2021 returned to the usual level of four meetings per year
following the increase to five in 2020 to support the review of the Policy. The Rentokil Initial HR
297 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director, the Rentokil Initial General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Rentokil Initial Deputy Company
Secretary (who acts as secretary to the Committee) and the Rentokil Initial Head of Reward also attend
Committee meetings.
The Rentokil Initial HR Director has direct access to the Chair of the Committee and, together with the
Rentokil Initial Head of Reward, advises the Committee on remuneration matters relating to Executive
Directors and members of the ELT. Rentokil Initial’s Chairman also attends meetings and makes
recommendations in relation to the remuneration and incentive arrangements for the Chief Executive. The
Chief Executive attends meetings and makes recommendations in respect of remuneration arrangements for
his direct reports. No Executive Director or member of the ELT is present when their own remuneration is
under consideration.
The Committee members have a broad and diverse set of skills and knowledge that, when combined, bring
the necessary level of experience and know-how to ensure that remuneration matters are dealt with in a
balanced, independent and informed manner. No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest
in the matters to be decided by the Committee, other than as a shareholder. No member of the Committee has
any conflict of interest in carrying out their role on the Committee arising from other directorships nor does
any member participate in any of Rentokil Initial’s incentive or pension arrangements or have any
involvement in the day-to-day running of Rentokil Initial.
In order to avoid any conflict of interest, remuneration is managed through well-defined processes ensuring
no individual is involved in the decision-making process related to their own remuneration. The Committee
also receives support from external advisors and evaluates the support provided by those advisors annually
to ensure that advice is independent, appropriate and cost-effective.
Remuneration Committee Effectiveness
The Committee undertook a review of its performance during 2021 as part of the broader external Rentokil
Initial board of directors evaluation. The review concluded that the Committee continued to operate
effectively. The Committee Chair succession process was regarded as exemplary and very smooth. The
review also rated the current composition of the Committee as excellent and concluded that discussions held
covered all key areas and enabled positive input from Committee members.
External Advisors
Material advice and/or services were provided to the Committee during 2021 by FIT Remuneration
Consultants LLP (FIT) who are retained to provide independent advice on executive remuneration matters
and on Rentokil Initial’s long-term incentive arrangements. FIT was appointed on November 6, 2018 by the
Committee following a review of its advisors. FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and
adheres to its code in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Fees charged during the year
for advice to the Committee by FIT were £22,466 and were accrued on a time and materials basis. FIT also
acts as remuneration advisor to the remuneration committees of Trustpilot A/S, which Angela Seymour-
Jackson chairs, and Aldermore, which Cathy Turner chairs. However, the Committee is satisfied that this has
not impaired their independence in any way. FIT has no other material connections with Rentokil Initial or
any Director, and the Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. FIT did
not provide any other services during the year.

Context of Business Performance
Rentokil Initial had an outstanding year in 2021, growing ongoing revenue by 9.9% and ongoing operating
profit by 19.5%. These results were not just outstanding in comparison to 2020, they are outstanding
compared to pre-COVID levels with ongoing revenue growth of 16.8% compared to 2019 and ongoing
operating profit growth of 26.3%.
Despite this the Committee still gave careful consideration as to whether or not the outcomes for the annual
bonus were reflective of overall Rentokil Initial performance, in both the context of the year in question and
pre-pandemic levels, when the performance was reviewed against the targets. The Committee also assessed
that the targets set were truly stretching, given the level of outperformance, and determined that they were
as the maximum targets were set well above the guidance of 3%-4% ongoing revenue growth and c.10%
ongoing operating profit growth, with requirements to achieve above c.8% and c.14% growth, respectively.
The results were also considered in the context of wider stakeholders and it was deemed that no discretion
should be applied to adjust the outcome. This is due to remuneration returning to normal for colleagues of all
levels with no requirements to make any temporary reductions to Rentokil Initial’s colleagues remuneration
in 2021. There were no requirements to access government support in the UK and Rentokil Initial’s
shareholders have also shared in this success, as Rentokil Initial returned to paying dividends in 2021, with
shareholders receiving 5.41p in May and 2.09p in September. Both dividend payments were significantly
above 2019 levels. The price per Rentokil Initial ordinary share also continued to grow throughout 2021,
ending 14.6% higher at the end of the year, having grown from 509.6p to 584.0p year on year.
2021 Annual Bonus Outcome
The Committee reviewed the 2021 bonus plan outcome for Rentokil Initial’s senior management population
based on the targets set at the start of the financial year. The bonus plan supports delivery of Rentokil
based on the targets set at the start of the financial year. The bonus plan supports delivery of Rentokil
Initial’s strategic priorities.
301 • 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The annual bonus plan comprises three parts: gateway measures, company performance and personal
performance. This means that bonuses earned reflect the performance of the constituent businesses which
make up the overall company performance as well as achievement against specific personal objectives. The
gateway measures and company performance are measured against financial targets. The Executive Directors
had a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary if Rentokil Initial’s financial targets are achieved in full
and an opportunity to earn up to 30% based on personal performance, which is measured through Rentokil
Initial’s performance and development review process. In total, the maximum bonus opportunity is up to
180% of salary.
Application of Discretion
The Committee has not applied discretion to the outcome of the annual bonus as the outcome is felt fair in
the context of Rentokil Initial’s performance and experience of wider stakeholders. The table below details
the key achievements for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, which were used to determine their
performance rating.
Gateway Measures
For any bonus to be payable to an Executive Director, two gateway measures had to be met as follows:
Profit Gateway: Rentokil Initial must achieve at least 95% of the ongoing operating profit target of
£431.5m, which is £409.9m. The outcome was £469.0m.
Free Cash Flow Gateway: Rentokil Initial must achieve free cash flow generation of £205m. The outcome
was £331.5m.
Both gateways were achieved for 2021.
Company Performance Measures
Executive Directors’ bonuses were determined by achievement against two independent financial measures:
ongoing revenue and ongoing operating profit (before restructuring costs) performance. These measures
were given equal weighting.
The targets used to assess ongoing revenue performance are disclosed below, along with the achievement
against these targets, which was calculated on the same basis as the targets were set.

2019 PSP Vesting Level
The following table summarises the outcomes for each of the performance conditions applicable to the 2019
PSP Awards. The Committee has not applied discretion to the outcome of the vesting as the outcome is felt
fair in the context of Rentokil Initial performance and experience of wider stakeholders over the three-year
performance period.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and between target and maximum, with the
exception of TSR. No shares will vest if the performance is below the threshold for that measure. For the
TSR, vesting is on a straight-line basis between median and upper quartile performance. The TSR
performance period for the 2019 PSP Award is measured over a three-year period ending during the 2022
financial year.

price at grant of 346.6p), which is 34.2% of the PSP value. The Committee has not exercised discretion as a
result of this share price appreciation.

Stuart Ingall-Tombs was appointed to the Rentokil Initial board of directors on August 15, 2020. His PSP
award was granted prior to his appointment as an Executive Director and, in line with the reporting
requirements, the value has been pro-rated to reflect his qualifying earnings as an Executive Director.
PSP Awards Granted During 2021
In 2021, Andy Ransom and Stuart Ingall-Tombs were granted an award of shares under the PSP totalling
325% and 200% of salary, respectively. Andy Ransom received an award of 250% of salary in March 2021 and
a further 75% in May 2021 following the approval of the Policy. The application of the new Policy was
phased as agreed with shareholders. The awards are subject to a three-year performance period and a two-
year holding period post vesting. These awards will vest after a period of three years with no further
performance conditions.
The number of shares that vest under the PSP will be based on the following performance conditions and
weightings:

Targets for these measures have not been disclosed as 
the Rentokil Initial board of directors believes that these 
measures are commercially sensitive. They will be 
based on straight-line vesting between threshold and 
target and between target and maximum performance 
which will be reported at vesting.
Of maximum opportunity.
In addition, when determining the level of vesting, the Committee will also consider the underlying financial
performance of the business, as well as the value added for shareholders during the performance periods,
and may adjust the vesting outcome if it considers this to be appropriate.

The figures shown for the number of share awards are maximum entitlements and the actual number of
shares (if any) which vest under the PSP will depend on the performance conditions being achieved as
set out above.
The share price is the closing price of a Rentokil Initial ordinary share the day prior to grant.
The awards granted were in the form of nil-cost options and may be exercised after vesting up to 10
years from the date of grant.
The TSR condition for the March award will be measured over three years to March 22, 2024 and to May
17, 2024 for the May award. The other performance conditions will be measured over three years to
December 31, 2023. The 2021 PSP Awards are subject to a holding period of two years which commences
from the date of vest.
DBP awards granted during the year
Due to the Executive Directors forfeiting their annual bonus in 2020, no grants were awarded under the DBP
in 2021.
Payments for loss of office
There were no payments made to Directors for loss of office during 2021.
Payments to Past Directors
Jeremy Townsend retired from the Rentokil Initial board of directors with effect from August 14, 2020. He was
treated as a good leaver, which is the automatic treatment for retirement and which the Committee agreed was
appropriate to apply. His leaving terms were in line with Rentokil Initial’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy in
force at the time. No discretion was applied by the Committee to his leaving arrangements. Under these
arrangements the following payments were made that relate to 2021, as a result of the 2018 PSP award vesting
on March 29, 2021. This award is subject to a further two-year holding period.

Proposed Share Plans
The following paragraphs set out a description of the principal terms of the following plans, which, subject
to approval by the shareholders of Rentokil Initial, will be adopted by Renotkil Initial, effective upon the
closing date of the merger.
Stock Incentive Plan
The Stock Incentive Plan will govern awards of stock options originally made under Terminix’s Stock
Incentive Plan which are assumed by Rentokil Initial pursuant to the merger agreement. Rentokil Initial
ordinary shares to be issued under the Stock Incentive Plan will equal the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares needed upon settlement of such assumed options. No further awards will be granted under the plan.
For more information regarding the assumption of Terminix equity awards, see the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Terminix Equity Awards” beginning on
page 139.

Omnibus Incentive Plan
The Omnibus Incentive Plan will govern equity awards originally made under Terminix’s 2014 Omnibus
Incentive Plan which are assumed by Rentokil Initial pursuant to the merger agreement. For more information
regarding the assumption of Terminix equity awards, see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Terminix Equity Awards” beginning on page 139. In addition,
Rentokil Initial may grant further awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan during the 12-month period
following the closing date of the merger for purposes of satisfying its obligations under Section 7.05(a) of
the merger agreement, in such forms and subject to such individual limits as Rentokil Initial may determine
from time to time. Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will equal
the number of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares needed upon settlement of suchassumed awards, plus any
future awards granted in accordance with the limitations set forth below.
Rentokil Initial will not grant awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan if such grant would cause the number
of Rentokil Initial ADSs and Rentokil Initial ordinary shares that could be issued under the plan or any other
share plan adopted by Rentokil Initial or any other company under Rentokil Initial’s control to exceed 10
percent of the issued share capital in any rolling 10-year period. In addition, Rentokil Initial will not grant
awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan if such grant would cause the number of Rentokil Initial ADSs and
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares that could be issued under the plan or any discretionary share plans adopted
by Rentokil Initial or any other company under Rentokil Initial’s control to exceed five per cent, of the issued
share capital in any rolling 10-year period. Rentokil Initial ADSs and Renotkil Initial ordinary shares in
respect of the assumed awards will be disregarded for the purpose of calculating these dilution limits.

Rentokil Initial ordinary shares held by Andy Ransom under the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018
PSP awards are vested but unexercised and total 4,740,141. Stuart Ingall-Tombs did not hold any vested,
but unexercised options.
The 2018 PSP award is entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares based on dividend payments between the date of grant and vesting. These are included in the
total shares at vest. The awards granted prior to 2021 are also entitled to receive dividend equivalents in
the form of shares post vest based on dividend payments between the date of vest and the date one
month before exercise. These shares are applied at exercise.
The 2018 PSP award partially vested at 85.97%.
The 2017, 2018 and 2019 awards for Stuart Ingall-Tombs were made prior to his appointment as an
Executive Director. The awards were granted as conditional shares that are automatically exercised on
vesting. Part of the 2018 and 2019 awards are subject to the achievement of North America specific
targets related to revenue and profit margin growth and the shares for this element have been prorated
for his CFO North America role.
The 2019, 2020 and 2022 DBP awards have no additional performance conditions beyond the three-year
holding period.
The awards granted were in the form of nil-cost options and may be exercised after vesting up to 10
years from the date of grant, with the exception of awards granted to Stuart Ingall-Tombs in 2018 and
2019, these awards were granted as conditional awards and will automatically be exercised on vest.
Andy Ransom exercised his 2012 PSP award on August 16, 2021, the shares had nil cost and the market
value on the day was 560.01p.
Stuart Ingall-Tombs exercised his 2018 award on September 6, 2021, the shares had nil cost and the
market value was 582.92p.

Wider Workforce Policy
During 2021, Rentokil Initial had approximately 46,000 colleagues based in 88 countries. Rentokil Initial has a
broad remuneration policy which reflects the diversity of cultures, legislative environments, employment
markets and the types and seniority of roles that this geographic spread requires. Rentokil Initial structures
its employee reward to enable us to recruit and retain the right people, doing the right job for its customers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rentokil Initial believes that its relationship with its colleagues is generally good, as evidenced by its high
engagement scores. The majority of Rentokil Initial’s colleagues are not represented by any labor union.
However, labor agreements are common in some countries around the world and Rentokil Initial recognises
such arrangements and works closely with the applicable work councils. Rentokil Initial recognises unions
and/or follows Collective Labour Agreements in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Turkey, Austria,
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Guadeloupe, Martenique, Eswatini, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and India. These agreements are typically
national agreements and cover blue collar workers. Rentokil Initial has not experienced any strike action that
significantly influenced its business activities.
CEO Pay Ratio
The CEO pay ratio compares Rentokil Initial’s Chief Executive’s single figure earnings to the single figure
earnings of UK colleagues. It has been calculated using method A, where the colleagues at each quartile are
identified using details of their full-time equivalent pay and benefits for the year being measured. The
effective date for the calculation is the December 31 of the reporting year. For example, the 2021 colleague
figures represent the full-time equivalent pay and benefits for 2021 for colleagues employed on December 31,
2021 and is calculated once the actual data is available, which means that no elements of pay are omitted or
departures required from the methodology. This method was chosen as it best replicates the Chief
Executive’s single figure.
The table below shows the ratios at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile for 2021, 2020, 2019 and
2018:

The ratios are significantly higher in 2021 than 2020. There are three key reasons:
the Chief Executive’s pay has returned to normal levels following 2020 in which he received no bonus,
a lower PSP vesting level and waived his salary in Q2 2020;
the acquisition of the Cannon Hygiene business has increased the number of hygiene technicians,
which has reduced the pay of Rentokil Initial’s benchmark colleagues; and
price per Rentokil Initial ordinary share has risen 90% between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2021,
which means the PSP element of the CEO’s package has significantly increased in value over this
time, due to share price appreciation.
It is anticipated that variations in the PSP and annual bonus outcomes will have the biggest impact on the
ratios over time. For PSP, this is due to vesting levels and the share price changing. For the annual bonus,
although Rentokil Initial’s comparator colleagues are also eligible for a bonus, the Chief Executive is targeted
on company-level outcomes, whereas its comparator colleagues are based on their specific remit, which
given that the UK makes up only a small percentage of the company, means the outcomes may vary from
year to year.
The median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for Rentokil Initial’s UK
colleagues taken as a whole. Rentokil Initial has a consistent approach to reward across the Rentokil Initial
group, and colleagues’ packages are set with reference to the external market.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Gender Pay Gap
Rentokil Initial continues to have no material gender pay gap between men and women, with a median of -4%
and a mean -8%, which is significantly better than the UK average of 15.4% reported by the Office for
National Statistics, and means the median woman earns more than the equivalent man.
These are encouraging results overall, and Rentokil Initial is steadily increasing the number of women in
senior roles. In addition, Rentokil Initial’s reputation as an Employer of Choice has continued to grow with a
significant number of female external hires.
Rentokil Initial continues to be focused on making Rentokil Initial an even more diverse and inclusive place
to work and in 2021 rolled out a global diversity, equality and inclusion upskilling programme for all middle
and senior management across the world, covering around 1,000 employees.
Rentokil Initial’s key areas of focus continue to be increasing the number of female frontline technicians and
improving the proportion of females in senior manager roles in both its head office functions and its
operations.
Relative Importance of Spend on Pay

The average number of people employed by Rentokil Initial during the year was 46,031 in 2021 and
44,588 in 2020.
Percentage Change in Remuneration
The table below sets out a comparison of the change in pay versus the previous year for the Chief Executive,
Chief Financial Officer, Chairman, Non-Executive Directors and colleagues of Rentokil Initial for 2020 and
2021.
The percentage changes calculated on the actual remuneration received are distorted by two factors: firstly,
initiatives undertaken in 2020 to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, such as pay waivers in Q2 2020 and
cancelling the annual bonus scheme, have impacted the percentage changes; and secondly, the actual
remuneration received is not adjusted for in-year starters and leavers.
To give a clearer picture, a “‘like for like’” comparison has also been included, which includes adjustments to
correct the above distortions; for example, by removing the impact of the pay waivers from base salary.
However, the bonus payments are still impacted by COVID-19.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Operation
Base salaries are payable in cash and are normally reviewed annually. Base
salaries are set taking into account:
scope and responsibilities of the role;
external economic environment;
individual skills and experience;
contribution to overall business performance;
pay conditions for other colleagues based in the UK and other regions which
are considered by the Committee to be relevant for that executive; and
comparable salaries in a cross-section of companies of a similar size and
complexity at the time of review - which will be taken into consideration, but
not be the key determiner of salary levels.
Levels of payout
Base salaries are set at an appropriate level taking into account the factors
described under “Operation” above and salary increases are considered in this
context.
While there is no maximum salary level, the Committee would normally expect
percentage pay increases for the Executive Directors to be broadly in line with
the wider workforce in relevant regions. However, higher increases may be
awarded in certain circumstances, where the Committee considers this
appropriate, such as:
where a new Executive Director has been appointed to the Rentokil Initial
board of directors at a lower than typical market salary to allow for growth in
the role, then larger increases may be awarded in following years to move
salary positioning closer to typical market levels as the executive grows in
experience, subject to performance;
where the Executive Director has been promoted or has had a change in
responsibilities, salary increases in excess of the above level may be
awarded; or
a substantial change in Rentokil Initial’s size or market capitalisation leading
to the positioning of an Executive Director’s salary falling behind market
practice.
In exceptional circumstances, where a Non-Executive Director temporarily takes
up an executive position, salary increases for the Non-Executive Director may
be awarded as appropriate.
Performance measures and
period
The payment of salary is not dependent on achieving performance targets
although individual performance is taken into account when setting salary
levels and determining any salary increases.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Pension
Purpose/link to strategy
To facilitate Executive Directors’ planning for retirement.
Operation
Executive Director pension arrangements are by way of a defined contribution
arrangement or through a cash alternative of a similar value or a combination of
the two.
Levels of payout
For the current Chief Financial Officer and any future Executive Director hires
the maximum contribution will be in line with the wider workforce in the UK,
which is currently 3% of base salary although this rate may change from time to
time.
The maximum contribution for the Chief Executive has been frozen at the cash
amount paid in 2019, when the Policy in force at the time was 25% of salary and
is currently equivalent to 21.9% of base salary. This cash amount will be
reduced to be in line with the maximum contribution for the wider workforce in
the UK at the end of 2022.
Performance measures and
period
Not applicable.
Benefits
Purpose/link to strategy
To provide market-competitive benefits that support the executive to undertake
their role.
Operation
Rentokil Initial pays the cost of providing the benefits on a monthly, annual or
one-off basis. Benefits are determined taking into account market practice, the
level and type of benefits provided throughout the Rentokil Initial group and
individual circumstances. All benefits are non-pensionable. The main benefits
for Executive Directors are:
life assurance;
car or car allowance;
family healthcare;
permanent health insurance; and
relocation benefits - in the event that an executive were required to relocate
to undertake their role, the Committee may provide an additional appropriate
level of benefits to reflect the relevant circumstances. Such benefits may be
one-off or ongoing in nature.
Should an Executive Director be appointed in a country other than the UK,
benefits appropriate to that market would be considered. The Committee retains
the discretion to change the benefits provided (including offering additional
benefits) in line with market practice and may include offering participation in
any future all employee share plan.
Levels of payout
Levels of benefits are set in line with market practice. The level of benefits
provided varies year on year depending on the cost of the provision of benefits
to Rentokil Initial and therefore it is not meaningful to identify a maximum level
of benefits.
Performance measures and
period
Not applicable.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Annual bonus
Purpose/link to strategy
To recognise and reward for stretching business performance against annual
financial targets and/or personal objectives that contribute to Rentokil Initial
performance.
To attract and retain executives of the calibre required to implement Rentokil
Initial’s strategy and drive business performance.
The deferral of an element of the annual bonus into Rentokil Initial ordinary
shares provides alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests following the
successful delivery of short-term targets and supports the balance of
achievement of short-term and long-term business performance.
Operation
The annual bonus is paid each year after the Committee has reviewed
performance against targets, which are set around the beginning of each year
for each Executive Director, taking into consideration the underlying
performance of the business.
Normally no more than 60% of any bonus is generally paid in cash with the
balance deferred in Rentokil Initial ordinary shares under the Deferred Bonus
Plan (DBP).
Deferred shares typically vest after a period of three years with no further
performance conditions.
Shares awarded under the DBP are typically awarded as nil-cost options and
have an exercise period that extends from the date of vesting to the tenth
anniversary of the award being made although awards may be structured in
other ways. If nil-cost options remain exercisable at the tenth anniversary of
grant then they will be exercised automatically on a participant’s behalf.
The Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the level of
bonus payable is appropriate and a fair reflection of Rentokil Initial’s
performance.
Malus and clawback rules apply to both cash bonus payments and DBP awards
(see Malus and Clawback section for details).
Deferred shares may be adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a
variation of Rentokil Initial’s share capital, demerger, special dividend or similar
event that materially affects the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.
Levels of payout
Bonus payouts start to accrue at a level of up to 20% of base salary for meeting
threshold levels of performance and a maximum opportunity of 180% of base
salary, with an on-target bonus opportunity of no more than 50% of the
maximum opportunity. Payouts for performance levels in between these levels
will typically be paid on a straight-line basis.
Dividend equivalents accrue between grant date and vesting date on shares
that vest under the DBP and are normally settled in the form of additional
shares.
Performance measures and
period
The annual bonus is normally based on the achievement of financial targets
and/or personal objectives, although the Committee may include other strategic
priorities. Performance is typically tested over a one-year performance period.
The Committee reserves the right to set appropriate measures that ensure

financial measures accounting for at least 75% of the total.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Purpose/link to strategy
To motivate and incentivise delivery of stretching business performance over
the long term and to create alignment with growth in value for shareholders.
To act as a retention tool for Executive Directors.
Operation
The PSP operates under the rules approved by shareholders in 2016 (and as
amended).
An award of shares is granted on an annual basis with a face value in line with
the multiple of base salary approved by the Committee, with vesting subject to
the achievement of performance conditions.
Shares awarded under the PSP are typically awarded as nil-cost options
(although may be structured in other ways) and have an exercise period that
extends from the date of vesting to the tenth anniversary of the award being
made. If nil-cost options remain exercisable at the tenth anniversary of grant
then they will be exercised automatically on a participant’s behalf.
Award levels and performance conditions are set to support the business’ long-
term goals and seek to reflect market practice and shareholder guidance.
Awards are subject to a two-year holding period post vesting. Directors may
sell sufficient shares to pay taxes due related to the award, if required, during
this period.
Malus and clawback rules apply to shares awarded under the PSP (see Malus
and Clawback section for details).
Awards may be adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a variation
of Rentokil’s share capital, demerger, special dividend or similar event that
materially affects the price of Rentokil Initial ordinary shares.
Levels of payout
The maximum regular annual award will be 375% of base salary for the Chief
Executive and 300% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer and any other
Executive Directors. This increase in award will be implemented on a phased
basis, with the CEO receiving 325% of salary (75% of salary increase) in the
year ending December 31, 2021 (Year 1). The CFO will receive an award of 200%
of salary (this remains at the current level) in Year 1, while he settles into the
role and gains experience. No more than 20% of the award shall vest for meeting
threshold levels of performance and 100% of the award shall vest if maximum
performance is achieved. Performance between these points will typically be
measured on a straight-line basis.
Dividend equivalents may accrue between grant date and vesting date or to the
end of the holding period on shares that vest under the PSP and are normally
settled in the form of additional shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Performance measures and
period
Awards are subject to the achievement of financial and ESG/strategic measures,
with specific measures and weightings set by the Committee each year to
ensure alignment with the business strategy at the time of grant. However, a
minimum weighting of 75% should relate to financial (including TSR) measures.
Potential measures include:
relative TSR performance;
organic revenue growth;
free cash flow conversion; and
ESG measures (employee retention, customer satisfaction and vehicle fuel
intensity).
If events happen which cause the Committee to consider that a performance
condition would not, without alteration, achieve its original purpose, it may
amend that performance condition provided that the amended performance
condition is materially no less challenging than it would have been had the
event not occurred.
The Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the
formulaic vesting outcome is appropriate and a fair reflection of Rentokil
Initial’s performance.
Shareholding guidelines
Purpose/link to strategy
Encourages greater levels of shareholding and aligns Executive Directors’
interests with those of shareholders.
Operation
Executive Directors are expected to achieve and maintain a holding of Rentokil
Initial ordinary shares.
A further post-cessation shareholding requirement will normally apply to
Executive Directors (see Termination section for details). For two years
following cessation of employment, Executive Directors will be required to hold
Rentokil Initial ordinary shares to the value of the shareholding guideline that
applied at the cessation of their employment unless the Committee exceptionally
determines otherwise; or, in cases where the individual has not had sufficient
time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of shareholding
at cessation.
Levels of holding
Chief Executive: 300% of salary, Chief Financial Officer and other Executive
Directors: 200% of salary. To be achieved within five years of appointment or
other significant event.
Performance measures and
period
Not applicable.
Measures and Targets
All the performance measures selected, both in the financial and ESG/strategic categories, support the
delivery of short-term and long-term financial performance of Rentokil Initial’s business and shareholder
value creation. Targets are set each year based on stretching internal budgets and achieving or exceeding
these targets will both return value to shareholders and reward the executive team for delivery.
The annual bonus measures are reviewed annually to focus on delivery of key financial targets and strategic
goals for the forthcoming year, as well as key strategic or operational goals relevant to the individual. Over
the long term, PSP performance measures are focused on generating returns to shareholders through the
relative TSR measure and other measures focus on improving business performance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Malus and Clawback
Malus and clawback rules apply to the Executive Directors’ incentive arrangements. Under these provisions,
the Committee at its discretion may reduce bonus payments in respect of the current year or future years and
have the ability to scale back awards that have not yet vested under Rentokil Initial’s PSP or DBP
(potentially to nil) in the event of:
a material misstatement of Rentokil Initial’s audited results for the current year or prior years;
actions which result in serious reputational damage or corporate failure affecting any part of the
Rentokil Initial group, which can be reasonably attributed to be the result of an individual’s serious
misconduct;
the discovery that an assessment of performance connected to the award (including relating to the
original bonus amount for the DBP) was based on misleading or inaccurate information;
there has been fraud or gross misconduct, or circumstances which, in the opinion of the Committee,
would entitle Rentokil Initial or any other member of the Rentokil Initial group to summarily dismiss
the individual; or
in other circumstances where the Committee, in its discretion, considers that this treatment is
appropriate.
For bonus, a clawback provision exists to give the Committee, in the same circumstances to malus, the ability
to recover sums already paid for up to two years after bonus determination.
For PSP, a clawback provision exists to give the Committee, in the same circumstances as malus, the ability to
recover sums already paid for up to five years from the grant date.
Use of Discretion
The Committee is cognisant of its responsibility to make informed and thoughtful decisions on remuneration
that are both balanced and in the long-term interests of the business and shareholders and, where necessary,
will apply discretion to remuneration targets or outcomes that would otherwise be inappropriate.
In addition, the Committee also retains the right to apply discretion in the operation and administration of
Rentokil Initial incentive plans. This includes, but is not limited to, the following areas: setting appropriate
performance conditions, weightings and targets from year to year for the PSP and annual bonus; the timing
of PSP and DBP grants; the timing of annual bonus payments; the size of PSP awards granted; and
determining the treatment of leavers.
Any discretion applied will be in accordance with the respective plan rules (or relevant documentation) and
within the limits of the Policy.
Directors’ Service Agreements - Executive Directors
Executive Directors are employed on permanent contracts which are terminable on 12 months’ notice by
either party. A description of the payment in lieu of notice provisions can be found below. Rentokil Initial’s
policy in respect of the notice periods for the termination of Executive Directors’ contracts conforms to the
UK Corporate Governance Code. The remuneration and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors
and senior management do not contain any matters that are required to be disclosed under the Takeover
Directive. The contracts of service for Executive Directors are available for inspection by shareholders at
Rentokil Initial’s registered office.
Termination
When an Executive Director leaves the business on the basis of mutual agreement, the Committee will
determine an appropriate payment, taking into account the circumstances of leaving, but any payment will be
no more generous than that for leavers by reason of disability, ill health, retirement, redundancy, death or
sale of an individual employing business. There are no provisions for notice periods or compensation in

the event of the termination of the appointment of a Non-Executive Director. The Chair of the Rentokil Initial
board of directors has a notice period of six months.
Base Pay and Benefits
Executive Directors are entitled to a payment in lieu of notice equal to base pay and the value of benefits
only for the duration of the remaining notice period, subject to mitigation. Rentokil Initial has the ability to
terminate Executive Directors’ employment, in the event of a prolonged mental or physical incapacity to carry
out his/her company duties and without notice (summary dismissal), in the event of gross misconduct or
being disqualified to act as a Director. Appropriate medical benefits may still be provided in the case of
prolonged mental or physical incapacity.
Other
Executive Directors may be entitled to other payments including, but not limited to, costs of appropriate
repatriation/relocation, outplacement, settlement agreement, non-compete agreement, legal and/or tax and
other relevant professional costs. The Committee would look to ensure that the level of these costs/benefits
was reasonable and in the best interests of shareholders.
Bonus, Including Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) Cash Bonus
In the event of retirement, death, disability, redundancy, change of control, sale of the employing company
or any other circumstance at the discretion of the Committee, Executive Directors may receive a bonus
payment for the year in which they cease employment. This payment will normally be pro-rated for time and
performance; however, the Committee retains the discretion to review overall business and individual
performance and determine that a different level of bonus payment is appropriate.
Otherwise, generally, Executive Directors must be employed at the date of payment to receive a bonus. In
certain circumstances, the Committee may determine that a bonus payment may be due to reflect performance
and contribution to the point of cessation.
Deferred bonus shares under the DBP will normally vest in full following completion of the three-year
vesting period, unless the Committee determines in its absolute discretion that vesting will be accelerated.
Participants will have six months from the date of vest to exercise. The vesting of awards will be accelerated
in the event of death and there will be a period of 12 months from death to exercise (or up to 24 months if the
Committee so determines).
The Executive Director will normally have six months in which to exercise their vested awards from the date
of leaving (12 months for death (or up to 24 months if the Committee so determines)).
Performance Share Plan
In the event of ill health, disability, death, retirement, redundancy, change of control, sale of the employing
company or any other circumstance at the discretion of the Committee, awards will vest on the original
vesting date on a time-apportioned basis (unless the Committee determines otherwise). Performance will be
measured at the end of the original performance period. Participants will have six months from the end of the
holding period to exercise. At the Committee’s discretion in the event of ill health, disability or death (or in
the event of any other exceptional circumstance if it determines), awards can vest early on a time-
apportioned basis. In this circumstance, performance will be measured to the early vesting date. If
participants leave for any other reason before the end of the performance period, their award will lapse on
termination.
Participants will have six months from leaving to exercise (12 months for death (or up to 24 months if the
Committee so determines)).
Any PSP awards in the two-year holding period after vesting will be available to exercise following
completion of the two-year holding period. Participants will have six months from the latest of the end of the
holding period or the leaving date to exercise (12 months for death (or up to 24 months if the Committee so
determines)).

If Rentokil Initial is taken over or wound up, PSP awards may vest by reference to the extent to which the
performance conditions are met and on a time pro-rated basis (calculated on a monthly basis) unless, in the
case of pro-rating, the Committee decides otherwise. Outstanding PSP awards may be vested automatically
on a change of control on the participants’ behalf. Typically, salaries and bonuses will be paid to the date of
the change of control.
DBP awards will vest in full on a change of control. If participants are offered, and consent to, an equivalent
award in the new company, they will not vest and instead will be exchanged for a new award. Participants
have one month from the change of control date to exercise their award; any options that are not exercised at
the end of that period will be automatically exercised.

requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by
delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Rentokil Initial plc
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rentokil Initial plc and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement
for the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended in conformity with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impairment assessment of goodwill
As described in Note B2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recorded £1,844.2 million of
goodwill at 31 December 2021. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit. The
recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow
projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are based on
financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group’s normal planning
process. Cash flows for years two to five use management’s expectation of sales growth, operating costs and
margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for

The Board of Directors 
Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. 
150 Peabody Place 
Memphis, Tennessee 38103
Dear Members of the Board:
We understand that Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Rentokil Initial
plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“Parent”), Rentokil Initial
US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Bidco”), Leto Holdings
I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco (“Merger Sub I”), Leto
Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco,
propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which Parent will
acquire the Company (the “Transaction”). Pursuant to the Agreement, Merger Sub I will be merged with and
into the Company (the “First Merger”) and each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the
Agreement) (such holders, in their capacity as holders of such shares, collectively, “Excluded Holders”), will
be converted into the right to receive, at the option of the holder of Company Common Stock and subject to
certain limitations and proration procedures set forth in the Agreement (as to which we express no opinion),
(x) a number of American depositary shares of Parent (“Parent ADS”) representing a beneficial interest in five
ordinary shares (“Parent Ordinary Shares”), par value £0.01 per share, of Parent equal to (A) 1.0619 (the
“Exchange Ratio”) plus (B) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of $11.00 (the “Per Share Cash
Amount”) and the Parent ADS Price (as defined in the Agreement) (the “Stock Election Consideration”) or
(y) in cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Amount plus (B) the
product of the Exchange Ratio and the Parent ADS Price (the “Cash Election Consideration” and together
with the Stock Election Consideration, the “Consideration”). Immediately following the First Merger, the
surviving corporation of the First Merger shall be merged with and into Merger Sub II with Merger Sub II as
the surviving company as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Bidco. The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as of the date hereof as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) of the Consideration to be paid to such
holders in the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have:
Reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 13, 2021 of the Agreement;
Reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the
Company and Parent;
Reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to us by the Company relating to
the business of the Company, publicly available financial forecasts and other data relating to the
business of Parent and extrapolations thereto based on publicly available guidance from Parent
(the “Parent Public Forecasts”) and the projected synergies and other benefits, including the
amount and timing thereof, anticipated by the managements of the Company to be realized from
the Transaction;
Held discussions with (x) members of the senior management of the Company with respect to the
businesses and prospects of the Company and Parent and the projected synergies and other
benefits anticipated by the management of the Company to be realized from the Transaction and
(y) representatives of Parent with respect to the business and prospects of Parent;
Reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business we
believe to be generally relevant in evaluating the businesses of the Company and Parent,
respectively;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of
business we believe to be generally relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;
Reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Company Common Stock and Parent
Ordinary Shares;
Reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the Transaction on Parent based on the
financial forecasts referred to above relating to the Company and Parent; and
Conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without
independent verification of such information. We have not conducted any independent valuation or
appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Parent or concerning
the solvency or fair value of the Company or Parent, and we have not been furnished with any such
valuation or appraisal. As you are aware, we have not been provided with, and did not have access to,
financial forecasts relating to Parent prepared by the management of Parent. Accordingly, we have been
advised by the Company and have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Parent Public
Forecasts are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of Parent and, at
the direction of the Company, we have relied on the Parent Public Forecasts for purposes of our financial
analyses in connection with this opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in our analyses,
including those related to projected synergies and other benefits anticipated by the managements of the
Company to be realized from the Transaction, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they
have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as
to the future financial performance of the Company and Parent, respectively, and to such synergies and other
benefits. We assume no responsibility for and express no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions
on which they are based, including with respect to the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on such
forecasts or assumptions.
Further, our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We assume no responsibility for updating or
revising our opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof. We further note that
volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets relating to, among others, the COVID-19
pandemic, may or may not have an effect on the Company and Parent and we are not expressing an opinion
as to the effects of such volatility or such disruption on the Company or Parent. We do not express any
opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common Stock, Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares
may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the Transaction. In connection with our
engagement, we were authorized to solicit indications of interest regarding a potential transaction with the
Company from a limited number of third parties. In addition, our opinion does not address the relative merits
of the Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might
engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Transaction will be
consummated on the terms described in the Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material
terms or conditions. Representatives of the Company have advised us, and we have assumed, that the
Agreement, when executed, will conform to the drafts reviewed by us in all material respects. We also have
assumed, with the consent of the Company, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third
party approvals and consents for the Transaction will not have an adverse effect on the Company, Parent or
the Transaction. We further have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Transaction will
qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other
consequences that might result from the Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory
or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed
necessary from qualified professionals. We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects
(other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein) of the Transaction, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any agreements or arrangements entered into in
connection with, or contemplated by, the Transaction. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the

fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the
Consideration or otherwise.
Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) is acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the
Transaction and will receive a fee for such services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this
opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Transaction. We in the past
have provided certain investment banking services to the Company, for which we have received
compensation, including, during the past two years, having advised the Company in the sale of
ServiceMaster Brands. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade
securities of the Company, Parent and certain of their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the
accounts of their customers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also
trade and hold securities on behalf of the Company, Parent and certain of their respective affiliates. The
issuance of this opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of Lazard.
Our engagement and the opinion expressed herein are for the benefit of the Board of Directors of the
Company (in its capacity as such) and our opinion is rendered to the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with its evaluation of the Transaction. Our opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the
Transaction or any matter relating thereto.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to
be paid to holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) in the Transaction is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,

Annex C​
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
SECTION 262 APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds
such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor
consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant
by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected
pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof,
at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting
of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a
merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of
merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more
than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any
shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §
251(f) of this title.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the
holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation
pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such
stock anything except:
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or
consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;
Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof,
which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts
at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national
securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of
fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs
(b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.
In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected
under § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger,
appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
[Repealed]
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its
certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this
section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less
than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available
pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or
all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of
this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §
114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a
demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an
information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice.
Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute
such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of
or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has
become effective; or
If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of
this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify
each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal
rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice
may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also
notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the
date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the
corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if
any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each
such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the
merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that is entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger
or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice
to all such holders on or
C-2 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is
sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first
notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this
subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation
may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed
and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding
as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled
to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded
stock (as defined in § 251 (h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and
accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251 (h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a
statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value
of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The
Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing
of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices
by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit
C-3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class
or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a
national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who
are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds
1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger
was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall
accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled
to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each
such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.
The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether
such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.
(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion
of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation
a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in
subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of
such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal

would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Rentokil Initial plc
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rentokil Initial plc and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement
for the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended in conformity with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impairment assessment of goodwill
As described in Note B2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recorded £1,844.2 million of
goodwill at 31 December 2021. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit. The
recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow
projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are based on
financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group’s normal planning
process. Cash flows for years two to five use management’s expectation of sales growth, operating costs and
margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for
F-2 TABLE OF CONTENTS
each CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates
(LTGR). Management’s key assumptions in the recoverable amount calculation are LTGR, terminal operating
margin and pre-tax discount rate.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment
assessment for goodwill is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment from management when
developing the recoverable amount of the CGUs, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity,
complexity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related
to terminal operating margins (including sales growth, operating costs and margin), the LTGR and pre-tax
discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialised skill and
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among
others (i) testing management’s process for developing the recoverable amount; (ii) evaluating the
appropriateness of the recoverable amount calculation; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of
underlying data; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management
relating to the sales growth, operating costs and margin, LTGR and pre-tax discount rate. Evaluating
management’s assumptions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were
reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the CGU; (ii) the consistency with external
market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in
other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in the
evaluation of the management’s recoverable amount calculation and the pre-tax discount rate assumption.
Valuation of customer lists and other intangible assets acquired in the year
As described in Note B1 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended 31 December 2021
the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets of 52 companies and businesses for a
total consideration of £313.7 million. Goodwill of £230.6 million and customer lists and other intangible assets
totaling £70.7 million were recorded. Customer lists and other intangible assets are recognised at their fair
value at the date of acquisition using an income-based approach, which involves the use of assumptions
including customer termination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates. The use
of these assumptions requires estimation in the valuation approach.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of
customer lists and other intangible assets acquired in the year is a critical audit matter are: (i) significant
judgment by management in determining the fair values; (ii) a high level of auditor judgment, subjectivity,
and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to
customer termination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates; and (iii) the audit
effort involved the use of professionals with specialised skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among
others (i) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of intangible assets; (ii) evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by
management; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to customer
termination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges and the discount rate for the intangible assets.
Professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discount
rates.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations
As described in Note A10 to the consolidated financial statements, at 31 December 2021, the UK Rentokil
Initial 2015 Pension Scheme (RIPS) has a surplus of £18.2 million, comprising defined benefit obligations of
£1,247.5 million and plan assets of £1,265.7 million. The principal pension scheme in the Group is the RIPS
which has a defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to
new entrants and future accrual of benefits. The defined benefit schemes of the RIPS are reappraised semi-
annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance
F-3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
with IAS 19R requirements (including schemes which are insured under a buy-in contract). The assumptions
used for the RIPS are discount rate, future salary increases, future pension increases, RPI inflation, CPI
inflation and mortality rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of
retirement benefit obligations is a critical audit matter are: (i) significant judgment by management in
developing the estimate; (ii) a high level of subjectivity and effort in evaluating the significant assumptions
underlying the position at year-end; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with
specialised skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among
others, (i) testing management’s process for calculating the RIPS defined benefit obligations and (ii)
evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to mortality assumptions, discount rates,
inflation rates, future salary increases and future pension increases. Professionals with specialised skill and
knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of these assumptions.

Both cash and cash equivalents and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020
by reducing cash in hand and overdrafts by £276.1m to reflect a correction in presentation by netting
position of the main and shadow bank accounts pool arrangement which were previously grossed up
(Note C2 and C3).
Trade and other receivables and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020 due
to a correction of the recognition of an overseas factoring arrangement. Both have been increased by
£21.0m.

reclassified in 2019 and 2020 to improve the presentation in other comprehensive income. Previously
this was presented in 2020 as a net loss of £52.6m (2019: £38.9m) classified as net exchange adjustments
offset in reserves.
£13.2m net gain on cash flow hedge includes £14.4m loss (2020: £15.1m gain) from the effective portion
of changes in fair value offset by reclassification to the income statement of £27.6m loss (2020: £20.0m
gain) due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Shares of £0.1m (2020: £0.1m) have been netted against retained earnings. This represents 9.4m (2020: 7.7m)
shares held by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust. The market value of these shares at 31 December
2021 was £54.9m (2020: £39.0m). Dividend income from, and voting rights on, the shares held by the Trust
have been waived.

Both net exchange adjustments offset in reserves and net loss on net investment hedge have been
reclassified in 2019 and 2020 to improve the presentation in other comprehensive income. Previously
this was presented as a net loss of £52.6m classified as net exchange adjustments offset in reserves.
£13.2m net gain on cash flow hedge includes £14.4m loss (2020: £15.1m gain) from the effective portion
of changes in fair value offset by reclassification to the income statement of £27.6m loss (2020: £20.0m
gain) due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The capital reduction reserve arose in 2005 as a result of the scheme of arrangement of Rentokil Initial 1927
plc, under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985, to introduce a new holding company, Rentokil Initial plc,
and the subsequent reduction in capital approved by the High Court whereby the nominal value of each
ordinary share was reduced from 100p to 1p.
The legal reserve represents amounts set aside in compliance with local laws in certain countries in which
the Group operates. An assessment of this reserve was completed during 2021 and determined that these
amounts are no longer required to be set aside. £10.4m (2020: £nil) has been transferred back to the retained
earnings reserve.

Interest paid includes the interest element of lease payments of £6.1m (2020: £6.8m; 2019: £8.1m).
2019 and 2020 have been restated due to a correction to the presentation of an overseas factoring
arrangement. The restatements were: cash generated from operating activities (2020: £3.2m; 2019
£(0.3)m); proceeds from new debt (2020: £(3.2)m; 2019 £nil); and debt repayments (2020: £nil; 2019
£1.6m).
Purchase of property, plant and equipment (£(1.7)m) and capital element of lease payments (£0.4m) have
been restated in 2019 due to correction of an error in the amount previously reported.

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
General accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), with UK-
adopted International Accounting Standards, and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The transition from EU-adopted International
Accounting Standards to UK-adopted International Accounting Standards has had no impact on
recognition, measurement or disclosure in the period reported as a result of the change in framework. The
Consolidated Financial Statements of Rentokil Initial plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities
(including derivative instruments).
These Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
These Financial Statements as at and for the period ended 31 December 2021 were authorised for issue on 26
May 2022.
Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it (i) has power over the
entity; (ii) is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and (iii) has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it
controls a subsidiary if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of these three
elements of control.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date
that control commences until the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, balances, and gains
and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. When less than 100%
of the issued share capital of a subsidiary is acquired, and the acquisition includes an option to purchase the
remaining share capital of the subsidiary, the anticipated acquisition method is applied where judged
appropriate to do so. The judgement is based on the risks and rewards associated with the option to
purchase, meaning that no non-controlling interest is recognised. A liability is carried on the balance sheet
equal to the fair value of the option to purchase. This is revised to the fair value at each reporting date with
differences being recorded in equity.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any
related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in
the income statement. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is
lost. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling
interests, which may cause the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Consideration in excess of
net identifiable assets acquired in respect of non-controlling interests in existing subsidiary undertakings is
taken directly to reserves.
(b) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence over the financial and operating
policies, but not control. Significant influence is usually presumed to exist when the Group holds between
20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s
investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity
movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date
that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity
accounted investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued
except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on
behalf of an investee.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the associates.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated
Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of Rentokil Initial plc.
(b) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of the balance sheet;
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities,
and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments or deemed to
be quasi-equity, are taken to other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange
differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period-end exchange rates.
(c) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions, or from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at
reporting period end exchange rates, are recognised under the appropriate heading in the income statement;
except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges or where certain intra-group loans are
determined to be quasi-equity (normally not expected to be repaid).
(d) Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies
With effect from 3 August 2021 the Group purchased Boecker Public Health SAL, a company which has
operations in Lebanon and uses the Lebanese pound as its functional currency. The Lebanese economy was
designated as hyperinflationary from September 2020. As a result, application of IAS 29 Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies has been applied for the Lebanese subsidiary, from the date of acquisition.
The IAS 29 rules are applied as follows:
adjustment of the income statement at the end of the reporting period using the change in general
price index;
F-13 
(ii) 
(iii) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing
power caused by inflation form the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date; and
adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate movement
on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency.
The Consumer Price Index for Lebanon has been used for the relevant hyperinflationary adjustments. The
index on the date of acquisition was 514.89 and at 31 December 2021 was 921.40.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the relevant instrument, and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Note C5 of these notes discusses accounting for financial instruments.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were
acquired. At initial recognition the Group carries out a solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) test
and a business model test to establish the classification and measurement of its financial assets. Financial
assets are classified in the following categories:
(a) Amortised cost
Financial assets under this classification are non-derivative financial assets held to collect the contractual
cash flows until maturity and the cash flows are SPPI. Assets measured at amortised cost include trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents (excluding money market funds which are classified as FVTPL)
and other investments.
(b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
These are non-derivative financial assets which can be for sale with cash flows that are SPPI. These assets
are measured at fair value and changes to market values are recognised in other comprehensive income. The
Group has no assets classified under this category.
(c) Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets under this classification are assets that cannot be classified in any of the other categories.
These assets are measured at fair value and changes to market values are recognised in profit and loss.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading (except where they qualify for hedge accounting) and are
held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, provisions, deferred consideration and
borrowings.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and assumptions are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from
these estimates and revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Sensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the relevant notes to the
Financial Statements. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below
(please refer to the notes for further detail):
impairment of goodwill: growth rate and discount rate assumptions and forecast cash flow estimates
(Note B2);
income taxes: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of outflows in relation to tax
provisions; and
retirement benefits: key actuarial assumptions and estimates over future costs of winding up a
scheme (Note A10).
Judgements
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on
the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is included in the following notes:
IFRS 16 length of each lease: whether to include options to extend and/or termination options when
calculating the lease liability (Note B4).
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards that are mandatorily effective for the current year
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these Financial Statements are the same as
those applied in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any
consequential amendments to other standards, with effect from 1 January 2021:
Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases;
Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts; and
Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform phase
2.
The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures of the amounts
recognised in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Consequently, no adjustment has been made
to the comparative financial information at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019.
Certain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been
published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2021 reporting periods and have not been early adopted
by the Group. These standards, amendments or interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on
the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

A. Operating
A1. Revenue recognition and operating segments
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled. All revenue is considered revenue from contracts
with customers as defined by IFRS 15, including job work and sales of goods. Under IFRS 15, revenue is
recognised when a customer obtains control of goods or services in line with identifiable performance
obligations. In the majority of cases the Group considers that the contracts it enters into are contracts for
bundled services which are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, the majority of
revenue across the Group is recognised on an output basis evenly over the course of the contract because
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as it
performs. Job work is short-term contract revenue whereby the period of service is typically less than one
month in duration. The performance obligations linked to this revenue type are individual to each job due to
their nature, with revenue being recognised at a point in time on completion. Where consumables are
supplied separately from the service contract, revenue is recognised at the point the goods transfer.
The transaction price reported for all contracts is the price agreed in the contract and there are no material
elements of variable consideration, financing component or non-cash consideration. The Group applies the
practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining
performance obligations because the Group has a right to consideration from customers in an amount that
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance obligations completed to date.
Disaggregation of revenue into business segment, region and major type of revenue stream is shown below
under segmental reporting.
Performance obligations 
Revenue recognised over time - contract service revenue
These are mainly full-service contracts, inclusive of equipment, maintenance and consumables as required.
The inclusive service is treated as a single performance obligation.
Pest Control: the Group offers a range of services with by far the most common being general pest
maintenance contracts. Under this type of contract the Group promises to provide a pest control
service for the duration of the contract. In order to fulfil this promise, equipment is supplied (such as
bait boxes) and a technician maintains and monitors the equipment at a set number of visits per year,
plus any additional call-outs as required; so there is a stand-ready element to the service as well as an
ongoing service. The Group considers that this type of contract is a bundled service as the goods
and services are not distinct in the context of the contract; equipment is not supplied without the
service.
Hygiene & Wellbeing: the Group offers a similar type of service to Pest Control, providing washroom
equipment, consumables and a technician to service the washroom. This type of contract will include
a set number of visits. Dispensers are replenished by the technician. Management considers that the
supply of goods and services are not distinct in the context of the contract. Dispensers and other
equipment would not be supplied without providing the full service; the equipment is controlled by
the Group and ownership does not transfer to the customer. In Ambius (interior landscaping) the
major types of contract are for supply and maintenance of interior plants. Maintenance is only offered
for plants that were supplied by the Group and therefore the services are not distinct in the context of
the contract. The assets are positioned and situated by our technicians and the customer is not
permitted to relocate them. At the end of the contract any assets on the customer’s site are recovered.

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
France Workwear: the main type of contract is for supply and laundering of garments for commercial
organisations. Supply and laundry are not offered separately, therefore management considers the
services not to be distinct in the context of the contract. The service is treated as a bundle and a
single performance obligation. Any equipment remains under ownership and control of the Group.
Revenue recognised at a point in time - job work
These services are short term in nature and only an immaterial amount would straddle an accounting period
end. There is usually only one performance obligation with revenue recognised at the point of completion of
the work.
Pest Control: an example of this type of revenue in the Pest Control segment is bird-proofing which is
a one-off installation that, depending on the size of the site, may take between a few days and several
weeks to complete. There is a single performance obligation (to install bird-proofing) and the
customer is billed, and revenue recognised, at the end of the job. Our Property Care business
includes work such as woodworm treatment and damp-proofing. There is usually a single performance
obligation with revenue recognised at a point in time. The value of this work is immaterial.
Hygiene & Wellbeing: this type of revenue is also generated by our Specialist Hygiene team and in our
Ambius business. Our Specialist Hygiene team performs specialist cleaning services such as graffiti
removal, deep cleaning of kitchens and washrooms, trauma cleaning, flood or fire damage cleaning,
and during the pandemic has been providing specialist deep cleaning and disinfection services.
These are usually short-term jobs (under one week) and usually there is a single performance
obligation with revenue recognised on completion of the job. Our Ambius business includes work
such as Christmas installations (trees and decorations). There is usually a single performance
obligation with revenue recognised at a point in time. The value of this work is immaterial.
Revenue recognised at a point in time - sale of goods
Sale of products and consumables relates mainly to the pest distribution businesses which sell pest control
products to retailers and the pest control industry. In the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment there are some sales
of consumables to customers. In all cases, revenue is recognised at the point in time that ownership
transfers to the customer.
The Group does not consider that any judgements were made that would have a significant impact on the
amount or timing of revenue recognised. The contracts in the business where revenue is recognised over
time are repetitive and are based on short cycles that repeat many times per year. Therefore, if revenue had
been considered to be recognised at a point in time rather than over time, the in-year impact would be
immaterial.
The Group makes a charge against revenue for credit notes not yet issued at the balance sheet date. Due to
prolonged government lockdowns in the year ended 31 December 2020 where customer sites could not be
accessed, the charge for credit notes related to the UK (which makes up a significant part of the Group credit
note charge) increased significantly. This charge was estimated using data on incomplete service visits and
credit notes already issued in the year. The range of estimation uncertainty affecting the reported UK &
Ireland revenue of £287.5m was estimated to be between £(0.6)m and £4.7m. As the pandemic subsided
during 2021 and lockdowns in the UK were lifted, the estimate of the level of credit notes required became
more certain which affected the amount of revenue recognised in 2021.
Contract costs
Contract costs are mainly incremental costs of obtaining contracts (primarily sales commissions directly
related to contracts obtained), and to a lesser extent costs to fulfil contracts which are not within the scope
of other standards (mainly incremental costs of putting resources in place to fulfil contracts).
It is anticipated that these costs are recoverable over the life of the contract to which they relate.
Accordingly, the Group capitalises them as contract costs and amortises them over the expected life of the
F-17 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
contracts. Management takes a portfolio approach to recognising contract costs, and the expected length of
contracts across the Group and associated amortisation periods are between three and six years.
The contract costs recognised in the balance sheet at the period end amounted to £75.0m (2020: £67.8m). The
amount of amortisation recognised in the period was £30.4m (2020: £28.1m, 2019: £25.9m) and impairment
losses were £nil (2020: £nil, 2019: £nil).
Applying the practical expedient in paragraph 94 of IFRS 15, the Group recognises the incremental costs of
obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the assets that the Group
otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.
Contract assets
Contract assets relate to the Group’s right to consideration for performance obligations satisfied but where
the customer has yet to be invoiced. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights
become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customer. All opening
balances have been invoiced in the year.
Contract liabilities
Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers where the performance
obligations have yet to be satisfied. All opening balances have subsequently been satisfied in the year. In
most business segments where revenue is recognised over time customers are invoiced in advance or
simultaneously with performance obligations being satisfied.
Segment reporting
Segmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Reporting
segments reflect the internal management reporting structures. Each segment is headed by a Regional
Managing Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the Group’s Executive
Leadership Team responsible for the review of Group performance. The operating businesses within each
segment report to the Regional Managing Directors.
At 1 January 2022 Rentokil Initial made changes to the regional operating segments, designed to provide
clearer geographic links and to align growth strategies, as follows:
North America: Puerto Rico joined the Latin America region
Europe: Includes Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Poland), previously in UK & Rest
of World region
UK & Sub-Saharan Africa: No change to UK, Ireland & Baltics. Sub-Saharan Africa remained in this
region. Other Rest of World countries (MENAT and Caribbean) moved to other regions
Asia & MENAT: Enlarged region includes Asia and MENAT countries
Latin America: Includes Caribbean (formerly in UK & Rest of World) and Puerto Rico (formerly in
North America)
Pacific: No change
Rentokil Initial historically had operated three business segments: Pest Control, Hygiene and Protect &
Enhance. However, in response to the rising importance of hygiene and wellbeing services, at 1 January 2022
Rentokil Initial reorganised its business segments, primarily expanding the former Hygiene segment to
become Hygiene & Wellbeing and reclassifying the businesses in its former Protect & Enhance segment,
effective as at 1 January 2022. The Protect & Enhance segment had included five businesses: Ambius,
Property Care, Dental Services, Cleanroom Services and Workwear (France). The Ambius, Dental Services
and Cleanroom Services businesses have been added to the enlarged segment, now called Hygiene &
Wellbeing, the Property Care business has been added to the Pest Control segment and Workwear (France)
has been left as a stand-alone segment.

During 2021 internal management reporting structures changed and an immaterial amount of revenue
and profit previously reported under UK & Ireland is now reported under central and regional
overheads.
Revenue has been restated in 2020 and 2019 to reflect a correction in presentation in relation to certain
sales contracts where the Group acts as agent (reduction in revenue of £20.2m and £10.2m respectively).
In these contracts revenue is presented on a net basis.

A2. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the
Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the
Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust (see note at the bottom of the Consolidated Statement of Changes in
Equity) which are treated as cancelled, and including share options for which all conditions have been met.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to
include all potential dilutive ordinary shares. The Group’s potentially dilutive ordinary shares relate to the
contingent issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) to the extent that the
performance conditions have been met at the end of the period. These share options are issued for nil
consideration to colleagues if performance conditions are met.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable
to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
Adjusted profit measures are used to give management and other users of the accounts a clear
understanding of the underlying profitability of the business over time. Adjusted profit measures are
calculated by adding the following items back to the equivalent GAAP profit measure:
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software);
one-off items (operating and associates); and
net interest adjustments.
Intangible assets (excluding computer software) are recognised on acquisition of businesses which, by their
nature, can vary by size and amount each year. As a result, amortisation of intangibles is added back to
assist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow comparability
across regions and business segments.
One-off items are significant expenses or income that will have a distortive impact on the underlying
profitability of the Group. Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses (including
aborted acquisitions), gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses on disposal
of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy property-related provisions (environmental liabilities), and payments
or receipts as a result of legal disputes. An analysis of one-off operating items is set out in Note A1.
Other non-cash gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort understanding of the
performance of the business are net interest on pension schemes, interest fair value adjustments and the
excess IFRS 16 interest above the operating profit benefit reported in the year. These adjustments are made
to aid year-on-year comparability.
The Group has no instruments that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, which were
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:

A3. Trade and other receivables
The Group’s trade receivables are recognised at the transaction price less provision for impairment. They are
generally due for settlement within 30 days and are therefore all classified as current. The amount of the
provision for impairment is recognised in the income statement and movements on provisions for impaired
trade receivables are recognised within operating expenses in the income statement. Amounts are generally
charged to the provision for impairment of trade receivables when there is no expectation of recovering
additional cash.
Expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are performed quarterly and are used to calculate the provision. ECL
calculations are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses and are performed at country level. The
Group applies the simplified method of applying lifetime ECLs to trade receivables using an allowance matrix
to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from its customers, which comprise customer portfolios across
several countries. Credit risk factors that are considered as part of ECL calculations may include, but are not
limited to: payment history, customer size, customer type (national/residential/commercial/​government), age
of debt, industry strength, economy, environmental factors such as climate change and product or service
provided.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the Group’s customer
base being large and diverse. The amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented

by the carrying amount on the balance sheet. The Group policy is that credit facilities for new customers are
approved by designated managers at regional level. Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and
reports from credit rating agencies where they are available. Where this is not feasible the Group may request
payment in advance of work being carried out, or settlement by credit card on completion of the work. There
are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the risk of impairment of trade receivables increased significantly in the year
ended 31 December 2020. ECL calculations reflected management’s estimate of the increased risk that some
customers will be unable to settle their debts. As the pandemic subsided the situation became clearer and
these estimates were reassessed in the year ended 31 December 2021.

Contract assets represents revenue that has been recognised for performance obligations satisfied but
where the customer has yet to be invoiced. All opening balances have subsequently been invoiced in
the year. In most business segments our customers are invoiced in advance or simultaneously with
performance obligations being satisfied. No provision for impairment has been recognised against
contract assets (2020: £nil).
Trade and other receivables and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020 due
to a correction of the recognition of an overseas factoring arrangement. Both have been increased by
£21.0m.

Due to the increased risk of business failures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in trade
receivable balances over three months old as at 31 December 2020, the provision for impairment against
these receivables was adjusted to reflect management’s view of the increased risk of impairment.

Fair value is considered to be equal to carrying value for all trade and other receivables.
A4. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted
average cost method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises design costs, raw
materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating
capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less applicable
variable selling expenses.

Contract liabilities represents customer invoices where performance obligations have not yet been
satisfied. All opening balances have subsequently been satisfied in the year. In most business
segments our customers are invoiced in advance or simultaneously with performance obligations being
satisfied.
Put options are held following the acquisition of PCI in 2017 where the seller may require the Group to
purchase the remaining shares of the business in stages over a fixed term between 2023 and 2027. The put
options are accounted for as an anticipated acquisition of the remaining shares and no non-controlling
interest is recognised. The Group recognised a put option liability for the anticipated acquisition of these
shares in contingent consideration, and any movements in the carrying value are recognised through equity.
The assumptions that are made in estimating the value of this put option liability are option price and
discount rate. A 5% reduction in the estimated option price would result in a £2.1m decrease in the liability,
and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in a £1.3m increase in the liability. All gains and losses
relating to the put options are recognised through equity.
Given the volume of acquisitions and the variety of inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration
(depending on each transaction) there is not considered to be any change in input that would have a material
impact on the contingent consideration liability.
Other than the put options, there are no liabilities in the table above that bear interest and therefore the cash
flows are equal to the carrying value of the liabilities. Cash is due to flow between one and five years for all
non-current liabilities and not beyond. Fair value is equal to carrying value for all trade and other payables.
There is no material difference between the fair value and carrying value for all trade and other payables.

A6. Provisions for liabilities and charges
The Group has environmental, self-insurance and other provisions. Provisions are recognised when the
Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation, and the amount is capable of being reliably estimated. If such an obligation
is not capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability (Note D3).
Future cash flows relating to these obligations are discounted when the effect is material. In the years
ending 31 December 2021 and 2020 the US was the only country where the effect of discounting was material.
The discount rates used are based on government bond rates in the country of the cash flows, and were
0.9% (2020: 0.9%) for the US.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for environmental restoration. These
provisions tend to be long term in nature and the use of an appropriate market discount rate and forecast
future utilisation based upon management’s best estimate determines the level of provision required at the
balance sheet date. The phasing and actual cash spend may be different from the forecast on which the
provision is based.

Self-insurance
The Group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks,
mainly employee-related risks. Self-insured deductibles within these insurance policies have changed over
time due to external market conditions and scale of operations. These provisions represent obligations for
open claims and are estimated based on actuarial/management’s assessment at the balance sheet date. The
Group expects to continue self-insuring the same level of risks and estimates that 50% to 75% of claims
should settle within the next five years.
Other
Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising and costs relating to
disposed businesses and restructuring costs. Other provisions also include costs relating to properties the
Group no longer occupies such as security, utilities and insurance. Existing provisions are expected to be
substantially utilised within the next five years.

A9. Employee benefit expense
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on calculations of
achievements of financial performance targets and based on the best estimate of the obligation to colleagues
related to personal performance criteria being achieved. A liability is recognised where a contractual
obligation exists or where past practice indicates that there is a constructive obligation to make such
payments in the future.
Holiday pay
Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the
benefits are earned. An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned
but not yet taken.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or
whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises
termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current
colleagues according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination
benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12
months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is
material.

A10. Retirement benefit obligations
Apart from contributions to legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of
pension schemes around the world covering many of its colleagues.
The principal pension scheme in the Group is the UK Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme (RIPS) which has
a defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new
entrants and future accrual of benefits. On 4 December 2018, the Group signed an agreement with Pension
Insurance Corporation plc (PIC) to take over the payment of the liabilities in the scheme via a buy-in, which
converted to a full buy-out on 24 February 2022.
A number of much smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere which are
also funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.
Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial
assumptions. Judgement is required in determining these actuarial assumptions.
Defined benefit pension plans
A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that estimates the amount of future pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as years of service,
compensation and age.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair
value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The
Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset for the period by applying the discount
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined
F-32 
(1)
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
benefit asset. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that
have a credit rating of at least AA, are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and
that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group will
recognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an unconditional right to a refund or where the Group
has a right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of any minimum
funding requirements.
Current and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or
credits against operating profit in the income statement. Interest income on the net defined benefit asset is
recognised in finance income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, return
on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income.
Defined contribution pension plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity.
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory,
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have
been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future
payments is available.
RIPS
The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from the Group. The Trustee of the RIPS is Rentokil Initial
Pension Trustee Limited. The board comprises five company-nominated directors and three member-
nominated directors. The Trustee is required by law to act in the best interests of the members and
beneficiaries of the RIPS and is responsible for setting certain policies (e.g., investment, contribution and
indexation policies) of the scheme.
On 4 December 2018 the Trustee entered into a binding agreement with PIC to insure the liabilities of the
RIPS, known as a buy-in. In December 2021 the final true-up premium was paid to PIC and on 24 February
2022 the insurance policy with PIC was transferred to the individual members of the scheme. Accordingly, in
2022 both the Scheme’s assets and liabilities have been reduced by the policy value (£1,238.6m).
There remains some uncertainty regarding the final surplus that will be available to the Group until
Guaranteed Minimum Pension adjustments for members who transferred out of the scheme have been settled
and final scheme expenses have been paid. However, in December 2020 the Trustee made a partial refund of
surplus to the Group of £13.0m. The remaining surplus is recognised as a retirement benefit asset at
management’s estimate of the value that will be returned to the Group when the wind-up of the Scheme
completes.
The defined benefit schemes of the RIPS are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based
upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements (including schemes which are insured
under a buy-in contract). The assumptions used for the RIPS are shown below:

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current colleagues, former colleagues and current
pensioners. Approximately 40% (2020: 35%) of the liabilities are attributable to current and former colleagues
and 60% (2020: 65%) to current pensioners. There have been no significant changes to the membership of
the scheme over the year. The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit
payments are made. For the RIPS as a whole, the duration is around 17 years.
The assets in the scheme consist of cash held in liquidity funds, and the fair value of the insurance policy.
The fair value of the insurance policy asset is deemed to be equal to the present value of the related
obligations that it covers at the balance sheet date.
Risks
As noted above, the Trustee purchased an insurance policy that covers all retirement benefit obligations
within the Scheme, thereby removing exposure to the significant risks within the Scheme (including changes
in bond yields, inflation and longevity). The Scheme’s insurer (PIC) is now responsible for ensuring that
there are sufficient assets to meet all future pension obligations, and is subject to EU solvency regulations.
There is no volatility associated with the insurance policy asset as under IAS 19 its value is deemed to
match the Scheme liabilities. Asset volatility is limited only to the assets remaining in the Scheme following
this transaction which are expected to be returned to the Company on wind-up of the Scheme. The surplus
recognised of £18.2m is management’s estimate of the asset that will return to the Company on wind-up
(subject to tax at 35%).
Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of Scheme members, and allow
for expected future improvements in mortality rates. The mortality tables used are:
98% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male pensioners;
107% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for female pensioners;
108% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male and female non-pensioners; and
96% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male and female dependent pensioners.
Future improvements are made in line with CMI_2018 Core Projections with a long-term rate of future
improvement of 1.25% p.a.
Sensitivity of significant assumptions
The purchase of an insurance policy to cover all future benefits means that the sensitivity of the balance
sheet and income statement to key assumptions is removed.

The actuarial movement on the UK RIPS comprises remeasurement gain arising from changes in
demographic assumptions of £2.7m (2020: gain of £16.1m), remeasurement gain arising from changes in
financial assumptions of £75.3m (2020: loss of £117.1m) and a remeasurement loss arising from
experience of £0.5m (2020: gain of £25.0m).
Benefit plans in an obligation position include plans situated in Ireland, the UK, Martinique, Trinidad
and Tobago, Norway, South Africa, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, South Korea, Philippines, India,
Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia (2021 only) and the US (2020 only).
Benefit plans in an asset position include plans situated in the UK, Barbados (2021 only) and Australia.
Included in the table above is a net defined benefit surplus in relation to the UK RIPS of £18.2m (2020:
£18.2m) recognised as defined benefit obligation of £1,247.6m (2020: £1,369.3m) and plan assets of £1,265.8m
(2020: £1,387.5m). Of the £1,313.5m (2020: £1,481.1m) of obligations, £17.0m (2020: £18.3m) is unfunded.
Total contributions payable to defined benefit pension schemes in 2022 are expected to be less than £1m.

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement:
unquoted debt instruments (Level 2);
interest and inflation rate hedging instruments (Level 2); and
pooled investment funds (Level 3).
Other significant assets are valued based on observable market inputs. Insurance policies are valued at the
present value of the related obligations. Other assets primarily consist of cash.
The cumulative actuarial gain recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was
£32.0m (2020: £31.2m).
A remeasurement gain of £0.9m (2020: £13.1m loss) was recognised during the year.
A11. Share-based payments
Share-based compensation
The Group operates one equity-settled share-based long-term incentive plan (LTIP). The economic cost of
awarding shares and share options to colleagues is recognised as an expense in the income statement,
equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing
models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The charge is recognised in the income
statement over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of
the number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision to the
original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately
to the extent it relates to past service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Performance Share Plan
The Company introduced a share-based performance plan in 2006 for senior managers worldwide. The main
features of the scheme are as follows:
For awards made in 2018, one-third of the award is based on earnings per share (EPS) growth targets
and two-thirds of the award is based on total shareholder return (TSR) over the three-year
performance period as explained above.
For awards made in 2019, 50% of the award is based on TSR and 25% is based on EPS growth targets
as explained above. The remaining 25% is based on performance against certain strategic and
financial measures over the vesting period.
For awards made in 2020, 60% of the award is based on TSR and 40% is based on performance against
certain strategic and financial measures over the vesting period.
For awards made in 2021, 50% of the award is based on TSR and 50% is based on performance against
certain strategic and financial measures over the vesting period.
F-36 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The value of dividends paid during the vesting period is paid on the number of shares that ultimately
vest in the form of additional shares.
For awards that are nil-cost options, this is the value of dividends between grant and exercise.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was £9.8m (2020:
£5.5m).

Of the 22.1m options outstanding at 31 December 2021, 8.85m are only subject to administrative exercise for
no proceeds and have been considered as outstanding shares in basic earnings per share (7.7m at 31
December 2020).
The fair value of the awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement
over the vesting period based on values derived from a Monte Carlo model prepared by external
remuneration consultants. This is a closed-form solution which takes account of the correlation between
share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met. For the shares
awarded in March 2021, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 495.7p (2020: 536.8p), an
expected share price volatility of 23.2% (2020: 22.0%), a median share price correlation between the
companies in the comparator group of 91.0% (2020: 83.0%), and an expected life commensurate with the
three-year

performance/vesting period. The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily
share prices. As the awards are nil-cost (i.e., there is no exercise price), the assumed risk-free rate of return
has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards. Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting
portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting
period.
The fair value of awards granted during 2021 was £16.0m (2020: £14.1m) and the weighted average fair value
per award granted during the year was 371.7p. The weighted average share price for options exercised in the
year was 505.6p and the weighted average contract term remaining on shares unexercised at the year end was
450 days.
A12. Income tax expense
The income tax expense for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax expense
represents the amount payable on this year’s taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years.
Taxable profits differ from accounting profits as some items of income or expenditure are not taxable or
deductible or may be taxable or deductible in a different accounting period. The current income tax charge is
calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the
countries where the Group’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to
differences between accounting and tax bases. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to
apply when the timing difference reverses based on tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted at
the balance sheet date. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.

The Group’s Effective Tax Rate (ETR) for 2021 on reported profit before income tax is 19.0% (2020: 18.9%,
2019: 16.2%). The Group’s ETR before amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-
off items and the net interest adjustments for 2021 was 19.4% (2020: 19.7%, 2019: 21.6%). This compares with
a blended rate of tax for the countries in which the Group operates of 24% (2020: 24%, 2019: 23%). The
Group’s low tax rate is primarily attributable to net prior-year tax credits of £16.2m. Of this, £7.2m is due to a
reduction in the Group’s uncertain tax provisions arising as a result of issues being settled for less than the
provision held or becoming statute barred during the year ended 31 December 2021. The Group’s ETR is low
for the year ended 31 December 2020 compared with the prior year mainly due to the impact of deferred tax
rate changes in the UK and France.
The Group’s tax charge and ETR will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future
tax rates and other tax legislation, foreign exchange rates, the utilisation of brought-forward tax losses on
which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the resolution of open issues with various tax authorities,
acquisitions and disposals.
A tax credit of £2.2m has been recognised in other comprehensive income which relates to the tax effect of
mark to market movements on cross-currency and interest rate swaps recorded within other comprehensive
income.
A13. Current tax liabilities
Tax liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless there is a right to defer the payment of the liability for
at least one year after the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2021 and 2020 all the Group’s tax liabilities
have been classified as current as there is no legally enforceable right to defer payment for more than 12
months.

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the asset
and liability.
Where required by accounting standards, management establishes provisions for uncertain tax positions on
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The Group’s current tax liabilities reflect
management’s best estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will be settled.
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. There are various uncertainties relating to
the determination of its tax liabilities where the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a resolution has
been reached with the relevant tax authority, or the issue becomes time barred. Issues can take many years to
resolve and therefore assumptions on the likely outcome have to be made by management. Each country and
tax risk is considered separately when deciding whether it is appropriate to set up an uncertain tax provision.
If risks are considered to be linked, the Group will consider the tax treatment in aggregate where appropriate.
This assessment of uncertain tax positions is based on management’s interpretation of relevant tax rules and
decided cases, external advice obtained, the statute of limitations and the status of the negotiations and past
experience with tax authorities. In evaluating whether a provision is needed it is assumed that tax authorities
have full knowledge of the facts and circumstances applicable to each issue.
Tax provisions can be built up over a number of years but in the year of resolution there could be
adjustments to these provisions which could have a material positive or negative impact on the tax charge
for a particular year. The settlement of a significant issue could also have a material impact on the amount of
cash tax payable in any one year. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income
taxes particularly in relation to the pricing of intra-group goods and services as well as debt financing.
The majority of the tax provisions relate to transfer pricing exposures where the Group faces a number of
risks in jurisdictions around the world, and is subject to audits by tax authorities in the territories in which it
operates. These tax audits have an uncertain outcome and can take several years to resolve, which in some
cases may be dependent on litigation. The actual outcome could vary from management’s estimates, but
these are updated at each reporting period in the light of the latest available information.
Total uncertain tax provisions (including interest thereon) amounted to £57.2m as at 31 December 2021 (2020:
£64.6m). Included within this amount is £11.5m (2020: £11.5m) in respect of interest arising on tax provisions
which is included within other payables. These tax provisions relate to multiple issues across the countries
in which the Group operates. The net decrease in the provisions for the year is mainly attributable to issues
which have been settled in the year or have become statute barred.
Apart from transfer pricing exposures the largest single provision relates to a financing structure where the
amount provided is £11.0m (2020: £10.9m) including interest. This is a legacy issue going back to the years
2002 to 2004. The Group is fully provided for the potential tax and interest payable so there is not expected to
be an adverse impact on the income statement. It is unclear when this issue will be resolved and therefore
the timing of any payment is uncertain.
The cash tax paid for the year was £68.9m (2020: £64.4m, 2019: £43.2m), the increase being in line with the
increased profits. The cash tax paid is expected to increase in future periods as open issues are resolved
although it is not possible to estimate the exact timing of tax cash flows.
A14. Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following temporary
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or
liabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither
the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted (or substantively enacted) at the balance sheet date, and
F-40

are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the timing differences relate to income
taxes levied by the same tax authority on an entity or different entities which are part of a tax consolidation
and there would be the intention to settle on a net basis.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax assets
recognised at each balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect changes in management’s assessment of future
taxable profits. In recognising the deferred tax asset in respect of losses, management has estimated the
quantum of future taxable profits applying a risk weighting to future profits to reflect the uncertainties.

Included within other deferred tax assets/liabilities are bad debt provisions, other provisions and IFRS

The UK corporate tax rate will increase from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. This has resulted in an
increase in the UK deferred tax asset recognized at 31 December 2021 of £3.1m.
A deferred tax asset of £13.9m (2020: £17.5m) has been recognised in respect of losses, of which £12.4m
(2020: £16.0m) relates to UK losses carried forward at 31 December 2021. This amount has been calculated by
estimating the future UK taxable profits, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax
rates (substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date) applicable for each year. Remaining UK tax losses
of £40.6m (2020: £47.5m) have not been recognised as at 31 December 2021 as it is not considered probable
that future taxable profits will be available against which the tax losses can be offset. The estimates of future
profits are based on management’s financial forecasts which are used to support other aspects of the
financial statements such as impairment testing. At the balance sheet date the Group had tax losses of
£81.6m (2020: £105.0m) on which no deferred tax asset is recognised because it is not considered probable
that future taxable profits will be available in certain jurisdictions to be able to benefit from those tax losses.
Of the losses, £8.3m (2020: £14.6m) will expire at various dates between 2022 and 2032.
In addition, the Group has UK capital losses carried forward of £276.3m (2020: £276.3m) on which no deferred
tax asset is recognised. These losses have no expiry date but management considers the future utilisation of
these losses to be unlikely.
Dividends received from subsidiaries are largely exempt from UK taxation but may be subject to dividend
withholding or other taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate. A
deferred tax liability of £4.7m (2020: £4.3m) has been recognised in respect of this liability as it is anticipated
that these profits will be distributed to the UK in the foreseeable future. At the balance sheet date there is no
material unprovided deferred tax liability were overseas earnings to be distributed to the UK.
B. Investing
B1. Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method (acquisition accounting) in
accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the
fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments
issued by the acquirer. The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by
recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition
criteria at their fair values. The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control
of the acquiree.
An intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition under IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The intangible
assets arising on acquisition are goodwill, customer lists and brands. Goodwill represents the synergies,
workforce and other benefits expected as a result of combining the respective businesses. Customer lists and
brands are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition using an income-based approach,

which involves the use of assumptions including customer termination rates, profit margins, contributory
asset charges and discount rates. The use of these assumptions requires estimation in the valuation
approach; however, it is not considered that these estimates carry a significant risk of material adjustment.
At the date of acquisition, deferred and contingent consideration represents its fair value, with subsequent
changes after the measurement period being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.
Costs directly attributable to business combinations are charged to the income statement as incurred and
presented as one-off items.
During the year ended 31 December 2021 the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets
of 52 companies and businesses. It also acquired the remaining shares from a non-controlling interest which
is recognised as an equity transaction rather than a business combination. The total consideration in respect
of these acquisitions was £313.7m and the cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions net of
cash acquired, was £463.1m.
During the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets
of 23 companies and businesses. The total consideration in respect of these acquisitions was £367.3m and
the cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was £194.7m.
During the year ended 31 December 2019 the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets
of 41 companies and businesses. The total consideration in respect of these acquisitions was £328.6m and
the cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was £315.7m.
Disclosures required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations are provided separately for those individual
acquisitions that are considered to be material, and in aggregate for individually immaterial acquisitions. An
acquisition would generally be considered individually material if the impact on the Group’s adjusted
revenue and profit measures (on an annualised basis) is greater than 5%, or the impact on goodwill is greater
than 10% of the closing balance for the period. There were no individually material acquisitions in the years
ended 31 December 2021, 2020 or 2019.

Of the above goodwill amounts £146.4m (2020: £303.5m, 2019: £258.4m) is expected to qualify for tax relief.
Deferred consideration of £12.6m (2020: £192.3m, 2019: £23.4m) and contingent consideration of £28.0m
(2020: £18.1m, 2019: £14.9m) are payable in respect of the above acquisitions. Contingent consideration is
payable based on a variety of conditions including revenue and profit targets being met. Amounts for both
deferred and contingent consideration are payable over the next five years. The Group has recognised
contingent and deferred consideration based on fair value at the acquisition date. A range of outcomes for
contingent consideration payments cannot be estimated due to the variety of performance conditions and
the volume of businesses the Group acquires. During the year ended 31 December 2021 there were releases
of contingent consideration liabilities not paid of £0.6m (2020: £1.6m, 2019: £1.1m).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Includes acquisitions in the year to 31 December 2021 of £301.3m (2020: £374.3m) as well as adjustments
to prior-year acquisitions within the measurement period.
The main categories of intangible assets are as follows:
Intangible assets - finite useful lives
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a
straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. These assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired
through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be
generated from that asset at the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Group. The residual
values of intangible assets are assumed to be £nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:
Customer lists:
3 to 15 years
Other intangibles:
2 to 15 years
Product development:
2 to 5 years
Computer software:
3 to 5 years
The following are the main categories of intangible assets with finite useful lives:
(a) Customer lists
Customer lists are acquired as part of business combinations. No value is attributed to internally generated
customer lists.
(b) Other intangibles
Other intangibles consists of brands and intellectual property. Brands are acquired as part of business
combinations. No value is attributed to internally generated brands as expenditure incurred to develop,
maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred. Intellectual property
costs are incurred in acquiring and maintaining patents and licences. These are recognised only if the cost
can be measured reliably, and they are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, in excess of
their cost.
(c) Product development
Costs incurred in the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets
only if the cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the project will be a success considering its
commercial and technological feasibility. Capitalised product development expenditure is measured at cost
less accumulated amortisation.
Other development expenditure and all research expenditure are recognised as an expense as incurred. This
expense was £2.3m in the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020: £1.6m, 2019: £2.2m).
Development costs recognised as an expense are never reclassified as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is made available.
(d) Computer software
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products that are
controlled by the Group (including employee costs and external software development costs) are recognised
F-46 
(1)

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
as intangible assets if they are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, in excess of their
cost. Purchased computer software is initially recognised based on the costs incurred to acquire and bring it
into use.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense in the period in which
they are incurred.
Intangible assets - indefinite useful lives
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an intangible
asset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included in investments in associates.
A breakdown of goodwill by region is shown below. The amounts have been reclassified to reflect the
changes to geographical segments described in note A1.

Includes £1,100.2m as at 31 December 2021 (2020: £996.0m) relating to the US Pest Control CGU.
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to
country of operation and reportable business unit. The way in which CGUs are identified has not changed
from prior periods. Newly acquired entities might be a single CGU until such time that they can be integrated.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity
sold.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash
flow projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are
based on financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group’s normal
planning process. Cash flows for years two to five use management’s expectation of sales growth, operating
costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and
F-47

RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
profitability for each CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-
term growth rates (LTGR).
Cash flow projections included in the impairment review models include management’s view of the impact of
climate change, including costs related to the effects of climate change, as well as the future costs of the
Group’s commitment to reach net zero by 2040 and costs of compliance with current legal requirements. The
potential increased costs, less any benefits that may occur, to meet these commitments are not expected to
be material and therefore have resulted in no impairments during 2021 or 2020.
For the Rentokil PCI CGU in India the assumptions made in estimating the value of the future cash flows are
an LTGR of 4.0% (2020: 5.0%), a pre-tax discount rate of 12.6% (2020: 13.9%) and a terminal operating margin
of 15.1%. The headroom for the Rentokil PCI CGU was £5.4m at 30 September 2021 and £3.4m at 31 December
2020.
The table below shows the potential impairment created by a change in assumptions.

For the Brazil CGU the assumptions made in estimating the value of the future cash flows in the year ended
31 December 2020 were an LTGR of 4.0%, a pre-tax discount rate of 18.5% and a terminal operating margin of
13.0%. The impairment assessment revealed an impairment of £2.5m.

For all other goodwill balances it can be demonstrated that there is sufficient headroom in the recoverable
amount of the CGU goodwill balances based on the assumptions made, and there is not considered to be any
reasonably likely scenario under which material impairment could be expected to occur based on the testing
performed.

Key assumptions used by the US Pest Control CGU were a long-term growth rate of 2.2% (2020: 2.3%)
and a pre-tax discount rate of 7.7% (2020: 11.6%). For US Pest Control CGU the recoverable amount
exceeds the carrying amount by £2,120.8m (2020: £925.2m).
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the LTGR predicted for the relevant sector and
country in which a business operates. They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that
industry or country. The pre-tax discount rates are internally calculated weighted average cost of capital for
each segment and country.
B3. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less depreciation with the exception of freehold land

Includes current-year acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2021 of £11.4m (2020: £5.7m) as well
as adjustments to prior-year acquisitions within the measurement period.
Certain leased assets become owned assets at the end of their lease period and are therefore reclassified
from ROU assets (Note B4).
Depreciation of assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between their
cost and their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold buildings:
50 to 100 years
Leasehold improvements:
Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life
Vehicles:
4 to 10 years
Plant and equipment (including service
contract equipment):
3 to 10 years
Office equipment, furniture and fittings:
3 to 10 years
Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually and amended as necessary. Fixed assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the fixed asset may exceed its recoverable amount. There were £nil of impairments in the year (2020: £0.4m).
When assets are sold, the gain or loss between sale proceeds and net book value is recognised in the
income statement.
The category of service contract equipment represents the pool of assets used by the Group in delivering
contracted services to customers. Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and offices.

B4. Leases
The Group leases land and buildings, vehicles and other equipment. The lease durations vary from lease to
lease according to the asset leased and local practices. Some of the Group’s leases have extension and
termination options attached to them. Lease extension options and lease termination options are only
included in the calculation of the lease liability if there is reasonable certainty that they will be exercised.
Judgement is required to determine the level of certainty.
The value of leases to which the Group is committed but have not yet commenced is not material.
The Group exercised one sale and leaseback transaction in the year ended 31 December 2020 which resulted
in a net cash inflow of £4.4m and a gain in the year of £2.0m. The new lease term was 10 years with a total
lease liability at the start of the lease of £2.3m.

C. Financing
C1. Financial risk management
The Group’s central treasury function manages cash, borrows on behalf of the Group and provides finance
to Group companies in their local currencies. Treasury activity is governed by a Treasury Committee which is
chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are set out below.
(a) Liquidity risk
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its business needs, and appropriate
reserves to cover operational underperformance or dislocation in the financial markets. It is the Group’s
policy to have headroom of unrestricted cash and available committed facilities of at least £600m (2020:
£150m - £600m), and the Treasury Committee manages financing requirements and associated headroom at
least 12 months forward.
In July 2021 the Group repaid the remaining €175.7m outstanding under the €350m bond due in October 2021
using cash from the November 2020 €600m bond issuance under its three months at par call option. Available
commitments of £550m under the revolving credit facility (RCF) together with unrestricted cash of £235.3m
gave the Group combined headroom of £785.3m at 31 December 2021.
In March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group drew down the full £550m available under
its RCF. After establishing a £1bn Commercial Paper Programme, the Group drew down £600m on the Bank of
England’s Covid Commercial Financing Facility (CCFF) in April 2020. Both the RCF and the CCFF were repaid
in full in June and July respectively. The Group repaid its two fixed interest perpetual debentures for £1.3m
and £0.3m in May 2020. These were originally issued in 1898 and 1904 respectively. The $50m term loan was
repaid on maturity on 19 June 2020. In August 2020 the second of the two one-year extension options on the
RCF was exercised and granted resulting in a new maturity date of 22 August 2025. In October 2020 the
Group issued an eight-year €600m bond with a coupon of 0.50% under its Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN)
Programme. Part of the bond proceeds were used to repay c.50% of the €350m bond that matured in October
2021 following a successful tender offer in November 2020. Available commitments of £550m under the RCF
together with unrestricted cash of £716.3m gave the Group combined headroom of £1,266.3m at 31 December
2020.
The Group has a £550m RCF with 17 relationship banks (see Note C7 for details). In September 2021, the
Group negotiated the permanent removal of financial covenants from the RCF with all bank approval. In
addition to this the Group also amended the RCF to comply with the move from LIBOR to risk free rates. The
Group has no other facility that references LIBOR. Previously the facilities contained covenants that
required EBITDA:net interest to be at least 4.0:1.0 and that net debt:adjusted EBITDA should be no greater
than 3.5:1.0. Compliance with financial and other covenants were reviewed regularly and financial covenants
were reported to the lenders semi-annually in line with the requirements under the facility. The Group is
compliant with the terms and conditions of its debt facilities.
The Group targets an S&P Global (S&P) investment grade credit rating for debt issuance of BBB over the
medium term. In line with S&P liquidity ratio requirements, debt maturities are financed at least 12 months in
advance using available cash or committed facilities, or by issuance of new debt. Management maintains an
active dialogue with S&P, as well as the Group’s relationship banks, to ensure that any changes to the
Group’s financing and acquisition strategies are understood. S&P affirmed the Group’s rating as BBB if the
acquisition of Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. goes ahead as announced.
All of the Group’s bonds issued under its EMTN Programme contain a coupon step-up which increases the
coupon payable by 1.25% in the event that the Group is downgraded to BB+ or below (sub-investment
grade). The Group’s bonds may be called by their investors at par in the event of a change of control of the
Group. They may also be called within 120 days if the Group’s debt is downgraded below investment
F-54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
grade, or if the rating is withdrawn and the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or to the Group
or the Trustee, that the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to a change of control.
(b) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales are typically low-value, high-volume,
spreading the risk across a large number of customers and geographies. Policies are in place to ensure that
credit sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history. The Group operates in some
territories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks and in those territories the Group puts in
place appropriate measures to manage its credit risk exposure.
In order to protect the liquid assets and funding relationships of the Group, management aims to maintain
banking relationships with counterparties that carry a long-term credit rating of at least A-, or equivalent
rating with one of the major credit rating agencies. In countries where no banks are rated A- or above,
balances are monitored monthly and kept to a minimum. In addition, funds held with all counterparties are
subject to limits. All exposures are monitored and reported to the Treasury Committee each month. The
Group also monitors the creditworthiness of its lenders to ensure that commitments under its facilities are
available as needed.
At 31 December 2021 the Group had a total of £10.7m of cash held on bank accounts with banks rated below
A- by S&P (2020: £10.0m). The highest concentration with any single bank rated below A- was £1.7m (2020:
£1.8m).
(c) Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies. Sales and
purchases are typically denominated in the currency of the country in which they are transacted, and the
Group’s cross-border procurement is considered insignificant. Sterling procurement and central costs mean
that foreign currencies constitute more than 100% of Group adjusted operating profit at approximately 104%
(2020: 117%).
The Group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is in relation to the translation of assets and
liabilities, and the Group aims to hold debt in currencies in proportion to its forecast foreign currency profits
and investments. Foreign exchange derivatives are used to manage foreign currency exposures in excess of
£0.5m (£5.0m for USD) that are not covered by debt or assets in the same (or another highly correlated)
currency, as long as it makes sense from an economic perspective to do so. The Treasury Committee
monitors foreign exchange exposures on a monthly basis. Dealing in foreign exchange products is controlled
by dealing mandates approved by the Treasury Committee and all foreign exchange transactions are covered
by ISDA documentation.
The most significant foreign currency groups are US dollars and euros, which make up 41.5% (2020: 46.7%)
and 34.8% (2020: 41.0%) of Group adjusted operating profit respectively.
At 31 December 2021 the Group’s net debt was approximately 57% US dollar (2020: 48%), reflecting that it is
the Group’s principal cash flow exposure; and 45% euro (2020: 52%), with 2% net cash offset in other
currencies. The translation of the interest element of euro and US dollar debt provides a partial income
statement offset to the translation of earnings.
The Group calculates the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income of a 10%
movement in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s principal foreign currency exposure is the US dollar. For
US dollars, a 10% movement in £/$ would result in a £19.4m increase/decrease (2020: £17.8m) in adjusted
operating profit, offset by a £1.6m decrease/increase (2020: £1.2m) in interest payable. A 10% movement in £/​
€ would result in a £15.6m increase/decrease (2020: £15.6m) in adjusted operating profit, offset by a £1.0m
decrease/increase (2020: £1.5m) in interest payable.
F-55 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in preference to selling
currency in the market.
Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge while
allowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of its cash flows. Interest rate risk is
managed by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which are approved in advance by the
Treasury Committee. The Group policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate
exposures (excluding pensions) for a minimum period of 12 months forward. The Treasury Committee reviews
this exposure monthly. During the year ended 31 December 2021 the Group signed IBOR Fallback Protocols
with the two banks that have provided interest rate hedges that reference LIBOR. The Group has no other
LIBOR-based exposures.
A hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro interest rates would reduce the market value of the Group’s bond
liabilities by £61.9m at 31 December 2021 (2020: £79.8m). The income statement impact is £nil as changes in
interest rates do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.
The Group had outstanding bond debt issues at 31 December 2021 with a fair market value of £1,272.1m
(2020: £1,537.3m). This exceeds the book value of £1,253.7m (2020: £1,487.8m) as a result of reductions in
interest rates in Europe. There are no circumstances where the Group would be obliged to pay the fair market
value. The Group could however decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is
indicative of the price that would be required to do so.
In 2019, to manage its US dollar interest cost, the Group entered into a low volatility Synthetic Borrowing
Unit (SBU) instrument for $335m that yielded 1.90%. The SBU instrument effectively hedged the £/$
movement but at a lower cost of debt. Due to a reduction in US base rate a decision was made to trade out of
the SBU in August 2020. The interest benefit generated by the SBU for 2020 was £3.1m.
(d) Capital risk
The Group is committed to maintaining a debt/equity structure that allows continued access to a broad range
of financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they present themselves,
without onerous financing terms and conditions. The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so
as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the Group’s strategy. The Group uses
S&P’s ratings methodology for a BBB issuer to manage its capital risk. In the event that a ratings downgrade
is likely net debt can be managed by reducing or suspending dividends, M&A spend and capital
expenditure. The Group would also consider raising additional equity to protect its BBB rating.
(e) Treasury risk
The Group’s treasury activities are governed by a treasury policy, which is reviewed and approved by the
Board on an annual basis. The treasury policy covers all activities associated with managing the above risks.
The policy requires that financial instruments are only utilised to manage known financial exposures and
speculative derivative contracts are not entered into. The treasury policy requires that the Group Treasury
function must approve opening and closing of all bank accounts, and that funds transfers and other
payments are only made in accordance with bank mandates.
To ensure an appropriate control environment exists in the treasury function, duties are segregated between
front and back office teams. In addition a number of controls are in place to protect against potential cyber
security and other risks.
LIBOR reform
In September 2021 the Group updated its RCF to incorporate the switch from LIBOR to risk free rates. The
Group has also signed ISDA fallback agreements with its interest rate swap counterparties, which means that
the Group has no exposure to GBP or USD LIBOR going forward.

Both cash and cash equivalents and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020
by reducing cash in hand and overdrafts by £276.1m to reflect a correction in presentation by netting
position of the main and shadow bank accounts pool arrangement which were previously grossed up
(Note C3).
Bank and other short-term borrowings consists of £nil bond debt (2020: £156.5m), £426.5m overdraft
(2020: £1,398.7m), £29.7m overseas loans (2020: £31.9m) and £3.1m bond accruals (2020: £4.5m).
Trade and other receivables and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020 due
to a correction of the recognition of an overseas factoring arrangement. Both have been increased by
£21.0m.
Bank and other long-term borrowings consists of £1,253.7m bond debt (2020: £1,331.3m) and £2.4m
overseas loans (2020: £6.3m).

Both cash and cash equivalents and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020
by reducing cash in hand and overdrafts by £276.1m to reflect a correction in presentation by netting
position of the main and shadow bank accounts pool arrangement which were previously grossed up
(Note C3).
Trade and other receivables and bank and other short-term borrowings have been restated in 2020 due
to a correction of the recognition of an overseas factoring arrangement. Both have been increased by
£21.0m.
The foreign exchange gain on debt and derivatives amounted to £30.1m (2020: £15.5m loss). The gain
primarily resulted from a weakening of the euro by 7 cents (2020: strengthened by 6 cents) offset by a
strengthening of the US dollar by 1 cent (2020: weakened by 4 cents). Included within the net decrease in
cash and cash equivalents is £19.1m (2020: £4.2m) cash paid on debt-related foreign exchange forward
contracts (which is included within financing activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement) and £nil
(2020: £27.9m) settlement paid on the Synthetic Borrowing Unit (SBU), which was closed out in August 2020.
The total borrowings cash decrease of £1,149.2m includes £166.6m (2020: £1,352.2m) debt repayment
(included in financing activities), £15.1m (2020: £18.3m) settlement of interest accrued (included within
operating activities) and £972.2m decrease (2020: £503.4m increase) in overdraft offset by £4.7m proceeds
from new debt (included in financing activities).

C3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, short-term bank deposits and other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less (and subject to insignificant changes in value).
In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Cash at bank and in hand includes £6.6m (2020: £6.7m) of restricted cash. This cash is held in respect of
specific contracts and can only be utilised in line with terms under the contractual arrangements.
Cash at bank and in hand also includes £65.5m (2020: £51.0m) of cash held in countries with foreign
exchange regulations. This cash is repatriated to the UK where possible, if not required for operational
purposes in country.
Fair value is equal to carrying value for all cash and cash equivalents.

As far as it is practical to do so, cash balances are held centrally and are used first to repay borrowings
under the Group’s RCF before being placed on deposit.
C4. Other investments
Other investments held at year end mainly comprised term deposits maturing in more than three months from
the date that the deposit was placed. The weighted average effective interest rate earned is 0.4% (2020: 0.2%)
with £nil fixed for six months (2020: £170.6m) and £1.6m fixed for one year (2020: £1.6m). Fair value is equal to
carrying value for all other investments.

Includes a direct investment of £0.2m (2020: £0.2m) in a solar energy company in the US. This

In October 2020 the Group issued a €600m bond which was in part to be used to repay the €350m bond that
matured in October 2021. Following a successful tender offer €175m of the bond was repaid early. Part of the
proceeds (£172.2m) were swapped into sterling and deposited. On maturity in July 2021 the funds were
converted back to euros and used to repay the remaining €175m outstanding under the €350m bond using
the three months at par call option.
None of the financial assets are either past due or impaired in 2021 (2020: none).
C5. Derivative financial instruments
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. The method of recognising the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so,
the nature of the item being hedged. At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the
relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.
Certain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting. Typically the Group
will not designate financial instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near perfect offset is
expected between the change in value of assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of any derivative
instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the income statement. Where financial
instruments are designated for hedge accounting they are designated as either fair value hedge, net
investment hedge or cash flow hedge. When designating cross-currency swaps, the cost of hedging has
been excluded from the relationship and any movement in the fair value related to the cost of hedging is
deferred in equity and amortised over the life of the hedged item.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
RENTOKIL INITIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(a) Fair value hedge
These instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised
in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are
attributable to the hedged risk. There were no fair value hedges as at the year end date.
(b) Net investment hedge
These instruments are used to hedge exposure on translation of net investments in foreign operations. Any
gain or loss on the hedging instrument related to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other
comprehensive income; the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
income statement. In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the gains and losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are recycled through the income statement. All currencies are directly hedged
therefore the hedge ratio is considered to be 1:1.
The Group expects that the values of the hedged item and hedging instrument will move in opposite
directions in response to movements in the same hedged risk. Where there are sufficient levels of
denominated net assets, the critical terms are deemed to match.
The following net investment hedges were in place at 31 December 2021:
US dollar net investment hedge relationship: $807.0m (2020: $601.5m) cross-currency swaps notional and
$92.7m (2020: $80.4m) cross-currency swaps future interest cash flows have been used to hedge $899.7m
(2020: $681.9m) of the net assets of the US operating subsidiaries. The movement in the cross-currency
swaps due to changes in $/​£ exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes due to $/​£ in the
subsidiaries assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite
direction of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.
Euro net investment hedge relationship: €551.8m (2020: €567.9m) bonds are used to hedge the net assets of
the euro operating subsidiaries totalling €551.8m (2020: €567.9m). The movement in the bonds due to
changes in €/​£ exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes due to €/​£ in the subsidiaries
assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite direction of each
other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.
Australian dollar (AUD) net investment hedge relationship: AUD9.1m (2020: AUD9.6m) overdraft is used to
hedge AUD9.1m of the net assets of the AUD denominated operating subsidiaries. The movement in the
overdraft balance due to changes in AUD/GBP exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes
due to AUD/GBP in the subsidiaries assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically
change in the opposite direction of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an
economic relationship.
Japanese yen (JPY) net investment hedge relationship: JPY1.2bn (2020: JPY1.2bn) cross-currency swap is
used to hedge JPY1.2bn of the net assets of the Japanese associate. The movement in the cross-currency
swaps due to changes in JPY/GBP exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes due to
JPY/GBP in the associate’s assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the
opposite direction of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic
relationship.
During the year there was a gain of £1.7m (2020: £0.7m) relating to ineffectiveness of net investment in
foreign entity hedges. The main source of ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge is the off-market value
of the cross-currency swaps used to hedge US dollar net assets at the hedge designation date.
Ineffectiveness due to changes in the counterparty credit risk was not material in the year and is expected to
remain so due to the Group’s policy of only using counterparties with a credit rating of A- and above.
For the year ended 31 December 2021, the amount in comprehensive income related to net investment hedge
accounting was a gain of £15.0m (2020: £17.2m loss).

(c) Cash flow hedge
These instruments are used to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction, or a change in the cash flows of
a recognised asset or liability. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the
effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is
immediately recognised in the income statement. The gains or losses that are recognised in comprehensive
income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the
income statement. In the event that the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated
gains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately recognised in the income statement. In
the event that the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of hedge
accounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are only recognised in
the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur. All cash flow
hedge relationships are hedges of a foreign currency risk and all currencies were directly hedged therefore
the hedge ratio is considered to be 1:1.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives (marked as ‘cash flow hedge’ in the table in
Note C6) in accordance with IFRS 9. Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have
been marked as ‘non-hedge’.
The hedged item, a euro bond, creates an exposure to pay interest annually and the principal at maturity. By
receiving the same amount at the same dates through a cross-currency swap, this exposure is eliminated.
Since the critical terms of the derivative and the hedged debt match (i.e., matching currencies,

payment dates and interest rate on the leg of the swap offsetting the bond), the change in value of the
derivative, excluding any basis risk, will be considered to completely offset the changes in the hedged cash
flow.
Any ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedge is taken directly to finance costs. During the year there was a
loss of £0.8m (2020: loss of £0.7m) from those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. The main source
of ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedge is the off-market value of the derivatives hedging the €400m bond
maturing in 2024 at the inception of the hedge relationship. Ineffectiveness due to changes in the
counterparty credit risk was not material in the year and is expected to remain the same because the Group’s
counterparties credit rating is A- and above.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to €340.0m (2020: €340.0m) of the €400m 2024 bond, €179.4m
(2020: €179.4m) of the €500m 2026 bond and €175.0m (2020: nil) of the €600m 2028 bond. The cross-currency
interest rate swaps are used as hedging instruments to hedge the volatility in the £/​€ exchange rate of the
bonds. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the amount in comprehensive income related to cash flow
hedge accounting was a gain of £13.2m (2020: £4.9m loss).

C6. Fair value estimation
All financial instruments held at fair value are classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive
the fair value. The following hierarchy is used:
Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as
prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices; and
Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The effective nominal value of foreign exchange swaps is £39.1m (2020: £192.6m) and foreign exchange
forwards is £33.9m (2020: £nil).
Given the volume of acquisitions and the variety of inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration
(depending on each transaction) there are not considered to be any changes in input that would have a
material impact on the contingent consideration liability.

C7. Analysis of bank and bond debt
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are classified
as current liabilities unless the Group has a continuing right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after the balance sheet date.

In September 2021 the Group amended its RCF to incorporate the switch from LIBOR to risk free rates. At the
same time financial covenants were permanently removed from the facility. The RCF was undrawn
throughout 2021. In 2020 the RCF was fully drawn from the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in mid-March but
was repaid in full before the end of June 2020. In August 2020 the Group extended its RCF until August 2025
with a one-year extension option.

currency profit and cash flows, which are mainly in euro and US dollar. As a result, the Group has swapped a
portion of the bonds it has issued into US dollars, thus increasing the effective hedged interest rate.
In November 2020, following a successful tender offer, the Group repaid 49.8% of the €350m bond that was
due in October 2021. The bond had a three months at par call option, which meant that the bond could be
repaid on 7 July 2021 without additional premium. In October 2020, the Group issued a new €600m eight-year
bond with a coupon of 0.50% under its EMTN Programme.
The Group considers the fair value of other current liabilities to be equal to the carrying value.

Interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
Interest payable on foreign exchange swaps including coupon interest payable for the year was £17.4m.
£3.7m has been reported in other comprehensive income due to hedge accounting.
Fair value loss on other derivatives relates to $335m SBU entered into since February 2019 ($170m in
February 2019 and $165m in July 2019) which did not qualify for hedge accounting. The instrument
provided an annual interest benefit of 1.9% of the outstanding principal and was closed out in August
2020 with a full-year loss of £26.2m excluding interest accrued.
Fair value loss on hedge ineffectiveness in 2020 includes £7.6m foreign exchange loss on euro bonds
not reclassified to reserves due to book value of the euro subsidiaries’ net assets being lower than the
designated bond liability (2019: £3.1m loss). The fair value gain on hedge ineffectiveness also includes
£4.0m of interest on the net investment hedge accounting of the €400m bond hedge reported in the
interest payable of foreign exchange (2019: £4.1m).

December 2021, but not recognised as a liability at year end, is £79.5m.
D2. Share capital
The Company’s share capital is made up of the shares that have been issued to its members, whether on, or
subsequent to, its incorporation. At the year end the Company’s issued share capital consisted of ordinary
shares of 1p each, with one voting right per share, as detailed below. The Company does not have a limited
amount of authorised capital.
During the year five million new shares were issued in relation to employee share schemes. The Company
does not hold any shares in treasury.

D3. Contingent liabilities
The Group has contingent liabilities relating to guarantees in respect of leasehold properties, pensions, third
parties, environmental issues, tax and litigation. The possibility of any significant outflows in respect of
these items is considered to be remote.
On 14 December 2021, the Group announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Terminix
Global Holdings, Inc. subject to regulatory clearance and approval by shareholders of both companies. The
deal is anticipated to close during 2022 and total implied consideration at the date of the announcement was
estimated to be $6.7bn. The Group has a liability contingent upon successful completion of the transaction in
respect of professional fees. The undiscounted amount of the total payments that the Group could be
required to make is estimated to be up to £35m.
D4. Related party transactions
Subsidiaries
Related party transactions and outstanding balances between subsidiaries within the Group are eliminated in
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accordingly are not disclosed in this note.

Joint ventures and associate entities
The Group participates in a number of joint ventures where it has control and therefore it consolidates these
as subsidiaries in its Consolidated Financial Statements. All transactions between these entities and the
Group were transacted at arm’s length during the ordinary course of business and have been eliminated on
consolidation.

Nippon Calmic Ltd (49%) was an associate during 2020 and 2021 and its balances are disclosed in Note B6.
Boecker Public Safety Services - Qatar W.L.L. (24.5%) and Boecker Public Health Services (30%) became
associate entities when they were acquired by the Group on 3 August 2021 and their balances are disclosed
in Note B6. There are no significant transactions between associate entities and other Group companies.
Pension scheme
The Group bears some costs of administration and independent pension advice of the Rentokil Initial 2015
Pension Scheme. The total amount of costs in the year ended 31 December 2021 was £nil (2020: £0.2m; 2019:
£0.3m) of which £nil (2020: £0.2m; 2019: £0.3m) was recharged to the Scheme. At 31 December 2021, £nil
(2020: £nil; 2019: £0.1m) remained outstanding.
D5. Government grants
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic there were a number of government schemes made available
providing wage subsidies for companies that had to shut or scale down operations. The government
schemes have different conditions attached to them depending on the country in which they are available.
The Group presents the grants by deducting from the related expense, which in this case is the employee
benefit expense. The Group received a total wage subsidy of £1.0m in 2021 (2020: £14.2m; 2019: £nil).
D6. Post balance sheet events
On 24 February 2022 the buy-out of the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme completed when the insurance
policy with PIC was transferred to the individual members of the Scheme. Accordingly both the Scheme’s
assets and liabilities have been reduced by the policy value (£1,238.6m).

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
1. General information
The Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the UK with a
listing on the London Stock Exchange. The address of its registered office is Rentokil Initial plc, Compass
House, Manor Royal, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9PY.
The consolidated half-yearly financial information for the half-year to 30 June 2022 was approved on 27 July
2022 for issue on 28 July 2022.
These interim financial results do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 435 of the
Companies Act 2006.
2. Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB),
with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and in accordance with IAS
34 Interim Financial Reporting as contained in UK-adopted international accounting standards. The
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
issued by the IASB and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards.
Going concern
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts that demonstrate that the Group has sufficient liquidity to
meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these
Financial Statements.
Additionally the Directors have assessed severe but plausible downside scenarios, including the impact of
further lockdowns. The most severe downside scenario assumes a revenue decline of 30% against base
budget for a period of eighteen months in the next 24 months, which is considerably worse than the Group’s
actual performance in 2020 which saw a downturn of <30% for one month only.
In addition the Directors have considered the incremental impacts of a failed Terminix transaction. This
would potentially include the payment of committed deal costs and a break fee.
Consequently, the directors are confident that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and
therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.
3. Accounting policies
The preparation of the interim financial information for the half-year ended 30 June 2022 requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses,
assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the statement. If in the future such
estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the statement,
deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate
in the year in which the circumstances change.
There are no significant judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty made by management in
applying the Group’s accounting policies.
Significant seasonal or cyclical variations in the Group’s total revenues are not experienced during the
financial year.
Changes in accounting policies
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same
as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended

TABLE OF CONTENTS
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)
31 December 2021. The changes in accounting policies are also expected to be reflected in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 31 December 2022.
A number of new standards are effective from 1 January 2022 but they do not have a material effect on the
Group’s financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following amendments to standards with effect from 1 January 2022:
Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16
Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to IAS 37
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020
Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IFRS 3.
These standards have had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. Consequently,
no adjustment has been made to the comparative financial information as at 31 December 2021 or 30 June
2021. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not
yet effective.
4. Segmental information
Segmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Reporting
segments reflect the internal management organisation and reporting structures. Each segment is headed by
a Regional Managing Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the Group’s
Executive Leadership Team responsible for the review of Group performance. The operating businesses
within each segment report to the Regional Managing Directors.
From 1 January 2022 there was a change to the regional operating and business segment reporting structure
and financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 were retrospectively adjusted. This updated
reporting structure is reflected in the tables below.
Disaggregated revenue under IFRS 15 is the same as the segmental analysis below. Restructuring costs and
central and regional overheads are also presented centrally as they are not targeted or managed at business
segment level. The basis of presentation is consistent with the information reviewed by internal
management. Segment assets and liabilities are not provided because they are not reported to or reviewed by
the chief operating decision-maker, which is the Chief Executive Officer. Revenue and operating profit are
from Ongoing operations which is defined and reconciled to the nearest equivalent GAAP measure in the
tables below.

The tax charge for the period has been calculated by applying the effective tax rate which is expected to
apply to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 using rates substantively enacted by 30 June 2022.
A separate effective income tax rate has been calculated for each jurisdiction in which the Group operates
applied to the pre-tax profits for the interim period.
The reported tax rate for the period was 23.2% (H1 2021: 19.9%). The Group’s Effective Tax Rate (ETR) before
amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off items and the net interest
adjustments for the period was 21.8% (H1 2021: 20.4%). This compares with a blended rate of tax for the
countries in which the Group operates of 24% (H1 2021: 24%).

Legislation has been enacted to increase the standard rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% from 1
April 2023. As a result deferred tax balances have been calculated at 19% or 25% depending upon when the
balance is expected to unwind.
On 20 July 2022, HM Treasury released draft Pillar 2 legislation that would commence from 1 January 2024.
We are reviewing this draft legislation to understand the potential impact on the Group.
The Group’s ETR is expected to remain above the UK tax rate due to the proportion of overseas profits which
are taxed at a higher rate than UK profits. In the medium term the Group’s Adjusted ETR is likely to increase
towards the blended tax rate. The blended tax rate is expected to increase to 25% in 2023 when the UK tax
rate increases to 25%.
Total uncertain tax positions (including interest thereon) amounted to £56.7m as at 30 June 2022 (December
2021: £57.2m). Included within this amount is £11.3m (December 2021: £11.5m) in respect of interest arising
on tax provisions which is included in other payables.
Total tax payments for the period amounted to £32.2m (2021: £25.0m), an increase of £7.2m.

A deferred tax asset of £8.2m has been recognised in respect of UK losses (December 2021: £12.4m) carried
forward at 30 June 2022. This amount has been calculated by estimating the future UK taxable profits, against
which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax rates (substantively enacted as at the balance
sheet date) applicable for each year. Remaining UK tax losses of £34.6m have not been recognised as at 30
June 2022 as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the tax
losses can be offset.
At the balance sheet date the Group had tax losses of £67.0m (December 2021: £81.6m) on which no deferred
tax asset is recognised because it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available in
certain jurisdictions to be able to benefit from those tax losses.
6. Business combinations
The Group purchased 100% of either the share capital or the trade and assets of 31 companies and
businesses in the period. The Group acquires companies and businesses as part of its growth strategy.

profit targets being met.
The provisional fair value of assets and liabilities arising from acquisitions in the period are shown below.
The provisional fair values will be materially finalised in the 2022 financial statements. The fair values are
provisional as the acquisition accounting has not yet been finalised, primarily due to the proximity of the
acquisitions to the period end.

Acquired receivables are disclosed at fair value and represent the best estimate of the contractual cash flows
expected to be collected.
From the dates of acquisition to 30 June 2022, these acquisitions contributed £13.6m to revenue and £2.6m to
operating profit. If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2022, the revenue and operating profit of the
combined entity would have amounted to £1,589.7m and £171.9m respectively.
In relation to prior period acquisitions, there has been an adjustment to the provisional fair values resulting
in an increase to goodwill of £2.3m.
The Group paid £18.8m in respect of deferred and contingent consideration for current and prior year
acquisitions, resulting in the total cash outflow in the period from current and past period acquisitions, net
of £6.9m cash acquired, of £127.4m. In addition the Group acquired £0.5m of lease liabilities and £0.2m of
loans bringing the movement on net debt from acquisitions to £128.1m.

7. Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an intangible
asset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included in investments in associates.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually for impairment. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs identified according to country of operation
and reportable business unit. The way in which CGUs are identified has not changed from prior periods.
Newly acquired entities might be a single CGU until such time that they can be integrated. Gains and losses
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash
flow projections and fair value less costs to dispose if appropriate. The cash flow projections in year one are
based on financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the Group’s normal
planning process. Cash flows for years two to five use management’s expectation of sales growth, operating
costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability
for each CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth
rates (LTGR). The effect of climate change has been considered in the cash flows.
An assessment has been performed for all material CGUs at the half year to identify any possible indicators
of impairment. The assessment included a review of internal and external factors that have the potential to
significantly reduce the CGU value. No indicators of possible impairment have been identified as a result of
this assessment.

The directors have declared an interim dividend of 2.40p per share amounting to £44.7m payable on 12
September 2022 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 5 August 2022. The last day for DRIP
elections is 19 August 2022. The Company has a progressive dividend policy and will consider the level of
growth for 2022 based on the year-end results. These interim financial statements do not reflect this dividend
payable.
9. Retirement benefit obligations
Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of pension
schemes around the world covering many of its colleagues.
Buy-out of the Group’s principal scheme (the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom
(“the Scheme”)) completed on 24 February 2022, extinguishing a retirement benefit obligation of £1,152.1m
and the related insurance policy asset. At 30 June 2022 a retirement benefit asset relating to the Scheme
remains on the balance sheet amounting to £18.2m (December 2021: £18.2m). This represents the surplus
assets remaining in the Scheme that will be distributed to the Group on wind up of the Scheme. It remains
subject to certain estimates and assumptions made at the balance sheet date which could lead the overall
surplus available to change.
Schemes currently in an accounting surplus position total £20.8m (December 2021: £19.0m) and schemes
currently in an accounting deficit position total £31.6m (December 2021: £27.3m).

In addition the Group entered into a £120m uncommitted RCF facility with ING Bank N.V. which was drawn
down in full and repaid during the period. This facility was cancelled on 30 June 2022.
On 27 June 2022, the Group issued new bonds under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme, denominated in
euro and sterling, in three tranches to fund the cash settlement of the acquisition price of Rentokil’s takeover
of Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. (‘Terminix’).
The Company was the issuer of £400m maturing 2032 and Rentokil Initial Finance BV (RIFBV), a special
purpose vehicle set up specifically to issue euro bonds, issued €850m due 2027 and €600m due 2030. The
bonds issued by RIFBV are guaranteed by the Company in order to ensure pari passu ranking with other
debt where the Company is the borrower. RIFBV does not engage in any other business. The bonds contain
a mandatory call option, whereby the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to redeem each of the
bonds at 101% in the event the Terminix acquisition does not close by 13 March 2023. Following the
issuance of the bonds, the Company cancelled ‘Facility A’, which was a $2,000 million facility originally
entered into as part of a ‘Bridge-to-Bond’ facility to fund the acquisition.
The bonds contain call options that allow them to be redeemed early by the Group. Management has
performed analysis and concluded that separation of the embedded derivatives within each bond is not
required (nor permissible). Each bond is required to be classified in full at amortised cost.

12. Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in support of its hedging strategy which is to hold debt in
proportion to the Group profit and cash flow which are mainly EUR and USD.
For all financial instruments held by the Group, those that are held at fair value are to be classified by
reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value. The following hierarchy is used:
Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as
prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices; and
Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

and losses relating to the put option are recognised in OCI.
Given the volume of acquisitions and the variety of inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration
(depending on each transaction) there is not considered to be any change in input that would have a material
impact on the contingent consideration liability.

Stock (other than Excluded Shares) as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be entitled to
specify the number of such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder
makes a Cash Election or a Stock Election in accordance with (and subject to) this Section 2.05.
(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Form F-4 a form of election in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Form of Election”). At least twenty (20) Business Days prior
to the anticipated First Effective Time (the “Mailing Date”), Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
mail the Form of Election with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to all Persons who are record holders of
shares of Company Common Stock as of five (5) Business Days prior to the Mailing Date. The Form of
Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of
nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) to make a
Cash Election or a Stock Election. In the event that a holder fails to make a Cash Election or a Stock
Election with respect to shares of Company Common Stock held or beneficially owned by such holder
by the Election Deadline, then such holder shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect
to such shares (each such share, a “Non-Electing Company Share”). During the period from the mailing of
the Form of Election and the Election Deadline, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the
Form of Election available to all Persons who become at or prior to the Election Deadline (or who are
expected to become at or prior to the Election Deadline) record holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.
(c) Any holder’s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received
at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days
preceding the Closing Date (the “Election Deadline”), a Form of Election properly completed and signed
and accompanied by any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of
Election. After a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Non-Electing Company
Shares), no further registration of transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of
the Company, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election is properly revoked pursuant to
Section 2.05(e) and any procedures set forth in the Form of Election.
(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent
date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company
shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.
(e) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election
by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Cash
Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article X. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked, the shares of Company
Common Stock as to which such election previously applied shall be treated as Stock Electing Shares in
accordance with Section 2.05(a) unless a new election is submitted by the holder within the period
during which elections are permitted to be made pursuant to Section 2.05(d).
(f) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the reasonable determination of Parent, in the event
that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as
to whether or not Cash Elections and/or Stock Elections shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this Section 2.05 and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections and/or revocations were
received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Parent, acting reasonably, in the event that
the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make all computations
contemplated by Section 2.03(a), and absent manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and
binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent (subject in each case to the
consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any
rules as are consistent with this Section 2.05 for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock
Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash

(a) Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and Bidco shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) and enter into an exchange agent
agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent
Agreement”) for the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock. As of the First Effective
Time, in consideration of and in exchange for the issuance to Parent by Bidco of ninety-five (95) shares
of common stock of Bidco and the Cancellation, Parent shall (i) allot American depositary receipts
evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the Parent ADSs issuable
pursuant to Section 2.03(a), (ii) pay the cash amount payable pursuant to Section 2.03(a) in accordance
with the terms of Section 2.03(a) and the following provisions of this Section 2.06(a) and (iii) cause the
payment of any Vested Option Consideration or Vested Award Consideration (as applicable) in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.08. As of the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.06 through the Exchange Agent, (x) American
depositary receipts evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the Parent
ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and (y) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash amount payable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).
Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06(f) and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.10, as applicable. Promptly after the First Effective Time (and in no
event more than two Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to
the First Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to the First Effective Time and which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only on proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such
exchange. All certificates (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form) and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Exchange
Fund”. Parent shall cause, or shall procure that Bidco cause, the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or Bidco; provided, that such cash shall only be
invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement; provided, further, that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company
Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and, to the
extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause, or shall procure that
Bidco cause, to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent
on termination of the Exchange Fund.
(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, on (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
“agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, (A) the
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends
and distributions as contemplated by Section 2.06(f) and Section 2.10, as applicable. The Parent ADSs
constituting any of the Merger Consideration, at Parent’s option, shall be

in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depository receipt evidencing such
Parent ADSs is required under Applicable Law.
(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs or any
dividends and distributions as contemplated by Section 2.06(f) and Section 2.10, as applicable) is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax,
transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable.
(d) From and after the First Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the First Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the First Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and
distributions as contemplated by Section 2.06(f) and Section 2.10, as applicable) with respect thereto in
accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article II (including
this Section 2.06).
(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock 12 months following the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise
instructed by Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.05 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs
and any dividends and distributions as contemplated by Section 2.06(f) and Section 2.10, as applicable),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
Bidco, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.
(f) Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a properly completed and duly
executed letter of transmittal, or the transfer of any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in
this Section 2.06, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name
the Parent ADSs constituting all or part of the Merger Consideration have been registered, (i) in
connection with the payment of the Merger Consideration, (x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional amounts of Parent ADSs to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.10, and (y) the
aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent ADSs, with
a record date on or after the First Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such surrender or
transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the
amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent ADSs constituting
all or part of the Merger Consideration with a record date on or after the First Effective Time and prior to
the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender
or transfer. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs constituting all or part of
the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10,
shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof delivers a properly completed
and duly executed letter of transmittal or such Uncertificated Shares are transferred, as the case may be,
as provided in this Section 2.06.

the Debt Financing to less than the amount necessary, when taken together with other sources of funds
available to Parent and its Subsidiaries, to pay the Financing Amount at the Closing, (iii) adversely
affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or

Company informing itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the

to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (A) subject to compliance with this Section 6.02, engage in
negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its
Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to the Company or any of its

prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent pursuant to
this Section 6.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case
may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (x) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or

applicable provisions of this Section 6.02. A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)

after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal or
any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of
the Company, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Company
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request.
The Company shall thereafter (i) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any
material changes in the status and details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of
any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of any material written correspondence,
proposals or indications of interest relating to the terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition
Proposal or request provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of
any material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition
Proposal).
(d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Company Approval Time,
in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may,

in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under
Applicable Law, (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(iii); provided, that (A) the Company shall first notify
Parent in writing at least five Business Days before taking such action that the Company intends to take
such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any
financing commitments (in the form provided to the Company) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in
writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making any such
proposal), (B) the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent
and its Representatives during such five Business Day notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause
such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the
end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in

good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent, and shall
have determined that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal if the revisions committed to in writing by Parent were to be given effect
and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material
terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period
under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be
three Business Days (instead of five Business Days), during which time the Company shall be required
to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.02(d) anew with respect to each such additional
notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.
(e) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the Company
Approval Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response or relating to a Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law; provided, that (i) the Company shall first notify Parent in writing at least five Business Days
before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably
detailed description of such Company Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall
make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during
such five Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement in response to such Company Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or
relating to a Company Intervening Event unless, after the five Business Day period described in the
foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement during such five Business Day period, that the failure to take such action
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law.
(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any
and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing
as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or
negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Company Acquisition Proposal or with respect to
any indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (and any of its
Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such discussions or
negotiations to return or destroy all such information.

its Subsidiaries with the funds necessary for the Company to actually effect such payoff and
termination and (B) no such action shall be required unless it can be and is conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing; and
(viii) consent to the reasonable use of trademarks and logos of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries solely in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such trademarks and
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or is reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of

party; (ii) provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its

Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such
obligations, (ii) the Company’s breach of any of the covenants required to be performed by it under this
Section 6.03 shall not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) unless such breach is the primary cause of Parent being unable to obtain Debt Financing
required to consummate the Mergers and (iii) the receipt and availability of any funds or financing is not
a condition to Closing under this Agreement nor is it a condition to Closing under this Agreement for
Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing or any other financing. The Company will be
deemed to be in compliance with this Section 6.03 unless and until (i) Parent provides written notice to
the Company of any alleged failure to comply with this Section 6.03, which notice includes reasonable
detail regarding the cooperation required by the Company to cure such alleged failure (which notice
shall not require the Company to provide any cooperation that it would not otherwise be required to
provide under this Section 6.03) and (ii) the Company fails to take the actions specified in such notice
prior to the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days after receipt thereof and (y) the date that the conditions
set forth in Article IX (other than conditions that, by their nature, can only be satisfied at the Closing
(but subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied at Closing)) are satisfied.
(e) All confidential information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information as applicable to any number of Financing Sources
as would be reasonable and customary in connection with any Debt Financing; provided, that all
confidential information shared with Financing Sources shall be kept confidential and otherwise treated
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement or other confidentiality obligations that are
substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which, with respect to the
Financing Sources, may be satisfied by customary confidentiality undertakings in the context of
customary syndication practices from Financing Sources and ratings agencies).

(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval
(the “Parent Approval Time”), the Board of Directors of Parent receives a bona fide written Parent
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this
Section 7.02, the Board of Directors of Parent, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i)
contact the Third Party that has made such Parent Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or
clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of Parent informing itself about such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, (A)
subject to compliance with this Section 7.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources non-public
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1)

disclosure to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use

the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to the Company) is provided or made
available to the Company, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of

outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with Applicable Law; provided, that any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change shall be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section
7.02. A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection
with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of Parent, has been or is
reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request. Parent shall thereafter (i) keep the
Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and
details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such Parent Acquisition
Proposal or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt)
provide to the Company copies of any material written correspondence, proposals or indications of
interest relating to the terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request provided to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications
relating to the terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal).
(d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Parent Approval Time, in
response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with
this Section 7.02(d) and if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation
with Parent’s outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law, make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change; provided, that (A) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least
five Business Days before taking such action that Parent intends to take such action, which notice shall
include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form
provided to Parent) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions
thereof and the identity of the person making any such proposal), (B) Parent shall make its
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives during
such five Business Day notice period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the
Company to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Parent
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of Parent shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms
of this Agreement committed to in writing by the Company, and shall have determined that the Parent
Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the revisions
committed to in writing by the Company were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change,
from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Parent Superior
Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with
that described in clause (D) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (D) of this proviso
shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be three Business Days (instead of five
Business Days), during which time Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
Section 7.02(d) anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso.
(e) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the Parent

good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be

7.04(a), including any action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a D&O
Indemnified Party. No D&O Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened D&O Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought
by such D&O Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such D&O Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such D&O Claim, or

D&O Indemnifying Parties.
(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the First Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Organizational Documents, similar organizational
documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. For a period of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
organizational documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on liability of
directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of at least six years from the First
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any individuals who,
at or prior to the First Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid
“tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Mergers) of at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered
individuals as the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or
policies with a claims period of six years from the First Effective Time for D&O Claims arising from facts,
acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the First Effective Time; provided, that the
premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent of the aggregate annual amounts
currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the
“Maximum Premium”). If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the First Effective Time,
Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain such a tail policy; provided, that the premium for such tail
policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy cannot be
obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum
Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company shall only be required to obtain as much
coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum

pursuant to this Section 10.03, or if the Company receives any Parent Payment(s) and any applicable
Company Additional Amounts from Parent required pursuant to this Section 10.03, such payments shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party and its Subsidiaries
and their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates and
Representatives (and, in the case Parent is the paying party, the Financing Related Parties), and none of
the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners,
equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives (or, in the case Parent is the paying
party, the Financing Related Parties) shall have any further liability or obligation, in each case relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if (A) Parent, Bidco
or either Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this
Agreement and thereafter Parent receives any Company Payment(s) pursuant to this Section 10.03 or (B)
the Company receives any payments from Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub in respect of any breach
of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives any Parent Payment(s), the amount of such
Company Payment(s) or such Parent Payment(s), as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate
amount of such payments made by the party paying any Company Payment(s) or any Parent
Payment(s), as applicable, in respect of any such breaches (in each case, after taking into account any
Parent Additional Amounts or Company Additional Amounts, as applicable). The parties acknowledge
that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 do not constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if any party
fails to promptly pay any Company Payment or any Parent Payment due pursuant to this Section 10.03,
such party shall also pay any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (together with any irrecoverable VAT
incurred thereon, and including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled to
such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for
such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount. Any Company Payment or Parent
Payment not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount
is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such payment.
(j) Any Parent Payment and any Company Payment shall be VAT inclusive.
(k) The parties hereto intend that any payment of a Parent Payment, being compensatory in nature, shall
not be treated (in whole or in part) as consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and,
accordingly, Parent shall:
(i) file its relevant VAT return on the basis that the payment of any such Parent Payment falls
outside the scope of VAT; and
(ii) pay the full amount of any such Parent Payment free and clear of any deduction or adjustment
on account of VAT,
it being understood and agreed that if it is finally determined that any Parent Payment is (in whole
or in part) consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT then:
(A) Parent shall (1) subject, where sub-clause (C) below applies, to having received the
relevant amount from the Company as provided in sub-clause (C) below, promptly account for
and pay to HMRC such VAT together with any associated interest and penalties; and (2) use
its reasonable best efforts to recover (by refund, credit or otherwise) any such VAT at the
residual recovery rate generally applied by Parent in respect of input VAT incurred on its
overheads from time to time;
(B) the amount of such Parent Payment payable by Parent shall be reduced so that the sum of
(1) such Parent Payment (as so reduced) and (2) any VAT reverse charge thereon that Parent
certifies acting in good faith that it is not entitled to recover (by way of credit or repayment) as
input tax (together with any related interest or penalties in respect of such VAT reverse charge
but excluding any interest or penalties arising as a result of the unreasonable delay or default
of Parent), is equal to the amount of such Parent Payment that would be payable but for this
subclause (B) (the amount of such reduction being the “Adjustment Amount”); and
A-83 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(C) the Company covenants to reimburse Parent on written demand and on an after-Tax basis
an amount of such Parent Payment equal to the Adjustment Amount save to the extent that
such Adjustment Amount has previously been adjusted by way of refund of such part of such
Parent Payment, the due date for payment of which shall be five Business Days after the date
such written demand is received by the Company.
This Section 10.03(k) is subject to the provisions of Section 10.03(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(l) Any reference in Section 10.03(k) or Section 10.03(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to Parent
shall where applicable be regarded as referring to the representative member of any VAT group of which
Parent is a member, and “finally determined” shall mean determined by HMRC or, if such determination
is appealed, a court or tribunal in a decision or judgment in respect of which no right of appeal exists (or
in relation to which any periods for appeal have expired) or, whether or not such determination is
appealed, as provided in a binding agreement made with HMRC.
(m) The parties anticipate that any Company Payment shall be outside the scope of UK VAT and not
otherwise subject to VAT.
(n) For the purposes of Section 10.03(k) and Section 10.03(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, a
payment, covenant or indemnity being given on an “after-Tax basis” means that the amount payable
(the “Payment”) pursuant to such payment, covenant or indemnity (as applicable) shall be calculated in
such a manner as will ensure that, after taking into account: (A) any Tax required to be deducted or
withheld from the Payment (save to the extent that Parent has not provided a W-8BEN-E when it was
entitled to do so, and provision of a W-8BEN-E would have prevented such deduction or withholding
being required) and any additional amounts required to be paid by the payer of the Payment in
consequence of such withholding; (B) the amount and timing of any additional Tax which becomes (or
would become, but for the use of any credit or other relief which would otherwise have been available to
reduce the Tax liabilities of any member of the recipient’s Group) payable by the recipient of the
Payment as a result of the Payment’s being chargeable to Tax in the hands of that person; and (C) the
amount and timing of any Tax benefit which is obtained by the recipient of the Payment (or any member
of the recipient’s Group) to the extent that such Tax benefit is attributable to the matter giving rise to the
obligation to make the Payment or the receipt of the Payment (for which purposes, for the avoidance of
doubt, in the case of a reimbursement under Section 10.03(k)(ii)(C) or under Section 10.03(k)(2)(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the matter giving rise to the obligation to make the Payment is a
reference to the irrecoverable VAT or increased irrecoverable VAT attributable to the relevant Parent
Payment), the recipient of the Payment is in the same position as that in which it would have been if the
matter giving rise to the obligation to make a Payment had not occurred, provided that if any party to
this Agreement shall have assigned or novated the benefit of this Agreement in whole or in part or shall,
after the date of this Agreement, have changed its Tax residence or the permanent establishment to
which the rights under this Agreement are allocated then no Payment to that party shall be increased by
reason of the operation of clauses (A) through (C) (inclusive) to any greater extent than would have
been the case had no such assignment, novation or change taken place. In this Section 10.03(n),
references to “Tax” shall exclude “VAT” and references to a “W-8BEN-E” shall mean a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely, claiming the
benefits of, and establishing an exemption to withholding under, the income tax treaty between the
United States and the United Kingdom prior to such Payment.

without limitation dividends) payable in respect of it.

or to the person entitled to it by transmission, demanding payment and stating that if the
notice is not complied with the share may be sold.
Giving effect to
sale
25. To give effect to that sale the board may, if the share is a certificated share, authorise
any person to execute an instrument of transfer in respect of the share sold to, or in
accordance with the directions of, the buyer. If the share is an uncertificated share, the
board may exercise any of the Company’s powers under Article 8 to effect the sale of the

towards payment or satisfaction of so much of the sum in respect of which the lien exists
as is presently payable. Any residue shall (if the share sold is a certificated share, on
surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate in respect of the share sold
and, whether the share sold is a certificated or uncertificated share, subject to a like lien
for any moneys not presently payable as existed on the share before the sale) be paid to

value or premium). Each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days’ notice
specifying when and where payment is to be made) pay to the Company the amount
called on his shares as required by the notice. A call may be required to be paid by
instalments. A call may be revoked in whole or part and the time fixed for payment of a
call may be postponed in whole or part as the board may determine. A person on whom a
call is made shall remain liable for calls made on him even if the shares in respect of
which the call was made are subsequently transferred.
Time when call
made
28. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the
board authorising the call was passed.
Liability of joint
holders
29. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in
respect of it.
Interest payable
30. If a call or any instalment of a call remains unpaid in whole or in part after it has
become due and payable the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest
on the amount unpaid from the day it became due and payable until it is paid. Interest
shall be paid at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the share or in the notice of the
call or, if no rate is fixed, the rate determined by the board, not exceeding 15 per cent. per
annum, or, if higher, the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act), but the board may in
respect of any individual member waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.
Deemed calls
31. An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in
respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a
call duly made and notified and payable on the date so fixed or in
D-7 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
accordance with the terms of the allotment. If it is not paid the provisions of these
Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call
duly made and notified.
Differentiation on
calls
32. Subject to the terms of allotment, the board may make arrangements on the issue of
shares for a difference between the allottees or holders in the amounts and times of
payment of calls on their shares.
Payment of calls
in advance
33. The board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member all or any part of the moneys
uncalled and unpaid on any share held by him. Such payment in advance of calls shall
extinguish the liability on the share in respect of which it is made to the extent of the
payment. The Company may pay on all or any of the moneys so advanced (until they
would but for such advance become presently payable) interest at such rate agreed
between the board and the member not exceeding (unless the Company by ordinary
resolution otherwise directs) 15 per cent. per annum or, if higher, the appropriate rate (as
defined in the Act).",550,551

become due and payable, the board may give to the person from whom it is due not less
than 14 clear days’ notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any
interest which may have accrued and any costs, charges and expenses incurred by the
Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice shall name the place where
payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in
respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.
Forfeiture for
non-compliance
35. If that notice is not complied with, any share in respect of which it was sent may, at
any time before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a
resolution of the board. The forfeiture shall include all dividends or other moneys
payable in respect of the forfeited share which have not been paid before the forfeiture.
When a share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be sent to the person who
was the holder of the share before the forfeiture. Where the forfeited share is held in
certificated form, an entry shall be made promptly in the register opposite the entry of
the share showing that notice has been sent, that the share has been forfeited and the
date of forfeiture. No forfeiture shall be invalidated by the omission or neglect to send
that notice or to make those entries.
Sale of forfeited
shares
36. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, a forfeited share shall be deemed to
belong to the Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such
terms and in such manner as the board determines, either to the person who was the
holder before the forfeiture or to any other person. At any time before sale, re-allotment
or other disposal, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the board thinks fit.
Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share held in certificated form is to be
transferred to any person, the board may authorise any person to execute an instrument
of transfer of the share to that person. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited
share held in uncertificated form is to be transferred to any person, the board may
exercise any of the Company’s powers under Article 8. The Company may receive the
consideration given for the share on its disposal and may register the transferee as
holder of the share.
Liability following
forfeiture
37. A person shall cease to be a member in respect of any share which has been forfeited
and shall, if the share is a certificated share, surrender the certificate for any forfeited
share to the Company for cancellation. The person shall remain liable to the Company
for all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him

41. Without prejudice to any power of the Company to register as shareholder a person
to whom the right to any share has been transmitted by operation of law, the instrument
of transfer of a certificated share may be in any usual form or in any other form which
the board may approve. An instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the

register the transfer of a certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that the
refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on an
open and proper basis.
Invalid transfers
of certificated
shares
43. The board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless the
instrument of transfer:
is lodged, duly stamped (if stampable), at the office or at another place appointed
by the board accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it relates and
such other evidence as the board may reasonably require to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer;
is in respect of only one class of shares; and
is in favour of not more than four transferees.

48. If a member dies, the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his
personal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint
holders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his
interest. Nothing in these Articles shall release the estate of a deceased member
(whether a sole or joint holder) from any liability in respect of any share held by him.
Elections
permitted
49. A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share may, on production of any
evidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board, elect either to become the
holder of the share or to have another person nominated by him registered as the
transferee. If he elects to become the holder he shall send notice to the Company to that
effect. If he elects to have another person registered and the share is a certificated share,
he shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person. If he elects to have
himself or another person registered and the share is an uncertificated share, he shall
take any action the board may require (including without limitation the execution of any
document and the giving of any instruction by means of a relevant system) to enable
himself or that person to be registered as the holder of the share. All the provisions of
these Articles relating to the transfer of shares apply to that notice or instrument of
transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the member and the death or
bankruptcy of the member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not
occurred.
Elections required
50. The board may at any time send a notice requiring any such person to elect either to
be registered himself or to transfer the share. If the notice is not complied with within 60
days, the board may after the expiry of that period withhold payment of all dividends or
other moneys payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have
been complied with.

51. A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share shall, on production of any
evidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board and subject to the
requirements of Article 49, have the same rights in relation to the share as he would have
had if he were the holder of the share, subject to Article 182. That person may give a
discharge for all dividends and other moneys payable in respect of the share, but he
shall not, before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in respect of it to
receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any meeting of the Company or to receive
notice of, or to attend or vote at, any separate meeting of the holders of any class of
shares in the capital of the Company.

Article 65
arrangements
62. The notice shall specify any arrangements made for the purpose of Article 65 (making
clear that participation in those arrangements will not amount to attendance at the
meeting to which the notice relates).
General meetings
at more than one
place and/or by
means of
electronic
facilities
63. The board (or the chairman of the meeting in the case of an adjourned meeting) shall
determine the means, or all different means, of attendance and participation used in
relation to a general meeting and may resolve to enable persons entitled to attend and
participate in a general meeting (or an adjourned general meeting, as the case may be) to
do so by simultaneous attendance and participation:
at one or more satellite meeting places anywhere in the world; and/or
by means of electronic facility or facilities.
The members present in person or by proxy at satellite meeting places or by means of
electronic facility or facilities shall be counted in the quorum for, and entitled to vote at,
the general meeting in question. That meeting shall be duly constituted and its
proceedings valid if the chairman of the general meeting is satisfied that the facilities

TABLE OF CONTENTS
participate in the business for which the meeting has been convened;
hear all persons who speak (whether by the use of microphones, loudspeakers,
audio-visual communications equipment or otherwise) at the meeting; and
be heard by all other persons present at the meeting.
The inability of any member present in person or by proxy at such a satellite meeting or
by means of such electronic facility to participate in the business for which the meeting
has been convened, hear all persons who speak at the meeting or be heard by all other
persons present at the meeting on account of a breakdown in electronic facilities shall
not in any way affect the validity of the proceedings of the meeting. The chairman of the
general meeting shall be present at, and the meeting shall be deemed to take place at, the
principal meeting place.
Interruption or
adjournment
where facilities
inadequate
64. If it appears to the chairman of the general meeting that the facilities at the principal
meeting place or any satellite meeting place or any electronic facility have become
inadequate for the purposes referred to in Article 63, then the chairman may, without the
consent of the meeting, interrupt or adjourn the general meeting. All business conducted
at that general meeting up to the time of that adjournment shall be valid. The provisions
of Article 77 shall apply to that adjournment.
Other
arrangements for
viewing and
hearing
proceedings
65. The board may make arrangements for persons entitled to attend a general meeting or
an adjourned general meeting to be able to view and hear the proceedings of the general
meeting or adjourned general meeting and to speak at the meeting (whether by the use
of microphones, loudspeakers, audio-visual communications equipment or otherwise) by
attending at a venue anywhere in the world not being a satellite meeting place. Those
attending at any such venue shall not be regarded as present at the general meeting or
adjourned general meeting and shall not be entitled to vote at the meeting at or from that
venue. The inability for any reason of any member present in person or by proxy at such
a venue to view or hear all or any of the proceedings of the meeting or to speak at the
meeting shall not in any way affect the validity of the proceedings of the meeting.
Controlling level
of attendance
66. The board may from time to time make any arrangements for controlling the level of
attendance at any venue for which arrangements have been made pursuant to Article 65
(including without limitation the issue of tickets or the imposition of some other means
of selection) it in its absolute discretion considers appropriate, and may from time to
time change those arrangements. If a member, pursuant to those arrangements, is not
entitled to attend in person or by proxy at a particular venue, he shall be entitled to
attend in person or by proxy at any other venue for which arrangements have been made
pursuant to Article 65. The entitlement of any member to be present at such venue in
person or by proxy shall be subject to any such arrangement then in force and stated by
the notice of meeting or adjourned meeting to apply to the meeting.
Change in place
and/or time of
meeting
67. If, after the sending of notice of a general meeting but before the meeting is held, or
after the adjournment of a general meeting but before the adjourned meeting is held
(whether or not notice of the adjourned meeting is required), the board decides that it is
impracticable or unreasonable, for a reason beyond its control, to hold the meeting at the
declared place (or any of the declared places, in the case of a meeting in relation to
which the board has resolved to enable participation and attendance by way of satellite
meetings in accordance with Article 63) and/or by means of a declared electronic facility,
and/or at the declared time, it may change the place (or any of the places, in the case of a
meeting in relation to which the board has resolved to enable participation and
attendance by way of satellite meetings in accordance with Article 63) and/or electronic
facility, and/or postpone the time at which the meeting is to be held. If such a
D-13 
(a) 
(b) 
(a) 
(b) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
decision is made, the board may then change again the place (or any of the places, in the
case of a meeting in relation to which the board has resolved to enable participation and
attendance by way of satellite meetings in accordance with Article 63) and/or electronic
facility and/or postpone the time if it decides that it is reasonable to do so. In any case:
no new notice of the meeting need be sent, but the board shall, if practicable,
advertise the date and time of the meeting, and the means of attendance and
participation (including the place (or any of the places, in the case of a meeting in
relation to which the board has resolved to enable participation and attendance by
way of satellite meetings in accordance with Article 63) and/or any electronic
facility) for the meeting, in at least two newspapers having a national circulation
and shall make arrangements for notices of the change of place or places and/or
electronic facility or facilities and/or postponement to appear at the original place or
places and/or on the original electronic facility or facilities, in each case at the
original time; and
a proxy appointment in relation to the meeting may, if by means of a document in
hard copy form, be delivered to the office or to such other place within the United
Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with
Article 103(a) or, if in electronic form, be received at the address (if any) specified
by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with Article 103(b), at any time not
less than 48 hours before the postponed time appointed for holding the meeting
provided that the board may specify, in any case, that in calculating the period of 48
hours, no account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day.
Meaning of

notification where required by the Companies Acts or these Articles in relation to the
publication of a notice of meeting on a website, or to send a form of proxy where
required by the Companies Acts or these Articles, to any person entitled to receive it, or
the non-receipt for any reason of any such notice, resolution or notification or form of
proxy by that person, whether or not the Company is aware of such omission or non-
receipt, shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.
Security at
physical meetings
70. The board (and, at any general meeting, the chairman) may make any arrangement
and impose any requirement or restriction it or he considers appropriate to ensure the
security of a general meeting held at a physical place including, without limitation,
requirements for evidence of identity to be produced by those attending the meeting,
the searching of their personal property and the restriction of items that may be taken
into the meeting place. The board and, at any general meeting, the chairman are entitled
to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply with these arrangements,
requirements or restrictions.
Security at
electronic
meetings
71. If a general meeting is held partly by means of electronic facility or facilities, the
board (and, at a general meeting, the chairman) may make any arrangement and impose
any requirement or restriction that is:
necessary to ensure the identification of those taking part and the security of the
electronic communication; and
proportionate to the achievement of those objectives.

Quorum
72. No business shall be dealt with at any general meeting unless a quorum is present,
but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the choice or appointment of a chairman,
which shall not be treated as part of the business of the meeting. Save as otherwise
provided by these Articles, two qualifying persons present at a meeting and entitled to
vote on the business to be dealt with are a quorum, unless.
each is a qualifying person only because he is authorised under the Companies
Acts to act as a representative of a corporation in relation to the meeting, and they
are representatives of the same corporation; or
each is a qualifying person only because he is appointed as proxy of a member in
relation to the meeting, and they are proxies of the same member.
For the purposes of this Article a “qualifying person” means (i) an individual who is a
member of the Company, (ii) a person authorised under the Companies Acts to act as a
representative of the corporation in relation to the meeting, or (iii) a person appointed as
proxy of a member in relation to the meeting.
If quorum not
present
73. If such a quorum is not present within five minutes (or such longer time not
exceeding 30 minutes as the chairman of the meeting may decide to wait) from the time
appointed for the meeting, or if during a meeting such a quorum ceases to be present,
the meeting, if convened on the requisition of members, shall be dissolved, and in any
other case shall stand adjourned to such time and with such means of attendance and
participation (including at such place and/or by means of such electronic facility)as the
chairman of the meeting may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts,
determine. The adjourned meeting shall be dissolved if a quorum is not present within 15
minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting.
Chairman
74. The chairman, if any, of the board or, in his absence from the principal place of
meeting, any deputy chairman of the Company or, in his absence from the principal place
of meeting, some other director nominated by the board, shall preside as chairman of the
meeting. If neither the chairman, deputy chairman nor such other director (if any) is
present at the principal place of meeting within five minutes after the time appointed for
holding the meeting or is not willing to act as chairman, the directors present at the
principal place of meeting shall elect one of their number to be chairman. If there is only
one director present at the principal place of meeting and willing to act, he shall be
chairman. If no director is willing to act as chairman, or if no director is present at the
principal place of meeting within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the
meeting, the members at the principal place of meeting present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote shall choose a member present at the principal place of meeting in
person to be chairman.
Directors entitled
to speak
75. A director shall, notwithstanding that he is not a member, be entitled to attend and
speak at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of
shares in the capital of the Company.
Adjournment:
chairman’s
powers
76. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and
shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place
to place. In addition (and without prejudice to the chairman’s power to adjourn a meeting
conferred by Article 64), the chairman may adjourn the meeting to another time and place
without such consent if it appears to him that it would facilitate the conduct of the
business of the meeting to do so.
Adjournment:
procedures
77. Any such adjournment may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, be for
such time and place and with such other means of attendance and participation
D-15 (a) 
(b) 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(including at such place and/or by means of such electronic facility) as the chairman
may, in his absolute discretion determine, notwithstanding that by reason of such
adjournment some members may be unable to attend or participate in the adjourned
meeting. The discretion of the chairman shall include the discretion as to whether to
make arrangements for a satellite meeting place in respect of the adjourned meeting and
whether the meeting place of the adjourned meeting should be in a different country
from the original principal meeting place. Any member unable to be present at the
adjourned meeting may nevertheless appoint a proxy for the adjourned meeting either in
accordance with Article 103 or by means of a document in hard copy form which, if
delivered at the meeting which is adjourned to the chairman or the secretary or any
director, shall be valid even though it is given at less notice than would otherwise be
required by Article 103. When a meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more or for an
indefinite period, notice shall be sent at least seven clear days before the date of the
adjourned meeting specifying the time of, place, and means, or all different means, of
attendance and participation (including any satellite meeting place and/or electronic
facility) for the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be
transacted. Otherwise it shall not be necessary to send any notice of an adjournment or
of the business to be dealt with at an adjourned meeting. No business shall be dealt with
at an adjourned meeting other than business which might properly have been dealt with
at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place.
Amendments to
resolutions
78. If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good
faith ruled out of order by the chairman, the proceedings on the substantive resolution
shall not be invalidated by any error in such ruling. With the consent of the chairman, an
amendment may be withdrawn by its proposer before it is voted on. No amendment to a
resolution duly proposed as a special resolution may be considered or voted on (other
than a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent error). No amendment to a resolution
duly proposed as an ordinary resolution may be considered or voted on (other than a
mere clerical amendment to correct a patent error) unless either:
at least 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned
meeting at which the ordinary resolution is to be considered (which, if the board so
specifies, shall be calculated taking no account of any part of a day that is not a
working day), notice of the terms of the amendment and the intention to move it has
been delivered in hard copy form to the office or to such other place as may be
specified by or on behalf of the Company for that purpose, or received in electronic
form at such address (if any) for the time being specified by or on behalf of the
Company for that purpose, or
the chairman in his absolute discretion decides that the amendment may be
considered and voted on.
Methods of voting
79. A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting held partly by means of electronic
facility or facilities shall, unless the chairman of the meeting determines that it shall
(subject to the remainder of this Article) be decided on a show of hands, be decided on a
poll. Subject thereto, a resolution put to the vote at a general meeting shall be decided
on a show of hands unless before, or on the declaration of the result of, a vote on the
show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll, a poll is duly
demanded. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, a poll may be demanded
by:
the chairman of the meeting; or
(except on the election of the chairman of the meeting or on a question of
adjournment) at least five members present in person or by proxy having the right
to vote on the resolution; or
any member or members present in person or by proxy representing not less than

bonis or other person authorised for that purpose appointed by that court or official.
That receiver, curator bonis or other person may, on a show of hands or on a poll, vote
by proxy. The right to vote shall be exercisable only if evidence satisfactory to the board
of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote has been delivered to
the office, or another place specified in accordance with these Articles for the delivery of
proxy appointments, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the
meeting or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised provided that
the Company may specify, in any case, that in calculating the period of 48 hours, no
account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day.
Calls in arrears
89. No member shall be entitled to vote at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of
the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, either personally or by
proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all moneys presently payable by him in
respect of that share have been paid.
Section 793 of the
Act: restrictions
if in default
90. If at any time the board is satisfied that any member, or any other person appearing
to be interested in shares held by such member, has been duly served with a notice
under section 793 of the Act (a section 793 notice) and is in default for the prescribed
period in supplying to the Company the information thereby required, or, in purported
compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which is false or inadequate in a
material particular, then the board may, in its absolute discretion at any time thereafter
by notice (a direction notice) to such member direct that:
in respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred (the default shares,
which expression includes any shares issued after the date of the section 793 notice
in respect of those shares) the member shall not be entitled to attend or vote either
personally or by proxy at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders
of that class of shares or on a poll; and
where the default shares represent at least ∕4 of one per cent. in nominal value of
the issued shares of their class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury
shares), the direction notice may additionally direct that in respect of the default
shares:
no payment shall be made by way of dividend and no share shall be allotted
pursuant to Article 180;
no transfer of any default share shall be registered unless:
the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information
requested and the transfer when presented for registration is accompanied
by a certificate by the member in such form as the board may in its

days after the earlier of receipt by the Company of:
a notice of an approved transfer, but only in relation to the shares

notification under section 793 of the Act which either (i) names
such person as being so interested or (ii) fails to establish the
identities of all those interested in the shares, and (after taking into

Errors in voting
97. If any votes are counted which ought not to have been counted, or might have been
rejected, the error shall not vitiate the result of the voting unless it is pointed out at the
same meeting, or at any adjournment of the meeting, and, in the opinion of the chairman,
it is of sufficient magnitude to vitiate the result of the voting.
Objection to
voting
98. No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or
adjourned meeting or poll at which the vote objected to is tendered. Every vote not
disallowed at such meeting shall be valid and every vote not counted which ought to

the Company may determine that it has insufficient evidence of the authority
of that person to make, send or supply the appointment on behalf of that
holder and may treat the appointment as invalid.
Validity of proxy
appointment
105. A proxy appointment which is not delivered or received in accordance with Article
103 shall be invalid. When two or more valid proxy appointments are delivered or
received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting, the one that was last
delivered or received shall be treated as replacing or revoking the others as regards that
share, provided that if the Company determines that it has insufficient evidence to
decide whether or not a proxy appointment is in respect of the same share, it shall be
entitled to determine which proxy appointment (if any) is to be treated as valid. Subject
to the Companies Acts, the Company may determine at its discretion when a proxy
appointment shall be treated as delivered or received for the purposes of these Articles.
106. The Company shall not be required to check that a proxy or corporate
representative votes in accordance with any instructions given by the member by whom
he or she is appointed. Any failure to vote as instructed shall not invalidate the
proceedings on the resolution.
Rights of proxy
107. A proxy appointment shall be deemed to entitle the proxy to exercise all or any of
the appointing member’s rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the
Company. The proxy appointment shall, unless it provides to the contrary, be valid for
any adjournment of the meeting as well as for the meeting to which it relates.
Corporate
representatives
108. Any corporation which is a member of the Company (in this Article the grantor)
may, by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise such person as it
thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or at any separate
meeting of the holders of any class of shares. A person so authorised shall be entitled to
exercise the same power on behalf of the grantor as the grantor could exercise if it were
an individual member of the Company, save that a director, the secretary or other person
authorised for the purpose by the secretary may require such person to produce a
certified copy of the resolution of authorisation before permitting him to exercise his
powers. The grantor shall for the purposes of these Articles be deemed to be present in
person at any such meeting if a person so authorised is present at it.
Revocation of
authority
109. The termination of the authority of a person to act as a proxy or duly authorised
representative of a corporation does not affect:
whether he counts in deciding whether there is a quorum at a meeting;
the validity of anything he does as chairman of a meeting;
the validity of a poll demanded by him at a meeting; or
the validity of a vote given by that person,
unless notice of the termination was either delivered or received as mentioned in the
following sentence at least three hours before the start of the relevant meeting or
adjourned meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on the same day as the
meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for taking the poll. Such notice of
termination shall be either by means of a document in hard copy form delivered to the
office or to such other place within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on
behalf of the Company in accordance with Article 103(a)or in electronic form received at
the address (if any) specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with Article

approved by the board pursuant to Article 144 and his relationship with that person
gives rise to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, the director shall not be
in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171 to 177
of the Act because he:
absents himself from meetings of the board at which any matter relating to the
conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be discussed or from
the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise; and/or
makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to any
matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest sent
or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and information to be
received and read by a professional adviser,
for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest (or possible conflict of
interest) subsists.

principle or rule of law which may excuse the director from:
disclosing information m circumstances where disclosure would otherwise be

referred to in Article 149, in circumstances where such attendance or receiving such
documents and information would otherwise be required under these Articles.",573,575

Convening
meetings
156. Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the board may regulate its proceedings
as it thinks fit. A director may, and the secretary at the request of a director shall, call a
meeting of the board by giving notice of the meeting to each director. Notice of a board
meeting shall be deemed to be given to a director if it is given to him personally or by
word of mouth or sent in hard copy form to him at his last known address or such other
address (if any) as may for the time being be specified by him or on his behalf to the
Company for that purpose, or sent in electronic form to such address (if any) for the time
being specified by him or on his behalf to the Company for that purpose. A director
absent or intending to be absent from the United Kingdom may request the board that
notices of board meetings shall during his absence be sent in hard copy form or in
electronic form to such address (if any) for the time being specified by him or on his
behalf to the Company for that purpose, but such notices need not be sent any earlier
than notices sent to directors not so absent and, if no such request is made to the board,
it shall not be necessary to send notice of a board meeting to any director who is for the
time being absent from the United Kingdom. No account is to be taken of directors
absent from the United Kingdom when considering the adequacy of the period of notice
of the meeting. Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. In
the case of an equality of votes, the chairman shall have a second or casting vote. Any
director may waive notice of a meeting and any such waiver may be retrospective. Any
notice pursuant to this Article need not be in writing if the board

(d)

so determines and any such determination may be retrospective.
Quorum
157. The quorum for the transaction of the business of the board may be fixed by the
board and unless so fixed at any other number shall be two. A person who holds office
only as an alternate director may, if his appointor is not present, be counted in the
quorum. Any director who ceases to be a director at a board meeting may continue to be
present and to act as a director and be counted in the quorum until the termination of the
board meeting if no director objects.
Powers of
directors if
number falls
below minimum
158. The continuing directors or a sole continuing director may act notwithstanding any
vacancies in their number, but, if the number of directors is less than the number fixed as
the quorum, the continuing directors or director may act only for the purpose of filling
vacancies or of calling a general meeting.
Chairman and
deputy chairman
159. The board may appoint one of their number to be the chairman, and one of their
number to be the deputy chairman, of the board and may at any time remove either of
them from such office. Unless he is unwilling to do so, the director appointed as
chairman, or in his stead the director appointed as deputy chairman, shall preside at
every meeting of the board at which he is present. If there is no director holding either of
those offices, or if neither the chairman nor the deputy chairman is willing to preside or
neither of them is present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting,
the directors present may appoint one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.
Validity of acts of
the board
160. All acts done by a meeting of the board, or of a committee of the board, or by a
person acting as a director or alternate director, shall, notwithstanding that it be
afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any director or any
member of the committee or alternate director or that any of them were disqualified from
holding office, or had vacated office, or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every
such person had been duly appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a
director or, as the case may be, an alternate director and had been entitled to vote.
Resolutions in
writing
161. A resolution in writing agreed to by all the directors entitled to receive notice of and
vote at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board (not being less than the
number of directors required to form a quorum of the board) shall be as valid and
effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the board or (as the case may be) a
committee of the board duly convened and held. For this purpose:
a director signifies his agreement to a proposed written resolution when the
Company receives from him a document indicating his agreement to the resolution
authenticated in the manner permitted by the Companies Acts for a document in the
relevant form;
the director may send the document in hard copy form or in electronic form to such
address (if any) for the time being specified by the Company for that purpose;
if an alternate director signifies his agreement to the proposed written resolution,
his appointor need not also signify his agreement; and
if a director signifies his agreement to the proposed written resolution, an alternate
director appointed by him need not also signify his agreement in that capacity.
Meetings by
telephone etc.
162. Without prejudice to the first sentence of Article 156, a person entitled to be
present at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board shall be deemed to be
present for all purposes if he is able (directly or by electronic communication) to speak
to and be heard by all those present or deemed to be present simultaneously. A director
so deemed to be present shall be entitled to vote and be counted in a quorum
accordingly. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where it is convened to be

participating is assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the
meeting is. The word meeting in these Articles shall be construed accordingly.
Directors’ power
to vote on
contracts in
which they are
interested
163. Except as otherwise provided by these Articles, a director shall not vote at a
meeting of the board or a committee of the board on any resolution of the board
concerning a matter in which he has an interest (other than by virtue of his interests in
shares or debentures or other securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company)
which can reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict with the interests of
the Company, unless his interest arises only because the resolution concerns one or
more of the following matters:
the giving of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of money lent or
obligations incurred by him or any other person at the request of or for the benefit
of, the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings;
the giving of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of a debt or obligation of
the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the director has
assumed responsibility (in whole or part and whether alone or jointly with others)
under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;
a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning an offer of shares,
debentures or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings
for subscription or purchase, in which offer he is or may be entitled to participate as
a holder of securities or in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of which he is to
participate;
a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning any other body
corporate in which he or any person connected with him is interested, directly or
indirectly, and whether as an officer, shareholder, creditor or otherwise, if he and
any persons connected with him do not to his knowledge hold an interest (as that
term is used in sections 820 to 825 of the Act) representing one per cent, or more of
either any class of the equity share capital (excluding any shares of that class held
as treasury shares) of such body corporate (or any other body corporate through
which his interest is derived) or of the voting rights available to members of the
relevant body corporate (any such interest being deemed for the purpose of this
Article to be likely to give rise to a conflict with the interests of the Company in all
circumstances);
a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal for the benefit of employees of the
Company or of any of its subsidiary undertakings which does not award him any
privilege or benefit not generally accorded to the employees to whom the
arrangement relates; and
a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning any insurance which
the Company is empowered to purchase or maintain for, or for the benefit of, any
directors of the Company or for persons who include directors of the Company.
Interests of
connected person

director
164. For the purposes of Article 163, in relation to an alternate director, an interest of his
appointor shall be treated as an interest of the alternate director without prejudice to any
interest which the alternate director has otherwise.

generally or in respect of any particular matter, any provision of these Articles
prohibiting a director from voting at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors.

resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members,
but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the board.
Interim dividends
176. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the board may pay interim
dividends if it appears to the board that they are justified by the profits of the Company
available for distribution. If the share capital is divided into different classes, the board
may:
pay interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with
regard to dividends as well as on shares which confer preferential rights with regard
to dividends, but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or
non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear;
and
pay at intervals settled by it any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to the
board that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.
If the board acts in good faith it shall not incur any liability to the holders of shares
conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an

payable shall be treated for the purpose of this Article as paid on the share. All
dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the
shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is
paid; but, if any share is allotted or issued on terms providing that it shall rank for
dividend as from a particular date, that share shall rank for dividend accordingly.
Dividends in

179. A general meeting declaring a dividend may, on the recommendation of the board,
by ordinary resolution direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution
of assets, including without limitation paid up shares or debentures of another body
corporate. The board may make any arrangements it thinks fit to settle any difficulty
arising in connection with the distribution, including without limitation (a) the fixing of

Resolution), offer any holder of shares the right to elect to receive shares, credited as
fully paid, instead of cash in respect of the whole (or some part, to be determined by the
board) of all or any dividend specified by the Resolution. The offer shall be on the terms
and conditions and be made in the manner specified in Article 181 or, subject to those
provisions, specified in the Resolution.
Scrip dividends:
procedures
181. The following provisions shall apply to the Resolution and any offer made pursuant
to it and Article 180.
The Resolution may specify a particular dividend, or may specify all or any
dividends declared within a specified period.
Each holder of shares shall be entitled to that number of new shares as are together
as nearly as possible equal in value to (but not greater than) the cash amount
(disregarding any tax credit) of the dividend that such holder elects to forgo (each a
new share). For this purpose, the value of each new share shall be:
equal to the average quotation for the Company’s ordinary shares, that is, the
average of the middle market quotations for those shares on the London Stock
Exchange pic, as derived from the Daily Official List, on the day on which such
shares are first quoted ex the relevant dividend and the four subsequent
dealing days; or
calculated in any other manner specified by the Resolution,
but shall never be less than the par value of the new share.
A certificate or report by the auditors as to the value of a new share in respect of
any dividend shall be conclusive evidence of that value.
On or as soon as practicable after announcing that any dividend is to be declared or
recommended, the board, if it intends to offer an election in respect of that
dividend, shall also announce that intention. If, after determining the basis of
allotment, the board decides to proceed with the offer, it shall notify the holders of
shares of the terms and conditions of the right of election offered to them,
specifying the procedure to be followed and place at which, and the latest time by
which, elections or notices amending or terminating existing elections must be
delivered in order to be effective.
The board shall not proceed with any election unless the board has sufficient
authority to allot shares in the Company and sufficient reserves or funds that may
be appropriated to give effect to it after the basis of allotment is determined.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The board may exclude from any offer any holders of shares where the board
believes the making of the offer to them would or might involve the contravention
of the laws of any territory or that for any other reason the offer should not be
made to them.
The dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of election has
been offered) shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect of which an election
has been made (the elected shares) and instead such number of new shares shall be
allotted to each holder of elected shares as is arrived at on the basis stated in
paragraph (b) of this Article. For that purpose the board shall appropriate out of
any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any reserve or fund
(including without limitation the profit and loss account), whether or not it is
available for distribution, a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the new
shares to be allotted and apply it in paying up in full the appropriate number of new
shares for allotment and distribution to each holder of elected shares as is arrived at
on the basis stated in paragraph (b) of this Article.
The new shares when allotted shall rank equally in all respects with the fully paid
shares of the same class then in issue except that they shall not be entitled to
participate in the relevant dividend.
No fraction of a share shall be allotted. The board may make such provision as it
thinks fit for any fractional entitlements including without limitation payment in
cash to holders in respect of their fractional entitlements, provision for the accrual,
retention or accumulation of all or part of the benefit of fractional entitlements to or
by the Company or to or by or on behalf of any holder or the application of any
accrual, retention or accumulation to the allotment of fully paid shares to any
holder.
The board may do all acts and things it considers necessary or expedient to give
effect to the allotment and issue of any share pursuant to this Article or otherwise
in connection with any offer made pursuant to this Article and may authorise any
person, acting on behalf of the holders concerned, to enter into an agreement with
the Company providing for such allotment or issue and incidental matters. Any
agreement made under such authority shall be effective and binding on all
concerned.
The board may, at its discretion, amend, suspend or terminate any offer pursuant to
this Article.
Permitted
deductions and
retentions
182. The board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to any member
in respect of a share any moneys presently payable by him to the Company in respect of
that share. Where a person is entitled by transmission to a share, the board may retain
any dividend payable in respect of that share until that person (or that person’s
transferee) becomes the holder of that share.
Procedure for
payment to
holders and
others entitled
183. Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid (whether
in sterling or foreign currency) by such method or combination of methods as the board,
in its absolute discretion, may decide. Different methods of payment may apply to
different holders or groups of holders. Without limiting any other method of payment
that the board may decide, the board may decide that payment shall be made wholly or
partly:
by inter-bank transfer or by electronic means or by any other means to an account
(of a type approved by the board) nominated by the holder in writing or in such
other manner as the board may decide; or

order of the holder.
Election if more
than one payment
method available
184. If the board decides in accordance with Article 183 that more than one method of
payment of a dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be used to pay
any holder or group of holders, the Company may notify the relevant holders:
of the methods of payment decided by the board; and
that the holders may nominate one of these methods of payment in writing or in
such other manner as the board may decide;
and if any holder does not nominate a method of payment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Article, the dividend or other moneys may be paid by such method as the board may
decide.
Notification if one
payment method
available
185. If the board decides in accordance with Article 183 that only one method of
payment of a dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be used to pay
any holder or group of holders, the Company may notify the relevant holders
accordingly.
Failure to
nominate an
account
186. If the board decides that a payment of a dividend or other moneys payable in
respect of a share to any holder or group of holders shall be made to an account (of a
type approved by the board) nominated by the holder, but any holder does not nominate
such an account, or does not provide the details necessary to enable the Company to
make a payment to the nominated account, or a payment to the nominated account is
rejected or refunded, the Company shall treat the payment as an unclaimed dividend and
Article 192 shall apply.
Entitlement by
transmission
187. Without prejudice to Article 182, if a person is entitled by transmission to a share,
the Company may, for the purposes of Articles 183, 184 and 186, rely in relation to the
share on his written direction, designation or agreement, or notice to the Company.
Joint entitlement
188. If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any share, or are entitled by
transmission jointly to a share, the Company may (without prejudice to Article 182):
pay any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share to any one of
them and any one of them may give effectual receipt for that payment; and
for the purpose of Article 183, 184 and 186, rely in relation to the share on the
written direction, designation or agreement of, or notice to the Company by, any
one of them.
Payment by post
189. A cheque or warrant or any similar financial instrument may be sent by post:
where a share is held by a sole holder, to the registered address of the holder of the
share; or
if two or more persons are the holders, to the registered address of the person who
is first named in the register; or
without prejudice to Article 182, if a person is entitled by transmission to the share,
as if it were a notice to be sent under Article 205; or
in any case, to such person and to such address as the person entitled to payment
may direct by notice to the Company.
