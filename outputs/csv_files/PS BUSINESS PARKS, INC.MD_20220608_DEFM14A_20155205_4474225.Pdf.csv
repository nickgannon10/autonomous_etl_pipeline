The Proposals
The special meeting of our stockholders (the “special meeting”) will be held on July 15, 2022 at 10 a.m., Pacific time, at the Westin Pasadena at
191 N Los Robles Ave, Pasadena, CA 91101. At the special meeting, holders of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”),
as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 7, 2022, will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the Company
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “proposal to approve the Company Merger”), (2) a proposal to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Company Merger (the “proposal to approve the merger-related compensation”) and (3) a proposal to approve any
adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve
the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “proposal to approve adjournment of the special
meeting”).
Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought
before the special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All stockholders of record of shares of our Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 7, 2022, are entitled
to receive notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be
entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record
date. On the record date, there were 27,631,499 shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special
meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting.
Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special
meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date. Pursuant to our bylaws, the chairman of the special meeting may
adjourn the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, to a later date and time and place announced at the special meeting (subject to
certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not be held, without Parent’s consent,
on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).
-3-Table of Contents
Required Vote
Completion of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement requires approval of the Company
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Each common stockholder will be entitled to cast
one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. Because the
required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes
cast, if you fail to exercise your proxy or vote in person (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote,
such failure will have the same effect as voting against the proposal to approve the Company Merger.
Each of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the Mergers. For
the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to exercise your proxy or vote in person, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how
to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and
therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
The vote of the holders of our 5.250% Series X Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, 5.200% Series Y Cumulative Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 4.875% Series Z Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, which we refer to collectively as the
“Preferred Stock,” or depositary shares in respect thereof, is not required to approve any of the proposals at the special meeting and is not being
solicited.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of 399,620 shares of our Common Stock,
entitling them to exercise approximately 1.4% of the voting power of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and
executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of Common Stock that they own in favor of the proposal to approve the
Company Merger, in favor of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and in favor of the proposal to approve adjournment of the
special meeting.
In addition, Public Storage, solely in its capacity as a common stockholder of the Company and limited partner of the Partnership, Parent and
the Company have entered into a support agreement requiring Public Storage, among other things, to vote its shares of Common Stock in favor of
the proposal to approve the Company Merger (the “Support Agreement”). As of the record date, Public Storage beneficially owned 7,158,354 shares
of our Common Stock, entitling it to exercise approximately 25.9% of the voting power of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.
As of the record date, Public Storage, together (without duplication) with our directors and executive officers, beneficially owned 7,557,974 shares of
our Common Stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 27.4% of the voting power of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Proxies; Revocation
Any of our common stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of Common Stock by returning
the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by appearing and voting at the special
meeting in person. If the shares of Common Stock that you own are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should instruct
your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares of Common Stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee.

Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your
proxy by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy
with our Corporate Secretary or by your voting in person at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting alone will not be sufficient to
revoke a previously authorized proxy.

In connection with the Mergers, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”), the Company’s financial advisor, delivered to the Company’s
board of directors on April 24, 2022 an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 24, 2022, to the effect that, as
of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review
undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock in the Mergers was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated April 24, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Exhibit C
to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of J.P. Morgan’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion. The Company’s common stockholders are urged to read J.P. Morgan’s
opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s opinion was addressed to the Company’s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for
the purposes of its evaluation of the Mergers, was directed only to the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock in
the Mergers and did not address any other aspect of the Mergers. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be
paid in connection with the Mergers to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or the
Partnership, or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Mergers. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a
fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any of the Company’s common stockholders as
to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Mergers or any other matter. For a description of the opinion that the Company’s board of

Common Stock
At the Company Merger Effective Time, each share of our Common Stock (other than shares of our Common Stock that are owned by Parent or
any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or us, which will automatically be cancelled with no consideration being delivered in exchange thereof (the
“cancelled shares”)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be automatically converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. If we declare a dividend
determined by us to be reasonably necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the imposition of income or excise tax or
any other entity-level tax as permitted under the Merger Agreement (an “Additional Dividend”), the merger consideration will be decreased by an
amount equal to the per share amount of such Additional Dividend. Additionally, immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, we will
be required to pay a closing cash dividend (the “Closing Cash Dividend”) to holders of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on
the business day immediately prior to the closing date in an amount reasonably determined by the Company in consultation with Parent equal to or
in excess of the sum of (i) the amount required to be distributed to avoid the imposition of income or excise tax or any other entity-level tax for the
Company’s hypothetical short taxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers or the Company’s taxable year ended December 31,
2021 and (ii) the estimated accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, calculated pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations, for the
Company’s hypothetical short taxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers, so long as any such Closing Cash Dividend is no
greater than the cash available for distribution. The Closing Cash Dividend will also reduce the merger consideration per share by an amount equal
to the per share amount of such Closing Cash Dividend.

Preferred Stock
Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and each depositary share
issued pursuant to the deposit agreements for the Preferred Stock, representing one-thousandth of one share of Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be unaffected by the Company Merger and will remain outstanding in
accordance with their respective terms.
Company Options
Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our Common Stock (we refer to each as a
“Company Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in
an amount equal to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time multiplied by (2) the excess (if any) of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price applicable to the Company Option, less any
applicable withholding taxes. Each Company Option with a per share exercise price that exceeds the merger consideration will be cancelled for no
consideration.
Company RSU Awards
Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units (we refer to each as a “Company RSU Award”)
covering shares of our Common Stock granted under a Company equity plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective

In connection with the closing of the Mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $6.6 billion to be paid to the holders of our
Common Stock, including the holders of Company equity awards, and the holders of common units of partnership interest of the Partnership. In
addition, Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the Mergers, Parent expects to cause our outstanding indebtedness under
our revolving credit facility, if any, to be prepaid in full. As of May 19, 2022, we had $0 in aggregate principal amount of consolidated indebtedness
under our revolving credit facility.

Parent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the Mergers, a debt commitment letter from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Bank
of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Societe Generale Financial Corporation,
providing for debt financing through a CMBS loan and balance sheet loan in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $4.85 billion to be funded
on or after the closing of the Mergers, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in the debt commitment letter (which we refer to
collectively as the “debt financing”) and that it may seek to obtain additional debt financing in connection with the Mergers. In addition, it is
expected that the Sponsor and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger
consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity
financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements,
and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the Mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be
borrowed under the debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or
ground leased by us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests
in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for
similar financings.
The Merger Agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. For more

The “Go-Shop” Period: Solicitation of Company Acquisition Proposals
Until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on May 25, 2022, which we refer to as the “No-Shop Period Start Date,” we and our subsidiaries and
representatives had the right to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), including providing non-public information and data
regarding the Company to any person pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, and engage in any discussions or negotiations with any
persons and their respective representatives with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or potential Company Acquisition Proposal or interest
or potential interest with respect thereto, or otherwise cooperate with, assist or participate in, or facilitate any inquiries. Within one (1) business day
after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company was required to notify Parent of the identity of each person from whom the Company received a
Company Acquisition Proposal during such period, including any “excluded parties” as described below, and provide a copy of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and any other written terms or proposals. The Company and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives were
permitted to continue to engage in the activities described above with respect to any excluded party until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on June 4,
2022 subject to extension in certain circumstances as described under “The Merger Agreement—Company Acquisition Proposals; Non-
Solicitation.” An “excluded party” is a person or
-8-Table of Contents
group of persons from whom we or any of our representatives have received a written bona fide Company acquisition proposal after the date of the
Merger Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date that our board of directors determined in good faith prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date (after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as
defined in “The Merger Agreement — Company Acquisition Proposals”). The circumstances in which a person or group of persons ceases to be an
“excluded party” are described under “The Merger Agreement — Company Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation — Actions Prior to ‘No-Shop
Period Start Date’.” We refer to such Company Acquisition Proposal as a “qualified proposal.”
The “No-Shop” Period: No Solicitation of Company Acquisition Proposals
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, other than as permitted with respect to excluded
parties as described above, we have agreed to cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or communications with any person with respect to
any Company Acquisition Proposal and not to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer, request or
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, and, subject to certain exceptions, we are
not permitted to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide non-public information to a third party in connection with, any
Company Acquisition Proposals. However, we may, prior to obtaining the requisite vote of our common stockholders in favor of the proposal to
approve the Company Merger, engage in discussions or negotiations and provide non-public information to a third party which has made an
unsolicited written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal if the Company’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Company acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal.
Prior to obtaining the requisite vote of our common stockholders in favor of the proposal to approve the Company Merger, the Company’s

obligations with respect to the Parent termination fee and certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under the Merger
Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the guaranty.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Company entered into a Support Agreement with Public Storage,
who as of the record date owned 7,158,354 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, or approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s Common Stock, as well as 7,305,355 common units of partnership interest of the Partnership.
Pursuant to the Support Agreement, Public Storage has agreed, among other things, that at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company
or partners of the Partnership, and in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company or partners of the Partnership, it will
(a) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause any issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and common units of partnership interest of the
Partnership (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchange for any of the foregoing) beneficially owned by Public Storage, or that may
otherwise become beneficially owned by Public Storage during the term of the Support Agreement (collectively, the “Covered Securities”) to be
counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum, (b) vote or cause to be voted all of the Covered Securities in favor of adopting
the Merger Agreement and approving the Mergers and the transactions contemplated thereby and (c) vote or cause to be voted all of the Covered
Securities against any alternative acquisition proposal or any other action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, materially
delay, materially postpone or adversely affect the Mergers or other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or result in a breach in any
material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company or the Partnership under the Merger
Agreement or of Public Storage under the Support Agreement. Public Storage also

agreed not to transfer any Covered Securities during the term of the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement does not require Public Storage to
redeem any common units of partnership interest of the Partnership beneficially owned by Public Storage for shares of Common Stock.
Except with respect to certain provisions which shall survive termination, the Support Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest
of (i) the Partnership Merger Effective Time, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms or (iii) if there occurs any
amendment or modification to the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount or changes the form of consideration payable in any of the Mergers

We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Holders of shares of Common Stock may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’
rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of Common Stock in connection with the
Company Merger because, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise
such rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, determines that such rights apply. Our
board of directors has made no such determination.

We intend to treat the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, as a dividend distribution to holders of
shares of Common Stock to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Further, we intend to designate the Closing
Cash Dividend, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, as a “capital gains dividend” under Section 857(b) of the Code. Each of the
Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, will reduce the per share merger consideration by an amount equal to the per share
amount of such dividend.
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to you of the receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend, the Additional

As of June 8, 2022, three lawsuits have been filed by purported stockholders of the Company in connection with the Mergers. The complaints
generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company in connection with the Mergers fails to disclose allegedly material
information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs seek, among other things,
to enjoin the Company from consummating the Mergers, or in the alternative, rescission of the Merger Agreement, as well as attorney’s fees. For a
more detailed description of such litigation relating to the Mergers, see the section entitled “The Mergers — Litigation Relating to the Mergers.”
Although the ultimate outcome of the matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, the Company believes that the allegations in the complaints
are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Mergers may also be filed in the future.

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposed Mergers.
These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a common stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference,
including the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company, including the Partnership, by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. After the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been approved by our common
stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub II will merge with and into
the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership, and Merger Sub I will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the Surviving Company. The Mergers will occur at the time provided in the Merger Agreement.
For additional information about the Mergers, please review the Merger Agreement, attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document
governing the Mergers.
Q:
As a common stockholder, what will I receive in the Company Merger?
A:
For each outstanding share of Common Stock that you own immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, you will receive the merger
consideration, which is $187.50 in cash, without interest and less the per share amount of the Closing Cash Dividend (and any Additional Dividend)
and any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends or any other dividends with respect to the shares of Common Stock that I own?
A:
On February 2, 2022, our board of directors authorized and we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share of Common Stock for the
quarter ended March 31, 2022, which was paid in cash on March 31, 2022, to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on
March 16, 2022. Additionally, on April 29, 2022, our board of directors authorized and we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share of
Common Stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which will be payable in cash on June 30, 2022, to holders of record of our Common Stock at the
close of business on June 15, 2022. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may make, declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends to
holders of Common Stock and to holders of common units of partnership interest of the Partnership, in an amount of up to $1.05 per share or unit
(with declaration, record and payment dates consistent with historical declaration, record and payment dates from fiscal year 2021), including a pro
rata distribution in respect of any stub period.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement we are also permitted to authorize, declare and pay any Additional Dividend, which are dividends to the
holders of our Common Stock during the term of the Merger Agreement that are determined by us to be reasonably necessary to maintain our
status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the imposition of income or excise tax or any other entity-level tax. Additionally, immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, we will be required to pay the Closing Cash Dividend, which is a dividend to holders of record of our
Common Stock as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date in an amount reasonably determined by the
Company in consultation with Parent equal to or in excess of the sum of (i) the amount required to be distributed to avoid the imposition of income
or excise tax or any other entity-level tax for the Company’s hypothetical short
-16-Table of Contents
taxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers or the Company’s taxable year ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) the estimated
accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, calculated pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations, for the Company’s hypothetical short
taxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers, so long as any such Closing Cash Dividend is no greater than the cash available
for distribution. Each of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, will reduce the per share merger consideration received by
holders of Common Stock in the Company Merger by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend.
Q:
When do you expect the Mergers to be completed?
A:
If our common stockholders vote to approve the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and
assuming that the other conditions to the Mergers are satisfied or waived, it is currently anticipated that the Mergers will be completed in the third
quarter of 2022. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Mergers will take place on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions to the Mergers described under “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Mergers” (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Mergers, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or on such other date as
may be mutually agreed in writing by us and Parent. For further information regarding the timing of the closing of the Mergers, see “The Merger
Agreement — Effective Times; Closing Date.”
Q:
What happens if the Company Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Company Merger is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the Company Merger is not completed for any other reason, our
common stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, the Company
will remain a public company and shares of Common Stock and depositary shares with respect to the Preferred Stock will continue to be registered
under the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE, and our Common Stock, Preferred Stock (and depositary shares in respect thereof), equity awards
and partnership interests of the Partnership will remain outstanding. Upon a termination of the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, we
will be required to pay Parent the Company termination fee. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the Parent termination
fee upon a termination of the Merger Agreement.
Q:
If the Company Merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of Common Stock?
A:
Following the completion of the Company Merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your
portion of the merger consideration. Shortly after the Company Merger is completed, you will receive instructions describing how you may
surrender your shares of Common Stock for the merger consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by your broker,
bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect
the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the merger consideration.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will be held on July 15, 2022, at 10 a.m., Pacific time, at the Westin Pasadena at 191 N Los Robles Ave, Pasadena, CA 91101.
Q:
Who can vote and attend the special meeting?
A:
All holders of record of shares of Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 7, 2022, are entitled to receive
notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each common stockholder will be
entitled to cast one
-17-
Table of Contents
vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date.
The vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) is not required to approve any of the proposals at the
special meeting and is not being solicited.
Q:
What is the quorum requirement for the special meeting?
A:
The presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting
will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will
be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If you fail to submit a proxy prior to the special meeting or
to vote in person at the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will not be counted toward a quorum.
Q:
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the Company Merger?
A:
Approval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of
issued and outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Because the required vote for this
proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your
shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same
effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Company Merger.
Q:
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger?
A:
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this
proposal, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and
abstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve adjournments of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of any adjournment of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve
the proposal to approve the Company Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this
proposal, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and
abstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
Why is my vote important?
A:
If you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary
quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the proposal to approve the Company Merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of
the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the holders of issued and outstanding Common
Stock, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the approval of the Company Merger.

Table of Contents
Q:
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of the Company’s shares of Common Stock?
A:
The merger consideration of $187.50 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 15% to the volume weighted average share price over
the 60 days prior to announcement of the proposed transaction.
Q:
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
A:
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Company Merger, “FOR” the proposal to approve the
merger-related compensation, and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation payable to our
named executive officers?
A:
The SEC has adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or
become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Company Merger.
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation?
A:
The proposal to approve the merger-related compensation is a proposal separate and apart from the proposal to approve the Company Merger.
Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Mergers. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding
on us or our board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to
receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger, in accordance
with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interests in the Company Merger that are different than mine?
A:
Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the Company Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. See “The Merger — Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger” for additional information
about interests that our directors and executive officers have in the Company Merger that are different than yours.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the exhibits attached to this proxy statement, please
vote your shares of Common Stock or authorize a proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock in one of the ways described below as soon as
possible. You will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that you owned as
of the record date.
Q:
How do I cast my vote?
A:
If you are a holder of record of Common Stock on the record date, you may vote in person at the special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your
shares of Common Stock at the special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by marking, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card by
mail, or, if you
-19-
Table of Contents
prefer, by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy card. Specific instructions to be followed by
stockholders of record interested in authorizing a proxy via the Internet or by telephone are shown on the accompanying proxy card. Internet and
telephone procedures are designed to authenticate the stockholder’s identity and to allow stockholders to authorize a proxyholder to vote the
stockholder’s shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. A common stockholder that authorizes a vote through the
Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and
telephone companies, which will be borne by the stockholder.
Q:
How do I cast my vote if my shares of Common Stock are held of record in a “street name”?
A:
If your shares are held in a “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your intermediary regarding how you would like
your shares voted by following the voting instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee; or, if you want to participate in the
special meeting, you must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee.
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
A:
With respect to the proposal to approve the Company Merger, if you abstain from voting and fail to cast your vote in person at the special meeting
or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee,
it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Company Merger. With respect to the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation
and the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting, if you abstain from voting or you fail to cast your vote in person at the special
meeting or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
How will proxy holders vote my shares of Common Stock?
A:
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but
no direction is otherwise made, your shares of Common Stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the Company Merger, “FOR” the
proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting. Pursuant to the
Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the special
meeting.
Q:
What happens if I sell shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?
A:
If you held shares of Common Stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, you will retain your right to
vote at the special meeting, but not the right to receive the merger consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the
Company Merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares of Common Stock you previously owned.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you own shares of Common Stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it
is exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending the special
meeting and voting in person at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously
authorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares of Common Stock, the foregoing options for changing
your vote do not apply, and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers?
A:
We intend to treat the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, as a dividend distribution to holders of
shares of Common Stock to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Further, we intend to designate the Closing
Cash Dividend, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, as a “capital gains dividend” under Section 857(b) of the Code. Each of the
Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, will reduce the per share merger consideration by an amount equal to the per share
amount of such dividend.
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.
You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to you of the receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional
Dividends, if any, and the per share merger consideration received in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger in
light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws). For further
discussion, see “The Mergers — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
Q:
What rights do I have if I oppose the Mergers?
A:
If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the proposal to approve the Company Merger. You are not,
however, entitled to exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the
stockholder’s shares in connection with the Company Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement because, as permitted by
the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of
directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, determines that such rights apply. Our board of directors has made no
such determination. See “No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal.”
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed
with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov when
filed.
Q:
Have any stockholders entered into a support agreement in connection with the Company Merger?
A:
Yes. Public Storage, solely in its capacity as our stockholder and limited partner of the Partnership, has entered into the Support Agreement with
Parent pursuant to which it agreed, among other things, that at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company or partners of the Partnership, and
in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company or partners of the Partnership, it will (a) appear at such meeting or
otherwise cause any Covered Securities to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum, (b) vote or cause to be voted all
of the Covered Securities in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and approving the Mergers and the transactions contemplated thereby and
(c) vote or cause to be voted all of the Covered Securities against any alternative acquisition proposal or any other action that could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, materially delay, materially postpone or adversely affect the Mergers or other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the
Company or the Partnership under the Merger Agreement or of Public Storage under the Support Agreement. Public Storage also agreed not to
transfer any Covered Securities during the term of the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement does not require Public Storage to redeem any
common units of partnership interest of the Partnership beneficially owned by Public Storage for shares of Common Stock.

Table of Contents
As of the record date, the shares of Common Stock covered by the Support Agreement represented approximately 25.9% of the outstanding voting
power of our Common Stock.
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the special meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet. The special meeting will not be broadcast telephonically or over the Internet.
Q:
Where can I find more information about the Company?
A:
We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at
https://ir.psbusinessparks.com. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form
a part of, this proxy statement or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents
from us. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In addition to
the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, fax, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees.

PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE COMPANY MERGER
We are asking our common stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company (with the
Company surviving such merger) and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
For detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Company Merger and the Merger Agreement throughout this proxy
statement, including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Mergers” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is
attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement.
Approval of the proposal to approve the Company Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock
entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the
Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares of Common Stock “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares of
Common Stock, will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1. Because the required
vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to
vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the
same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Company Merger.
Approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the Mergers. In the event that this proposal is not approved, the Mergers cannot be
completed.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Company Merger.

our common stockholders to vote at the special meeting on an advisory basis regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K
concerning this compensation, subject to certain assumptions described therein, is presented in “The Mergers — Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Company Merger — Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Company Merger.”
The stockholder vote on executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors. Further, the
underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the
advisory vote, if the Mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable
to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger, in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to
such compensation. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Mergers.

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors to be exercised
at a special meeting to be held on July 15, 2022, at 10 a.m., Pacific time. The special meeting will be held at the Westin Pasadena at 191 N Los Robles Ave,
Pasadena, CA 91101.
Only holders of our Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the special meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If you are a holder of record, you will be able to attend the special meeting in person, ask a question and
vote.
The purpose of the special meeting is for you to consider and vote on the following matters:
1.
a proposal to approve the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of April 24, 2022, and as it may be amended from time to time, by and among the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
2.
a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger; and
3.
a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes
at the special meeting to approve the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought
before the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter is required to approve the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and for
the Mergers to occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its
entirety.",37,37

All holders of record of our Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 7, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of
and attend and vote at the special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote
on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there
were 27,631,499 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence in person or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will
constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted
as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If you fail to submit a proxy prior to the special meeting or to vote in person
at the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will not be counted toward a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect
that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date. Under our bylaws, the chairman of the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting, whether
or not a quorum is present, to a later date and time and place announced at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement,
including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days after the date
on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).

Completion of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement requires approval of the Company Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter by the holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each
matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. Because the required vote for this
proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to exercise
your proxy or vote in person (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote, such failure will have the same
effect as voting against the proposal to approve the Company Merger.
In addition, each of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the Mergers.
For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to exercise your proxy or vote in person, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how
to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and
therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
In order for your shares of Common Stock to be voted, if you are a common stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card,
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or vote in person at the special meeting.
The vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, or depositary shares in respect thereof, is not required to approve any of the proposals at the
special meeting and is not being solicited.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of 399,620 shares of our Common Stock,
entitling them to exercise approximately 1.4% of the voting power of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and
executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the Common Stock that they own in favor of the proposal to approve the Company Merger,
in favor of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and in favor of the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting. In
addition, Public Storage, solely in its capacity as our stockholder and limited partner of the Partnership, has entered into a Support Agreement pursuant
to which it agreed, among other things, that at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company or partners of the Partnership, and in connection with
any written consent of the stockholders of the Company or partners of the Partnership, it will (a) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause any Covered
Securities to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum, (b) vote or cause to be voted all of the Covered Securities in favor
of adopting the Merger Agreement and approving the Mergers and the transactions contemplated thereby and (c) vote or cause to be voted all of the
Covered Securities against any alternative acquisition proposal or any other action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, materially
delay, materially postpone or adversely affect the Mergers or other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or result in a breach in any
material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company or the Partnership under the Merger
Agreement or of Public Storage under the Support Agreement. Public Storage also agreed not to transfer any Covered Securities during the term of the
Support Agreement. The Support Agreement does not require Public Storage to redeem any common units of partnership interest of the Partnership
beneficially owned by Public Storage for shares of Common Stock. As of the record date, Public Storage beneficially owned 7,158,354 shares of our
Common Stock, entitling it to exercise approximately 25.9% of the voting power of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the
record date, Public Storage, together (without duplication) with our directors and executive officers, beneficially owned 7,557,974 shares of our Common
Stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 27.4% of the voting power of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Holders of record of our Common Stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following methods:
1.
mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail;
2.
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy
card; or
3.
appear in person and vote at the special meeting.
Regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your Common Stock as described above as
promptly as possible.
Under NYSE rules, all the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the special meeting. A
broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other
nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular
proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting
authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name” through a
broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your intermediary regarding how you would like your shares voted by following the voting instructions
you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee; or, if you want to participate in the special meeting, you must follow the instructions you receive
from your broker, bank or other nominee. Because the proposal to approve the Company Merger requires the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled
to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock, the failure to provide your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Company
Merger. Because the approval of each of (1) the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have
discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no
effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is present.",39,39

If you authorize a proxy, your Common Stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If no instructions are indicated
when you authorize your proxy, your Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of
directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Company Merger, “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting.
You may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the special meeting, in any of three ways:
1.
by delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date of the proxy that is being
revoked to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201;
-32-Table of Contents
2.
by delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by telephone or by Internet at a
date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares of Common Stock; or
3.
by attending the special meeting and voting in person.
Attendance at the special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own Common Stock in “street
name,” you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the broker, bank or other nominee
that is the registered owner of the shares.

telephone, fax, e-mail or otherwise, by our officers, directors and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation. We have
engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $15,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, and we have
agreed to indemnify D.F. King & Co., Inc. against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding

if the holders of a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock are not present at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum or if
we believe it is reasonably likely that the Company Merger and the other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement will not be approved at the
special meeting when convened on July 15, 2022, or when reconvened following any adjournment. Any adjournments may be made, without setting a

Our board of directors and senior management regularly review our performance and prospects in light of the current business, economic, capital
markets, and real estate environments, as well as developments in the multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex, and low-rise suburban office space and the
opportunities and challenges facing participants in those businesses. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential strategic
alternatives, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, the re-weighting of our portfolio of assets to industrial assets, joint ventures, spin-off
transactions, and business combination transactions, as well as remaining an independent public company. Our board of directors and senior
management have considered various challenges that we have faced as a public company, in particular the competitive environment for acquiring
industrial and industrial-flex assets and our close to zero tax basis in existing assets, making asset-by-asset dispositions inefficient from a tax perspective,
as well as the discount to estimated net asset value at which shares of Common Stock have recently traded and the implications of this discount on the
cost of obtaining capital to fund future acquisitions and growth.
Additionally, from time to time, the Chairman of the board of directors, Ronald L. Havner, and our senior management have engaged in discussions
with executives of other participants in the real estate industry, including Blackstone, regarding potential acquisitions or dispositions of assets or
portfolios of assets, as well as potential joint ventures. In January 2021, the Company and Blackstone engaged in discussions regarding the Company
acquiring a portfolio of industrial properties on the west coast of the United States that Blackstone planned to sell. Blackstone conducted an auction to
sell these properties, and, after preliminary discussions, the Company determined in March 2021 not to pursue the transaction because, among other
things, the competitive dynamic and resulting price expectations meant the acquisition would not be accretive to the Company.
In February 2021, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Havner, expressing that Blackstone would be interested in exploring a potential
acquisition of the Company, and requesting that the Company provide Blackstone with non-public information for such purpose. The conversation was
high level and no specific terms were discussed. On February 24, 2021, the Company and Blackstone entered into a confidentiality agreement, following
which the Company provided Blackstone limited property-level financial information. Over the next few weeks, Blackstone engaged in due diligence on
the Company and, on March 11, 2021, Blackstone’s representative telephoned Mr. Havner and informed him that, based on Blackstone’s due diligence
review, Blackstone would not be in a position at that time to offer to acquire the Company at a premium to its then-current stock price. On March 11, 2021,
the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock was $151.53 per share. Mr. Havner relayed this conversation to the other members of the board.
At a meeting of the Company’s board of directors on August 28, 2021, the board of directors reviewed our business performance and outlook in
light of general market conditions and considered opportunities and risks in our industrial, flex and office real estate businesses. The board discussed,
among other things, the Company’s strategic direction, as well as the real estate business environment. At the meeting, in light of the business and real
estate environment at the time, the board of directors determined to engage Eastdil, which has from time to time acted as a broker for real estate
transactions involving the Company, to assist the board in confidentially evaluating strategic options and assessing the value of the Company and its
assets. The board of directors directed management to assist Eastdil in preparing its evaluation, with the results of such evaluation to be presented to the
board at a meeting later in 2021.

On October 26, 2021, during a meeting of the Company’s board of directors, which was attended by the Company’s senior management, Eastdil
presented its assessment of the state of the real estate industry, including the industrial, flex, and office sectors. Representatives of Eastdil also presented
a preliminary valuation of the Company and the assets in the Company’s portfolio and discussed with the board possible approaches to creating value
through strategic acquisitions and dispositions The board discussed with management and Eastdil the benefits and risks of pursuing such opportunities,
and instructed management and Eastdil to continue reviewing such strategic acquisitions and dispositions.
On December 1, 2021, a representative of Blackstone contacted a representative of Eastdil to discuss the Company and the Company’s real estate
portfolio. Blackstone’s representative was aware that the Company had previously worked with Eastdil with respect to acquisitions and dispositions of
real estate assets. The representative of Blackstone indicated that Blackstone would be interested in discussing an acquisition of the entire Company.
Blackstone’s representative did not propose a valuation of the Company, stating that before proposing a purchase price, Blackstone would need access
to certain confidential information regarding the Company. Blackstone’s representative then asked that the representative of Eastdil communicate
Blackstone’s interest to the Company, including with respect to receiving confidential information of the Company.
Between December 2, 2021 and December 4, 2021, representatives of Eastdil conveyed their discussions with Blackstone to Mr. Havner and Dan
“Mac” Chandler, III, the Company’s then-President and Chief Executive Officer, including that Blackstone had expressed an interest in potentially making
a proposal to acquire the Company.
On December 8, 2021, during a meeting of the Company’s board of directors, which was attended by the Company’s senior management, Mr.
Havner and Mr. Chandler provided a summary to the other members of the board regarding Blackstone’s renewed interest in potentially acquiring the
Company and its request to receive access to certain confidential information of the Company in order to make a proposal to acquire the Company. After
discussion, the board of directors authorized members of management to provide confidential information about the Company to Blackstone in order to
determine Blackstone’s proposed purchase price for an acquisition of the Company.
On December 14, 2021, Mr. Chandler discussed with a representative of Blackstone the Company’s willingness to provide confidential information
of the Company so that Blackstone could provide a proposed purchase price, subject to the parties entering into a new confidentiality agreement given
the earlier confidentiality agreement was scheduled to expire on February 24, 2022. On December 19, 2021, the Company and Blackstone entered into a
new confidentiality agreement. Following the execution of the new confidentiality agreement, the Company granted access to an electronic data room to
representatives of Blackstone and Blackstone commenced its extensive due diligence review, including of property-level information, which continued
until the execution of the Merger Agreement.
On January 6, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Havner to update Mr. Havner on Blackstone’s extensive due diligence efforts and
informed Mr. Havner that Blackstone intended to propose a specific purchase price for the Company in the near future.
On January 18, 2022, the Company announced that Mr. Chandler would take a temporary leave of absence for health reasons unrelated to the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, effective January 17, 2022. The Company also announced that in connection with Mr. Chandler’s leave of absence, on
January 17, 2022, the board of directors appointed Stephen W. Wilson, a member of the Company’s board, to serve as interim President and Chief
Executive Officer and Maria R. Hawthorne, a member of the Company’s board, to serve as interim Chief Operating Officer, until Mr. Chandler returned from
his leave of absence. Subsequently on March 23, 2022, the Company announced that Mr. Chandler would step down as President and Chief Executive
Officer. On April 5, 2022, the Company announced that Mr. Wilson had been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and that he
would continue to serve as a member of the board of directors.

On February 3, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted representatives of Eastdil to orally communicate an indicative purchase price for all
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and all outstanding common units of partnership interest of the Partnership not owned by the Company of
$188.00 per share/unit in cash. The representative of Blackstone did not outline any other terms of the proposal. Thereafter on February 3, 2022,
representatives of Eastdil contacted Mr. Havner and Mr. Wilson to summarize the conversation with Blackstone’s representative, including the proposed
indicative purchase price.
On February 8, 2022, during a meeting of the Company’s board of directors, which was attended by the Company’s senior management, Mr. Havner
and members of the Company’s senior management provided an update on discussions with Blackstone, including the February 3, 2022 indicative
purchase price of $188.00 per share/unit. During the meeting, the board discussed, among other things, general real estate and economic conditions and
the Company’s potential opportunities and strategic direction, including potential monetization opportunities and the standalone case as an independent
public company, and the benefits and risks related to each, including those discussed at prior meetings of the board of directors. Following discussion,
the board determined that the Company should communicate to Blackstone that its indicative purchase price was too low and that, based on current
market conditions at the time, any indicative purchase price should be at least $200.00 per share/unit. Following further discussions, the board determined
to reconvene in the coming days to receive any updates and further discuss the indicative purchase price and potential next steps.
On February 9, 2022, Mr. Havner communicated to representatives of Eastdil the board of directors’ view that the indicative purchase price of
$188.00 per share/unit was too low at this time, and that any indicative purchase price should be at least $200.00 per share/unit. Representatives of Eastdil
subsequently communicated the board’s views to representatives of Blackstone.
On February 12, 2022, representatives of Blackstone contacted representatives of Eastdil to inform them that Blackstone was not prepared to offer
more than $188.00 per share/unit. Representatives of Eastdil subsequently communicated Blackstone’s unwillingness to increase the indicative purchase
price to Mr. Havner and Mr. Wilson.
On February 13, 2022, during a meeting of the Company’s board of directors, which was attended by the Company’s senior management, Mr.
Havner, Mr. Wilson, and other members of management provided an update on the discussions with Blackstone and Eastdil and continued their
discussion of Blackstone’s proposal, the general market conditions, and the Company’s performance and opportunities. Following discussion, the board
of directors authorized management to evaluate beginning a confidential process to explore potential strategic alternatives with the goal of enhancing
stockholder value, which could include a potential transaction such as a merger, business combination, sale, spin-off, dissolution and distribution of
assets, or other transaction, as well as the potential for the Company to continue operating its business as a standalone public company. In order to
facilitate this process, the board formed an ad-hoc transaction committee of the board of directors comprised of three independent directors (the
“Transaction Committee”), which would provide advice to members of the Company’s senior management on day-to-day matters involving this process
and assist in the selection of financial, legal, and other advisors as appropriate. The members of the board of directors named to the Transaction
Committee were M. Christian Mitchell, Gary E. Pruitt, and Robert S. Rollo, with Mr. Mitchell appointed Chairman of the Transaction Committee. Thereafter
on numerous occasions, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Wilson discussed various matters related to the potential transaction with Blackstone and the potential
strategic alternatives review process, as well as the Company’s standalone business plan, and Mr. Mitchell also discussed these matters with the other
members of the Transaction Committee.
On February 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by teleconference during which the Transaction Committee decided that Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”) should be retained by the Company to act as the Company’s legal advisor in connection with the Company’s
evaluation of strategic alternatives. Additionally, the Transaction Committee determined that, in addition to Eastdil, who would continue to serve as real
estate advisor to the Company and as a financial advisor, it would be advisable for the
-36-
Table of Contents
Company to retain an additional financial advisor. Later that week, after meeting with several candidates, based on the recommendation of the Transaction
Committee, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as co-financial advisor to the Company in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives. J.P.
Morgan was selected based on its qualifications, expertise and reputation in the industrial, industrial-flex and office sectors, and its knowledge of the
business and affairs of the Company and of potential counterparties.
On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine, which conflict escalated throughout the spring of 2022 and
continues as of the date of this proxy statement. Following commencement of the invasion, there was a rapid deterioration of the credit markets, including
as related to real estate in the United States, and borrowing costs associated with purchasing real estate continued to increase.
During the final week of February and the month of March, members of management worked with Eastdil and J.P. Morgan to prepare for a potential
process to explore potential strategic alternatives for the Company. Also during this period, members of management and the Company’s financial
advisors monitored market conditions in light of the war in Ukraine, including the substantial deterioration in the access and the cost of credit relative to
prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Members of management and the Company’s financial advisors continued to evaluate the potential strategic
alternatives in light of the macroeconomic environment, and compared those alternatives to the Company’s strategic business plan as a standalone public
company. Also during this time, members of management finalized the Company’s projections for 2022 through 2026, which we refer to as the “Company
Projections” (discussed in more detail under “—Forward Looking Financial Information”).
During March 2022, representatives of Blackstone continued to discuss with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil a potential acquisition of
the Company, taking into account the rapidly deteriorating economic environment and the rise of borrowing costs. Representatives of Blackstone
communicated that Blackstone was no longer willing to offer an indicative purchase price of $188.00 per share/unit, and, on several occasions, indicated
that given the deterioration in the credit markets, any purchase price may need to be less than $180.00 per share/unit. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Eastdil subsequently informed Mr. Wilson of these discussions, who regularly updated Mr. Havner and Mr. Mitchell and the other members of the
Transaction Committee regarding these discussions.
On March 18, 2022, at a meeting of the board of directors, Mr. Wilson provided an update on management’s work with J.P. Morgan and Eastdil
regarding the potential process to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company. Mr. Wilson described to the board of directors the various alternatives
that management and its advisors had identified, including the Company continuing to execute on its strategic plan and operating its business as a
standalone, public company, as well as potential transactions such as a merger, business combination, sale, spin-off, dissolution and distribution of
assets. Mr. Wilson also discussed with the board of directors the macroeconomic and real estate environments in general, including the substantial
deterioration in the credit markets that had occurred since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, and the impact such deterioration would have on any
potential purchaser of the Company or its real estate assets.
On March 25, 2022, Mr. Havner, a representative of Eastdil, and a representative of Blackstone met to discuss a variety of matters related to the real
estate industry. At that meeting, Mr. Havner asked the representative of Blackstone whether Blackstone was still interested in pursuing an acquisition of
the Company and, if so, at what price. Blackstone’s representative informed Mr. Havner that Blackstone was interested in an acquisition of the Company
and that their respective representatives should continue discussions in a bilateral manner, without the Company engaging with third parties. Mr. Havner
informed Blackstone’s representative that if the Company were to enter into bilateral negotiations with Blackstone regarding a transaction, he and the
other members of the board of directors would insist on the right of the Company to solicit alternative proposals during a “go-shop” period following the
execution of any definitive agreement with Blackstone.
On March 29, 2022, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Havner and representatives of Blackstone met via teleconference to further discuss Blackstone’s potential
acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Blackstone did not
-37-
Table of Contents
make a proposal during the discussion. Mr. Havner and representatives of Blackstone agreed that representatives of Blackstone would meet with Mr.
Wilson and additional representatives of the Company on March 31, 2022, during which meeting members of management would describe
underappreciated features of specific assets of the Company that the Company believed were likely undervalued in Blackstone’s model, and thus not
accurately reflected in any indicative purchase price.
On March 31, 2022, representatives of each of the Company, including Mr. Wilson, Blackstone, J.P. Morgan and Eastdil met via teleconference,
during which meeting members of management discussed the Company’s portfolio of underappreciated assets, and answered questions from
representatives of Blackstone regarding the Company’s assets, business strategy and financial outlook. At the conclusion of the meeting,
representatives of Blackstone indicated that they would provide an updated indicative purchase price shortly after the meeting.
On April 1, 2022, representatives of Blackstone, J.P. Morgan, and Eastdil continued to discuss the proposed transaction and the possible valuation
of the Company. During this discussion, representatives of Blackstone indicated that they would be prepared to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and all outstanding common units of partnership interest of the Partnership not owned by the Company for $185.00 per share/unit in cash
(the “April 1 Proposal”). Thereafter on April 1, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil informed Mr. Wilson, Mr. Havner, and members of the
Transaction Committee of the discussions with Blackstone, including the April 1 Proposal. Mr. Wilson, Mr. Havner, and the members of the Transaction
Committee agreed that they would discuss the April 1 Proposal at a meeting of the board of directors in order to determine a response.
On April 5, 2022, the board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of the Company’s senior management and representatives
of J.P. Morgan, Eastdil, and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Wilson and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil provided members of the board of directors with
an update on developments with respect to the strategic review, as well as discussions with Blackstone, including the April 1 Proposal. Additionally,
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil provided the board of directors with an update on the real estate market and macroeconomic conditions since
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the rapid deterioration of the credit markets, and the rising interest rate environment for borrowers.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the board their preliminary financial analysis of the April 1 Proposal, including their analysis of
Blackstone’s overall financial ability to acquire the Company, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the board its legal obligations in
connection with considering the possible sale of the Company. Following this discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of other
strategic alternatives that members of management and representatives of each of Eastdil and J.P. Morgan had discussed, including a potential separation
of the Company’s industrial-flex and office assets through the formation of a joint venture and/or taxable spin-off transaction. Members of the board of
directors further discussed the April 1 Proposal and potential responses, including in the context of the Company’s standalone plan, as well as potential
short- and long-term execution and strategic risks to the Company’s long-range financial plan on a standalone basis, including the deteriorating credit
markets and rising interest rate environment, as well as the execution risks associated with the strategic alternatives that J.P. Morgan and members of
management had identified. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also reviewed with the board other potential acquirors of the Company, including other
publicly traded real estate investment trusts, as well as financial sponsor buyers other than Blackstone.
Following this discussion, the board, management and advisors reviewed and discussed the risks to the Company and its business posed by
contacting other potential bidders before engaging in discussions with Blackstone, including: concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a
potential transaction would disrupt the Company’s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base
and potential stock price volatility, and the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of its size and
diverse portfolio of assets comprising multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex, and low-rise suburban office space (including as a result of the deterioration
in credit markets and the rising interest rate environment). As a result, the board determined that it was in the best interest of the
-38-
Table of Contents
Company and its stockholders to pursue a transaction with Blackstone with a price per share/unit of at least $185.00 per share in cash, but that any
definitive agreement with Blackstone must contain a “go-shop” provision or other mechanism that would permit the Company to solicit and entertain
potentially superior proposals from other bidders while having a binding contract with Blackstone. After further discussion of the best path forward to
maximizing value for the Company’s stockholders, the board of directors instructed management and the Company’s financial advisors to request that
Blackstone revise the April 1 Proposal to improve its price per share/unit, and suggested that they make a counteroffer of $190.00 per share/unit in cash,
and to inform Blackstone that the Company would require that any merger agreement include a go-shop provision.
On April 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil, acting at the direction of the board of directors, contacted a representative of
Blackstone to inform him that the Company was prepared to move forward with bilateral negotiations with Blackstone for an acquisition by Blackstone of
the Company, but that to do so Blackstone would need to improve the price per share/unit of its April 1 Proposal, and suggested $190.00 as a price that
the board of directors might find acceptable. Additionally, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil, acting at the direction of the board of directors,
informed Blackstone’s representative that any definitive agreement between the Company and Blackstone must include a go-shop provision.
On April 7, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Wilson to inform him that Blackstone would be making an offer to acquire the
Company for $187.50 per share/unit in cash. Thereafter, a representative of Blackstone emailed a letter to Mr. Wilson containing a non-binding proposal
(the “April 7 Letter”) for Blackstone to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at a value of $187.50 per share in cash. The April 7 Letter
also proposed that (i) the Company not be permitted to declare or pay any further dividends on its Common Stock prior to the closing of a transaction, (ii)
the Company’s Preferred Stock (and the depositary shares representing an interest therein) would remain outstanding following the closing of the
proposed transaction, and (iii) the merger agreement for any such transaction contain a customary no-shop provision. The April 7 Letter also stated that
Blackstone’s proposal was not subject to a financing condition. Mr. Wilson shared the April 7 Letter with the members of the board of directors, as well
as the Company’s financial and legal advisors.
On April 8, 2022, following discussion with other members of the board of directors, including Mr. Havner and Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson contacted a
representative of Blackstone to inform him that he would be sending the Company’s written response to the April 7 Letter, and that it would include a
purchase price of $188.00 per share/unit in cash, as well as the right of the Company to continue paying its regular, quarterly dividends/distributions on
the Common Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership up to $1.05 per quarter, including pro rata dividends or distributions for
any stub period prior to closing.
Following this call on April 8, 2022, Mr. Wilson emailed a letter to Blackstone’s representative containing the Company’s response to the April 7
Letter (the “April 8 Company Letter”), which stated that the Company was prepared to proceed with a transaction with Blackstone, subject to alignment
on the following key terms: (i) a transaction price of $188.00 per share/unit in cash for all of the outstanding common equity of the Company and the
Partnership, (ii) the right of the Company and the Partnership to continue paying their regular, quarterly dividends/distributions on the shares of Common
Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership of up to $1.05 per quarter, including pro rata dividends or distributions for any stub
period prior to closing, (iii) a go-shop period of 45 days after signing the merger agreement, (iv) a termination fee equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the
transaction, payable by the Company to Blackstone in the event that the Company terminated its agreement with Blackstone to enter into a definitive
agreement with a topping bidder, provided that such termination fee would be equal to 0.5% of the equity value of the transaction if the Company
terminated its agreement with Blackstone to enter into an agreement with a bidder that emerged during the 45-day go-shop period, and (v) the Preferred
Stock (and depositary shares representing an interest therein) would remain outstanding following the closing. The April 8 Company Letter also stated
that, if Blackstone and the Company aligned on the foregoing terms, the Company was willing to forego the right to specifically enforce Blackstone’s
obligation to close the transaction, consistent with the approach Blackstone has taken in its other
-39-
-39-
Table of Contents
acquisitions of publicly traded real estate investment trusts, provided that Blackstone agree to pay a reverse termination fee equal to 12% of the equity
value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) in the event Blackstone breached its obligation to close
the transaction when otherwise obligated to do so. Finally, the letter stated that the Company expected that if Blackstone and the Company aligned on
these key terms, the parties could negotiate definitive documentation expeditiously.
On April 9, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Wilson and stated that Blackstone had reviewed the April 8 Company Letter, and
was willing to agree to most of the key terms with certain modifications, which would be set forth in an updated proposal letter. In particular, Blackstone’s
representative noted that Blackstone was unwilling to permit the Company and the Partnership to declare or pay any dividends on the shares of Common
Stock or common units of partnership interest of the Partnership for the second quarter of 2022 and was only willing to permit a pro-rata dividend or
distribution at a rate of $1.05 per quarter for the period from July 1, 2022 through the closing of a transaction.
Following this discussion, on April 9, 2022, a representative of Blackstone emailed a proposal to Mr. Wilson containing Blackstone’s response to
the April 8 Company Letter (the “April 9 Blackstone Proposal”). In the April 9 Blackstone Proposal, Blackstone agreed to the terms of the April 8
Company Letter, including the price per share/unit of $188.00, with the following modifications: (i) the Company and the Partnership would not be
permitted to declare and/or pay any dividends/distributions on the shares of Common Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership
during the second quarter of 2022 and would only have the ability to declare and/or pay a pro rata dividend/distribution at a rate of $1.05 per quarter for
the period from July 1, 2022 through the closing, (ii) the go-shop period would last for 30 days, instead of 45 days, (iii) the termination fee payable from
the Company to Blackstone in the event that the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal from another bidder would be
equal to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock), provided that such termination
fee would be equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) if, within 40 days
of signing, the Company terminated its agreement with Blackstone and entered into an agreement with a bidder that made a proposal during the go-shop
period that the board determined in good faith prior to the end of the go-shop period constituted or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal, and (iv) the reverse termination fee payable by Blackstone to the Company in the event Blackstone breached its obligation to close the
transaction when otherwise obligated to do so would be 9% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the
Preferred Stock). Mr. Wilson shared the April 9 Blackstone Proposal with certain members of the board of directors, as well as the Company’s financial
and legal advisors.
Later on April 9, 2022, following discussion with certain other members of the board of directors, including Mr. Havner and Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson
contacted a representative of Blackstone and stated that the Company had reviewed the April 9 Blackstone Proposal, and that he believed the parties had
reached agreement on most key terms, but that the Company was unwilling to forego the Company’s and the Partnership’s right to continue declaring and
paying its regular, quarterly dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per quarter per share/unit, as well as pro rata dividends/distributions for any stub
period prior to closing. Mr. Wilson informed Blackstone’s representative that the Company’s written response to the April 9 Blackstone Proposal would
be forthcoming.
Following this call, on April 9, 2022, Mr. Wilson emailed a proposal to a representative of Blackstone containing the Company’s response to the
April 9 Blackstone Proposal (the “April 9 Company Proposal”). The April 9 Company Proposal agreed to the terms of the April 9 Blackstone Proposal
with certain modifications, including: (i) there would be no suspension of the Company’s or the Partnership’s right to declare and pay regular, quarterly
dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per share/unit, including a pro rata dividend or distribution for any stub period prior to closing, and (ii) the reverse
termination fee payable by Blackstone to the Company in the event Blackstone breached its obligation to close the transaction when otherwise obligated
to do so would be 10% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock).

Later on April 9, 2022, a representative of Blackstone informed Mr. Wilson that Blackstone was willing to agree to the terms of the April 9 Company
Proposal, including the right of the Company and the Partnership to declare and pay regular, quarterly dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per
share/unit, including a pro rata dividend or distribution for any stub period prior to closing, but that the purchase price per share/unit must be $187.50 to
partially account for the Company’s right to continue to pay its regular, quarterly dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per share/unit, including a pro
rata dividend or distribution for any stub period prior to closing.
Following receipt of Blackstone’s revised proposal, on April 9, 2022, Mr. Wilson discussed Blackstone’s proposal with certain other members of the
board of directors and the Company’s legal and financial advisors. Following discussion, Mr. Wilson and such other members of the board of directors
determined that, consistent with the board’s prior determination on April 5, 2022, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to
attempt to negotiate definitive documentation on terms consistent with those set forth in the April 9 Company Proposal, with a purchase price per
share/unit of $187.50. Mr. Wilson thereafter contacted Blackstone’s representative to notify him that the Company was prepared to proceed on this basis.
Beginning on April 10, 2022, the Company made available to Blackstone and its representatives certain additional due diligence information.
Thereafter, from April 10, 2022 through April 24, 2022, Blackstone, with the assistance of its advisors, continued to conduct due diligence on the
Company and its assets, including through calls with members of management.
On April 12, 2022, the board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of the Company’s senior management and representatives
of J.P. Morgan, Eastdil and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Wilson and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil provided the board of directors with an update on
the negotiations with Blackstone since the board had authorized Mr. Wilson on April 5, 2022 to pursue a transaction with Blackstone at a price per
share/unit of at least $185.00. The group discussed that Blackstone had agreed to a price per share/unit of $187.50, as well as to the Company and the
Partnership continuing to make regular, quarterly dividends/distributions in an amount of up to $1.05 per share/unit, including a pro rata
dividend/distribution with respect to any stub period prior to closing. The group discussed that, given that the approval of the Company’s common
stockholders would be required in any such transaction, any transaction with Blackstone would be unlikely to close during the second quarter of 2022,
and thus the right to pay a dividend during the second quarter of 2022 as well as a stub dividend for any stub period prior to closing would likely result in
common stockholders receiving at least $1.05 that they would not otherwise receive if the Company were not permitted to declare and pay a dividend for
the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, the group discussed the fact that Blackstone had agreed that any definitive documentation with respect to a
transaction would provide the Company the right to solicit and entertain proposals from bidders other than Blackstone during a 30-day go-shop period.
The board instructed Mr. Wilson and members of the Company’s senior management, along with the Company’s financial and legal advisors, to proceed
to negotiate definitive documentation with Blackstone consistent with the terms described to the board at this meeting, which documentation would
remain subject to final board approval.
On April 13, 2022, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, legal advisors to Blackstone, provided initial drafts to Wachtell Lipton of the proposed merger
agreement and the other transaction documents. Between April 13, 2022 and April 24, 2022, the parties’ respective management teams and legal and
financial advisors engaged in extensive negotiations regarding the terms of the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documentation. During
the course of these negotiations, areas of discussion and negotiation between the parties included, among other things, the representations and
warranties to be made by the parties, the Company’s obligations with respect to the operation of its business during the period between the signing of
the merger agreement and the consummation of the Mergers, the scope of the restrictions applicable to actions taken by the Company during the period
between the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the Mergers, the conditions to completion of the Mergers, the plans of the
surviving company following the consummation of the Mergers with respect to the Preferred Stock and depositary shares in respect thereof, the
termination

provisions and the triggers of the termination fee payable by the Company, and the provisions regarding the Company’s equity awards, employee benefit
plans, retention, severance and other compensation matters.
On April 18, 2022, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party A”) contacted Mr. Wilson and orally communicated an interest in acquiring the
Company. Mr. Wilson informed the representative of Party A that he would inform the board of such interest and inquired at what price would Party A be
willing to pursue such a transaction. The representative of Party A stated that Party A would need due diligence information regarding the Company, but
orally informed Mr. Wilson that the price could be up to as much as $200.00 per share/unit, subject to due diligence and obtaining necessary financing for
such a transaction. Mr. Wilson asked the representative of Party A to present its proposal in writing. Thereafter, Mr. Wilson informed Mr. Mitchell, Mr.
Havner, and the Company’s financial and legal advisors of the discussion with Party A.
On April 24, 2022, the board of directors held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of the Company’s senior management
and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Eastdil, and Wachtell Lipton. During this meeting, members of the Company’s senior management and its financial
and legal advisors reviewed the history of negotiations with Blackstone and the terms of the proposal by Blackstone and the associated transaction
documents. Mr. Wilson also informed the board of directors of his conversation with the representative of Party A, including the fact that Party A had not
presented the Company with a written proposal at that time and that Party A had not conducted any non-public due diligence on the Company. Members
of the Company’s senior management and the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil discussed the likelihood of a third party offering to acquire the
Company at a value at or above $187.50 per share of Common Stock, including whether Party A would be able to secure the financing necessary to
consummate a transaction of this size, in light of the rapid deterioration of the credit markets following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the rising
interest rate environment for borrowers. The board also discussed the timing consideration relating to such possible proposals, as well as the potential
opportunities and risks associated with rejecting Blackstone’s proposal and remaining a standalone entity or pursuing other strategic alternatives or
discussions with other third parties at that time, including concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the
Company’s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility.
Members of the board also discussed the Company’s ability during a 30-day go-shop period following the execution of the merger agreement to solicit
proposals from third parties, including Party A, and the ability of the Company to terminate its agreement with Blackstone to enter into an agreement with
another bidder, including Party A, if such a bidder made a superior proposal to acquire the Company. In addition, the board observed that the $110 million
company termination fee applicable to qualified proposals made during the go-shop period was not likely to preclude or discourage other interested
parties from submitting a superior proposal. Additionally, the board reviewed disclosures from J.P. Morgan regarding fees it had received or may in the
future receive from the Company and its affiliates, Public Storage and its affiliates, or Blackstone and its affiliates, and J.P. Morgan’s ownership of
common equity of the Company, Public Storage, Blackstone, and their respective affiliates. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed J.P. Morgan’s
financial analyses of the consideration provided for in the proposed merger agreement with Blackstone. Following its presentation, J.P. Morgan delivered
to the Company’s board of directors its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of our Common Stock in the Mergers was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of our Common Stock, as more fully described below in the section “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”. Also at the meeting,
representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a presentation summarizing the terms of the draft merger agreement and other transaction documents and
reviewed with the directors their legal obligations in connection with their consideration and potential approval of the transaction with Blackstone.
Following extensive discussion, the board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement, declared the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Company Merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
and determined to recommend the
-42-
Table of Contents
approval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to our stockholders.
Following the board’s approval, during the evening of April 24, 2022, the parties finalized and executed and delivered the Merger Agreement, the
guaranty, and the equity commitment letter. As required by Blackstone, the parties and Public Storage, the Company’s largest stockholder holding
approximately 25.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and 20.9% of the issued and outstanding common units of partnership
interest of the Partnership, also executed the support agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Public Storage agreed to vote all of its shares of
Common Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership in favor of the proposed transaction, not transfer its shares/units, and not
engage in solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals to the extent the Company is prohibited from soliciting such proposals under the merger
agreement with Blackstone. Thereafter, the transaction was announced before the opening of the financial markets in New York on April 25, 2022, in a
press release jointly issued by the Company and Blackstone. The press release announcing the transaction also noted that the merger agreement
included a 30-day go-shop period that would expire on May 25, 2022.
During the go-shop period, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil, acting at the direction of the board of directors, communicated with 43
prospective transaction partners in order to solicit such prospective transaction partners to make an offer or proposal that would constitute, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal. Of those 43 parties, the Company executed a confidentiality agreement with 12
parties (including Party A) and subsequently provided non-public information with respect to the Company to such parties. To date, no party (including
Party A) has made a Company Acquisition Proposal following the execution of the Merger Agreement.
The go-shop period expired at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on May 25, 2022.

In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Company Merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, and recommend approval of
the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to our stockholders, our board of directors consulted with the
Company’s senior management team, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material
factors which the board of directors viewed as supporting its decision:
•
the current and historical trading prices of our shares of our Common Stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $187.50 per share
in cash represents a premium of approximately 12% to the closing price of our Common Stock as of April 22, 2022, the last trading day prior
to the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 15% to the volume weighted average price of our
Common Stock over the 60 days prior to announcement of the proposed transaction;
•
the Company’s ability to continue declaring and paying its regular quarterly cash dividends on the Company’s Common Stock and Preferred
Stock without a reduction in the merger consideration;
•
the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including the Company’s need to frequently raise capital due to
the capital intensive nature of the Company’s business, the difficulty and cost of obtaining capital and the need to ensure qualified and
talented individuals are available to serve as members of the Company’s management team;
•
that a private company might be able to realize more value from the Company’s business than a public company and thereby pay a higher
price to acquire the Company, including the ability of private companies to use higher leverage to pursue growth that is more accretive, to
absorb near-term dilution from capital expenditures in favor of longer-term growth, and to fund developments without having to rely on the
volatility of equity capital markets;
-43-Table of Contents
•
the board’s belief that, in light of Blackstone’s strategic focus on acquiring industrial real estate assets and substantial available capital,
Blackstone was in the best position to offer the highest possible price for the Company;
•
the fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations and that we negotiated an increase by Blackstone from its
April 1, 2022 proposed price of $185.00 per share, and the board of directors’ belief that the merger consideration was the maximum price that
Blackstone was willing to pay;
•
the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of its size and diverse portfolio of assets
comprising multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex, and low-rise suburban office space;
•
the board’s belief that contacting other potential bidders prior to signing a definitive agreement with Blackstone would result in significant
risks to the Company and its business, including concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the
Company’s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price
volatility;
•
the board’s belief that soliciting other potential buyers prior to signing a definitive agreement with Blackstone could delay or jeopardize the
availability of Blackstone’s proposal;
•
the Company’s right under the Merger Agreement to a 30-day “go-shop” period, during which the Company may actively solicit additional
acquisition proposals from, and furnish information to and conduct negotiations with, third parties (including Party A), providing an
opportunity to determine if a third party is willing to pay a higher value per share than Blackstone;
•
the Company’s right under the Merger Agreement, in response to unsolicited acquisition proposals, to furnish information to and conduct
negotiations with third parties in certain circumstances;
•
the board’s right, under the Merger Agreement, to withhold, withdraw, modify, or qualify its recommendation that our stockholders vote to
approve the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, subject to
payment of a termination fee if Parent elects to terminate the Merger Agreement in such circumstances;
•
the Company’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing
for the implementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of a termination fee;
•
the fact that in certain circumstances a lower termination fee of $110 million (representing approximately 1.5% of the Company’s equity
value, including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) will be payable by the Company, and that the lower termination
fee of $110 million and the termination fee of $220 million (representing approximately 3% of the Company’s equity value, including the
aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) were viewed by the board of directors, after consultation with our outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances and not likely to preclude or discourage any other party (including
Party A) from making a competing acquisition proposal, particularly with respect to those parties that make a qualifying proposal during the
go-shop period;
•
the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our common stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity
immediately upon the closing of the Company Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing
equivalent value from the Company’s standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives involving transactions in which all or a
portion of the consideration would be payable in equity or involving portfolio transactions;

the belief that the Company Merger is more favorable to the Company’s common stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to
the Company, including remaining as an independent public

company, the feasibility of such alternatives, and the significant risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing such alternatives;
•
the board’s knowledge of the business, assets, operations, financial condition, earnings, and prospects of the Company, as well as its
knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which the Company and each of its businesses operate, including economic,
market and capital raising conditions;
•
the risks and uncertainties created by the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, including disruptions and dislocations to the equity
and debt capital markets, as well as the impact of the recent increase in interest rates, as well as the stated intention of members of the
Federal Open Market Committee to continue to increase interest rates in 2022;

the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company and being able to expand, or realize value from reducing, the size
of the Company’s portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions, and/or development, including, among other things, the challenges of
acquiring assets on an accretive basis in light of the increasingly competitive environment for industrial real estate assets, and the difficulty
and cost of obtaining capital to fund future activities due to the discount to estimated net asset value at which the Company’s Common
Stock has recently traded;
•
the belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate market are generally favorable, with prices for industrial and industrial-flex
assets being at or near historical highs while capitalization rates are at or near historical lows, and the likely possibility that interest rates
may continue to rise in the future, which may increase a buyer’s financing costs resulting in less favorable conditions for sale transactions
in the real estate markets;
•
the high probability that the Mergers would be completed based on, among other things, Blackstone’s proven ability to complete large
acquisition transactions, Blackstone’s extensive experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing condition, and the $735
million reverse termination fee (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s equity value, including the aggregate liquidation
preference of the Preferred Stock) payable to the Company if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment
is guaranteed by the Sponsor;
•
the financial analyses presented to the board of directors by J.P. Morgan and the April 24, 2022 oral opinion delivered by J.P. Morgan to the
board of directors, which was confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated April 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of April 24, 2022 and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P.
Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of our Common Stock in the Mergers was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor” (the
full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated April 24, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Exhibit C to
this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference);

the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which were reviewed by the board with our financial and legal advisors, and the fact
that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties;
•
the fact that the Company Merger would be subject to the approval of our common stockholders, and our common stockholders would be
free to reject the proposed transactions by voting against the Company Merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made
prior to the stockholders’ meeting (in certain cases subject to payment by the Company of a $220 million termination fee if the Company
subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, an acquisition proposal); and

•
the fact the Company’s three outstanding series of Preferred Stock, and associated depositary shares, would be unaffected by the Mergers,
and that we were informed by Parent that Parent currently intends for the Company to continue to have the depositary shares representing
the Preferred Stock listed on the NYSE with public reporting so long as there is at least $75 million aggregate liquidation value of Preferred
Stock outstanding.
The Company’s board of directors also considered a variety of risk and other potential negative factors in its consideration of the Merger
Agreement and the Mergers, including the following material potentially negative factors:
•
our inability, after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on May 25, 2022, to solicit competing acquisition proposals and the possibility that the
$220 million termination fee (or $110 million termination fee under certain circumstances) payable by us upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing bid to acquire us;
•
the fact that, following the Mergers, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders will
not participate in any future earnings or growth;
•
the fact that the Mergers might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions to the closing of the
Mergers;
•
the fact that if any of Parent, Merger Sub I, or Merger Sub II fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy its obligations under the Merger Agreement,
we are not entitled to specifically enforce the Merger Agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that our exclusive remedy, available if
the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, would be limited to a reverse termination fee payable by Parent in the amount
of $735 million (the payment of which is guaranteed by the Sponsor);
•
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Mergers, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Mergers;
•
the fact that an all-cash merger would be taxable to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that, under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or similar rights of an objecting
stockholder in connection with the Company Merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Mergers and the substantial time
and effort of management required to consummate the Mergers and related disruptions to the operation of our business;
•
the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the failure to complete the
Mergers, and/or actions that the Company may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the Merger Agreement could have an
adverse impact on our existing and prospective business relationships with customers and other third parties and on our employees,
including the risk that certain key members of the Company’s management might choose not to remain employed with the Company prior to
the completion of the Mergers, regardless of whether or not the Mergers are completed; and
•
the fact that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Mergers that are different from, or in addition to, our
stockholders generally (see “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger”).
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors
considered by the board. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including the
-46-
Table of Contents
Company Merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, and recommend approval of the Company Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to our stockholders, the board did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative
weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different
factors. The board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered, but determined that, in the aggregate,
the potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of approving the Company Merger, the Merger
Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking
statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements.”
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously determined and declared that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the
Company Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and approved the execution, delivery and performance of
the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Company Merger. Our board of directors
unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Company Merger, “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting.",50,54

While the Company has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, the Company has not, as a matter of course, otherwise
publicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings, or other results beyond the then current annual period and is especially wary
of making projections for extended periods due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future
periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the Company is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain
unaudited prospective financial information of the Company on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Mergers (the “Company Projections”), to
give the Company’s common stockholders access to the financial projections that were made available to our board of directors and J.P. Morgan in
connection with their consideration and evaluation of the Company Merger. The Company Projections were provided to J.P Morgan for its use and
reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to our board of directors and J.P. Morgan’s opinion as discussed in “—
Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”, and such use and reliance was approved by our board of directors. The Company did not provide the
Company Projections to Blackstone, but did provide certain property-level projected financial information to Blackstone in connection with Blackstone’s
due diligence review of the Company’s properties. The Company advised the recipients of the Company Projections that its internal financial forecasts
are subjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Company Projections or of this summary does not constitute an admission or representation by the
Company, J.P. Morgan, or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as an indication that our board of directors, J.P.
Morgan, the Company or its management, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the
achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and should
not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company
Projections.
The Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were based are subjective in many respects and
subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of the Company’s industry and based on actual experience and
business developments. The Company
-47-Table of Contents
Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Company performance, industry performance,
general business, economic, regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant
economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond the Company’s control. The Company Projections constitute forward-looking information and are
subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and for
actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company Projections will be realized or
that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected, and the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future
operating results and should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes
less reliable with each successive year. The Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which
they were prepared, including the Mergers, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the Company
Projections may have changed since the date the Company Projections were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly,
which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be achieved.
In addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Company Projections
were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of the Company, Blackstone or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each
of them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances
existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in
error (except, in the case of the Company, as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the
Company Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the Company Projections were prepared, as
well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the
Company Projections set forth below. The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and
other information contained in the Company’s public filings with the SEC. The Company urges all of its stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings
for a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”), the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the
Company Projections and, accordingly, neither Ernst & Young nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto. The Ernst & Young report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to the Company’s historical financial information. It
does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.
The Company has not made and makes no representation to any stockholder of the Company or to Parent, Merger Sub I, or Merger Sub II in the
Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company Projections or regarding the Company’s ultimate performance compared to the information
contained in the Company Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. None of the Company, Blackstone or any of our or their respective
affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy, or completeness of the Company Projections.

Company Projections
The Company’s management prepared the Company Projections with respect to the Company’s business, as a standalone company, for the fiscal
years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2026, except that unlevered free cash flow was calculated by J.P. Morgan using the cash net
operating income and adjusted EBITDA projected by the Company’s management.
The following is a summary of the Company Projections, with dollars in millions:

Cash Net Operating Income is defined as rental income less amortized amounts of deferred rent receivables (net of write-offs), in-place lease
intangibles, tenant improvement reimbursements, lease incentives and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
(2)
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Cash Net Operating Income less general and administrative expenses, other expenses and management, facility fee
and other income.
(3)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for taxes in lieu of shares, commercial capital expenditures, recurring
leasing costs and investment in multi-family and industrial development.
In addition, in connection with J.P. Morgan’s financial analyses and opinion as discussed in “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”, the
Company’s management provided J.P. Morgan two separate allocations of the Company’s projected cash net operating income for the year ending
December 31, 2022. The first allocation was done on an ‘As reported’ basis (Industrial, Office, Flex and Multifamily) in order to match the Company’s
public reporting of cash net operating income by property type. The second allocation was done on an ‘Asset type’ basis (using Industrial, Office and
Multifamily classifications only), where various adjustments were made to the ‘As-reported’ allocations in order to take into account the actual Office
usage in each property, as provided by the Company. For this second allocation, the Company’s reported ‘Industrial’ cash net operating income was
partly allocated as ‘Office’ to reflect the estimated office build-out of the Company’s industrial classified assets. Additionally, for the Company’s reported
‘Flex’ segment, the cash net operating income was reallocated to ‘Industrial’ and ‘Office’ based on the estimated build-out of industrial and office square
footage across the Company’s Flex portfolio. The final allocations are as follows, with dollars in millions:

The allocation by Asset Type takes into account the actual Office usage in each property, and excludes the Flex classification.
Cash Net Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure
do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Company Projections) in connection with a proposed
transaction like the Mergers when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial
measures to GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by J.P. Morgan for purposes of its opinion or by our board of directors in connection with its
consideration of the Company Merger. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the
Company Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The Company Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on the Company of the Mergers and do not attempt to
predict or suggest future results following the Mergers. The Company Projections do not give effect to the Mergers, including the impact of negotiating
or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the Mergers, the effect on the Company of any
business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed, or the effect of any
business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed, but that were instead
altered, accelerated, postponed, or not taken in anticipation of the Mergers. Further, the Company Projections do not take into account the effect on the
Company of any possible failure of the Mergers to occur.
Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor
Pursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers.
At the meeting of the board of directors of the Company on April 24, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the board of directors of the
Company that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock in the Mergers
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its April 24, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to
the board of directors of the Company, dated April 24, 2022, that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common
Stock in the Mergers was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated April 24, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Exhibit C to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s common stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was addressed to the Company’s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
Mergers, was directed only to the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock in the Mergers and did not address any other
aspect of the Mergers. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Mergers to the
holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or
-50-
Table of Contents
the Partnership or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Mergers. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a
fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any of the Company’s common stockholders as to
how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Mergers or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated April 24, 2022 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the
purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Mergers,
and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain
other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was
furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any
such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to
undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities,
nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared
based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company’s management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or
forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made
by the Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis.
J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P.
Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers will
be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Mergers.
The Company Projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by the Company’s management, as discussed more fully under the section
entitled “—Forward Looking Financial Information”. While the Company has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, the
Company does not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclose internal projections beyond the then current annual period, including of the type
provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the Mergers, and such Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of,
or with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with GAAP, published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The Company Projections reflect
numerous assumptions, many of which are difficult to predict, and may be beyond the Company’s control, including, without limitation, factors related to
general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the
-51-
Table of Contents
Company Projections. For more information regarding the use of the Company Projections and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the
section entitled “—Forward Looking Financial Information”.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.
Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P.
Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the Mergers, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Mergers to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company or the Partnership or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Mergers. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Mergers, or
any class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock in the Mergers or with respect to the
fairness of any such compensation.
J.P. Morgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of
the Company or any other alternative transaction prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, were determined
through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the
Company’s board of directors. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company’s board of
directors in its evaluation of the Mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company’s board of directors or management
with respect to the Mergers or the consideration, including the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its
opinion to the Company’s board of directors on April 24, 2022 and in the financial analyses presented to the Company’s board of directors on such date
in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with
rendering its opinion to the Company’s board of directors and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P.
Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and
in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.
Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Implied Capitalization Rate Valuation Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a sum-of-the-parts implied capitalization rate valuation analysis of
the Company, based on the projected cash net operating income of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022 (“2022E NOI”) allocated, at the
direction of the Company’s management, to the following asset types of the Company: Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties. Using publicly
available information, J.P. Morgan compared the selected financial data of the Company with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged
in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged in by the Company.
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan with respect to the Company’s Industrial properties were as follows:
•
Prologis, Inc.
•
Duke Realty Corp.
-52-
Table of Contents
•
Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.
•
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.
•
EastGroup Properties, Inc.
•
Terreno Realty Corporation
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan with respect to the Company’s Office properties were as follows:
•
Highwoods Properties, Inc.
•
Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan with respect to the Company’s Multifamily properties were as follows:
•
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust
•
Apartment Income REIT Corp.
•
Camden Property Trust
•
UDR, Inc.
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for the
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics
that are materially different from those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences
in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they
would affect the Company.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company with respect to the Company’s Industrial, Office and
Multifamily properties, the ratio of the consensus equity research analyst estimates for such company’s cash net operating income for the year ending
December 31, 2022 to consensus equity research analyst estimates for such company’s implied real estate value (the “Implied Capitalization Rate”).
Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected the following ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates for the Company’s Industrial, Office
and Multifamily properties:
Implied
Capitalization
Rates
Industrial
3.4
% -
4.0%
Office
7.0
% -
7.9%
Multifamily
4.0
% -
4.7%
J.P. Morgan then calculated ranges of implied equity values for the Company’s Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties by applying the
applicable ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates to the 2022E NOI allocated, at the direction of the Company’s management, to the Company’s Industrial,
Office and Multifamily properties.

After aggregating the ranges of implied equity value for the Company’s Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties, this analysis indicated the
following range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company’s Common Stock:
Implied Per Share Equity

Implied Capitalization Rate Valuation Analysis (Asset Type)

The range of implied per share equity values for the Company’s Common Stock was compared to (i) the closing price of the Company’s Common
Stock of $167.67 as of April 22, 2022, the trading day immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion dated April 24, 2022, and (ii) the offer
price of $187.50 per share of the Company’s Common Stock.
J.P. Morgan also conducted a sum-of-the-parts implied capitalization rate valuation analysis of the Company, based on the 2022E NOI of the
Company allocated, at the direction of the Company’s management, based on the Company’s following ‘as reported’ segments: Industrial, Flex, Office and
Multifamily.
Using the information and calculated ranges listed above for the Company’s Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties and, in the case of the
Flex segment, at the direction of the Company’s management, using the weighted average of the Industrial and Office Implied Capitalization Rates, which
was calculated by applying a 41% weighting to the Industrial Implied Capitalization Rates and a 59% weighting to the Office Implied Capitalization Rate,
J.P. Morgan selected the following ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates for the Industrial, Flex, Office and Multifamily segments based on its
professional judgment and experience:
Implied

Rates
Industrial
3.4

4.0%
Flex
5.5
% -
6.3%
Office
7.0
% -
7.9%
Multifamily
4.0
% -
4.7%
J.P. Morgan then calculated ranges of implied equity values for the Company’s Industrial, Flex, Office and Multifamily segments by applying the
applicable ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates to the 2022E NOI allocated, at the direction of the Company’s management, to the Company’s Industrial,
Flex, Office and Multifamily segments.
After aggregating the ranges of implied equity value for the Company’s Industrial, Flex, Office and Multifamily segments, this analysis indicated
the following range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company’s Common Stock:

The range of implied per share equity values for the Company’s Common Stock was compared to (i) the closing price of the Company’s Common
Stock of $167.67 as of April 22, 2022, the trading day immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion dated April 24, 2022, and (ii) the offer
price of $187.50 per share of the Company’s Common Stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value
per share for the Company’s Common Stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate during fiscal
years 2022E through 2026E based upon the Company Projections prepared by the Company’s management (as set forth in the section entitled “—
Forward Looking Financial Information”, which was discussed with, and approved by, the Company’s board of directors for use by J.P. Morgan in
connection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of this period by applying
perpetual growth rates ranging from 2.75% to 3.25%, based on guidance provided by the Company’s management, to estimates of the projected cash net
operating income for the Company at the end of fiscal-year 2026E, as provided in the Company Projections. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered
free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December 31, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 7.00% to 7.50%,
which ranges were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the
unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and other adjustments for the Company
as of April 12, 2022.
Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated the following range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the
Company’s Common Stock:
Implied Per Share Equity
Value
Low
High
Discounted Cash Flow

$202
The range of implied per share equity values for the Company’s Common Stock was compared to (i) the closing price of the Company’s Common
Stock of $167.67 as of April 22, 2022, the trading day immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion dated April 24, 2022, and (ii) the offer
price of $187.50 per share of the Company’s Common Stock.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the
analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were
merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value
of the Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving
at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether
any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered
the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of
the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as
described in the above summary is identical to the Company. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies
with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved
and other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company.

As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company
with respect to the Mergers and deliver an opinion to the Company’s board of directors with respect to the Mergers on the basis of, among other things,
such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it
operates.
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Mergers, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of up to
$32.0 million, $3.0 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent
and payable upon the consummation of the Mergers. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of outside
counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P.
Morgan’s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company and certain affiliates
of Parent, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as
joint lead arranger on the Company’s syndicated credit facility in August 2021, sole lead arranger on Blackstone’s, an affiliate of Parent, syndicated credit
facility in November 2021, joint lead bookrunner on Blackstone’s offering of debt securities in September 2021, and joint lead bookrunner on Blackstone’s
offering of equity securities in November 2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding
credit facilities of Blackstone, for which it receives customary compensation. In addition, during the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written
opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Blackstone’s portfolio companies for which J.P.
Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included providing debt syndication, equity
underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Blackstone’s portfolio companies. During the two years preceding the date of J.P.
Morgan’s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Public Storage, which owns
approximately 26% (or 7.2 million shares) of the Company’s Common Stock and would own approximately 41.4% (or 14.5 million shares) of the
outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock if it redeemed its common units of partnership interest of the Partnership for the Company’s
Common Stock, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting
as active bookrunner on an offering of Public Storage’s debt securities in November 2021, joint bookrunning manager on an offering of Public Storage’s
debt securities in April 2021, and active bookrunner on an offering of Public Storage’s debt securities in January 2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its
affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company, Blackstone, and Public Storage. During the
two-year period preceding delivery of its written opinion ending on April 24, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan (i) from Parent and its
affiliates and their portfolio companies were approximately $242 million and (ii) from Public Storage were approximately $7 million. During the two-year
period preceding delivery of its written opinion ending on April 24, 2022, J.P. Morgan did not recognize any fees from the Company. In the ordinary
course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,
bank loans or other obligations) of the Company, Blackstone or Public Storage for their own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly,
they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments. The information regarding fees recognized by J.P.
Morgan disclosed in this paragraph is based upon information provided to us by J.P. Morgan.
Financing
In connection with the closing of the Mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $6.6 billion to be paid to the holders of our Common
Stock, including the holders of Company equity awards, and the holders
-56-
Table of Contents
of common units of partnership interest of the Partnership. In addition, Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the Mergers, Parent
expects to cause our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any, to be prepaid in full. As of May 19, 2022, we had $0 in aggregate
principal amount of consolidated indebtedness under our revolving credit facility.
Parent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the Mergers, a debt commitment letter from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Bank of
America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Societe Generale Financial Corporation, providing
for debt financing through a CMBS loan and balance sheet loan in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $4.85 billion to be funded on or after the
closing of the Mergers, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in the debt commitment letter (which we refer to collectively as the “debt
financing”) and that it may seek to obtain additional debt financing in connection with the Mergers. In addition, it is expected that the Sponsor and its
affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by
such debt financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing
may be used for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements, and for other
costs and expenses related to the financing and the Mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the
debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us,
certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral,
and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The Merger Agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. For more information,
see “The Merger Agreement — Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Mergers.”
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger
In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Company Merger, holders of our
Common Stock should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Company Merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of holders of our Common Stock generally. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other
matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Company Merger), and in recommending that the common stockholders vote in favor
of the proposal to approve the Company Merger. These interests are described below. The Company Merger will be a “change in control” (or term of
similar import) for purposes of our executive compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.
Our executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Stephen W. Wilson (President and Chief
Executive Officer), Adeel Khan (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and Trenton A. Groves (Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting
Officer). Our executive officer who is not a named executive officer for purposes of the discussion below is Maria R. Hawthorne (Interim Chief Operating
Officer).
The information in this section and the tables below do not include information for Dan M. Chandler, III, our former President and Chief Executive
Officer, John W. Petersen, our former Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, or Jeffrey D. Hedges, our former Executive
Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, because while they are technically “named executive officers” pursuant to SEC rules, they are no
longer executive officers of the Company and will not receive any compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Company Merger.

Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of our common stock is $187.50, which is the per share merger consideration;
•
The Company Merger Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the Company
Merger Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each of our executive officers was terminated by us without “cause” (as such term is defined in the relevant plans and
agreements), in either case immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time and on the assumed date of the Company Merger
Effective Time of May 18, 2022.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date,
including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the Company Merger Effective Time.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity-Based Awards
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, our outstanding
equity-based awards, including awards held by our executive officers and directors, will be treated as follows:
•
Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a cash
payment in an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time multiplied by (2) the excess (if any) of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price applicable to the
Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each Company Option with a per share exercise price that exceeds the merger
consideration will be cancelled for no consideration.
•
Each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a
cash payment in an amount equal to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each Company Deferred Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will become vested
and, at the Company Merger Effective Time, be converted into a right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to (1) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to the Company Deferred Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
multiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each 2022 EIP Award will be cancelled in exchange for a specified cash payment, less any applicable withholding taxes.
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Company Merger” for an estimate of the value of each of our named executive officer’s unvested equity-based awards. In addition to the awards
that are outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement, the Company will also grant a 2022 EIP Award with a value of $3.4 million to Mr. Wilson in
recognition of his transition from interim to permanent Chief Executive Officer after the date that 2022 EIP Awards were granted to other executives of the
Company. Based on the assumptions described above under “—Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at
the Company Merger Effective Time to Ms. Hawthorne in respect of her unvested equity awards are as follows: unvested
-58-
Table of Contents
Company Options — $48,902; and unvested Company RSU Awards — $937,500. The estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the
Company Merger Effective Time to our nonemployee directors in respect of their unvested equity awards are as follows: unvested Company Options —
$2,003,055; and unvested Company Deferred Stock Unit Awards — $7,125,000.
2022 Annual Awards to Directors
Following the 2022 annual meeting of our stockholders on April 29, 2022, we granted to each of our directors, in lieu of the annual grant of
Company Options that we would typically make, a cash long-term incentive award in the amount of $31,000 (which corresponds to the approximate Black-
Scholes value of the 2021 annual grant of Company Options to our directors). Each cash long-term incentive award will vest ratably over five years
(consistent with the vesting schedule applicable to annual grants of Company Options) subject to the director’s continued service on our board of
directors, and will accelerate and vest in full at the Company Merger Effective Time.
Severance Letter Agreements with Certain Executive Officers
Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company will enter into a letter agreement with each of Ms. Hawthorne and Messrs. Khan and
Groves providing for the payment of (i) a lump sum cash severance amount equal to $2,200,000, $1,100,000, and $460,000, respectively and (ii) a lump sum
cash payment equal to three months of COBRA premiums, the estimated value of which is $4,107, $8,482, and $4,741, respectively. Each letter agreement
will provide that the applicable executive officer’s employment will be terminated without cause effective as of the closing date (or, if requested by Parent,
as of a date that is not later than 30 days after the closing date) and that the severance payments are subject to such executive officer signing and not
revoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates.
Transaction Success Bonus Program
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may adopt a transaction success bonus program in an aggregate amount of up to $2.5 million to
promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the completion of the Company Merger. Awards under the transaction success bonus
program will be allocated among employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than Messrs. Wilson and Khan, who are excluded from
participation) who are selected by our Chief Executive Officer (or his designees). Each transaction success bonus award will vest in full at the Company
Merger Effective Time, subject to the participant’s continued employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries through the Company Merger
Effective Time. As of the date of this proxy statement, no transaction success bonus awards have been granted to any of our executive officers.
2022 Short-Term Cash Incentive Payments
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may pay to each of our employees who is eligible to receive a short-term cash incentive payment in
respect of 2022 (we refer to each as a “2022 Cash Incentive”), including each of our executive officers other than Mr. Wilson and Ms. Hawthorne, a cash
payment that does not exceed the product of (a) such employee’s total target 2022 Cash Incentive, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days elapsed between January 1, 2022 and the closing date and the denominator of which is 365.
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Company Merger” for the estimated maximum amount of the 2022 Cash Incentive payment that may be paid to each of our eligible named
executive officers under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents
Gross-Up Agreements
As previously disclosed, on April 24, 2022, our board of directors approved excise tax gross-up agreements with each of Messrs. Wilson and Khan.
The agreements provide each executive officer with the right to receive a gross-up payment in the event that any payments or benefits provided to such
executive officer in connection with the Company Merger becomes subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
gross-up payment would generally place each executive officer in the same after-tax position that he would have been in if the excise tax did not apply to
him, and does not cover ordinary income taxes due on the payments and benefits giving rise to the excise tax. These gross-up rights are provided solely
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and therefore the gross-up agreements will be automatically revoked if the
Merger Agreement is terminated without the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Company Merger” for the estimated amounts of the payments that each of Messrs. Wilson and Khan would receive under the terms of the
gross-up agreements.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, our non-employee directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the Company Merger.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Company Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of
information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of the Company that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Company Merger.
For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “—Interests of Our
Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the
relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may
occur before the Company Merger Effective Time. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of our common stock is $187.50, which is the per share merger consideration;
•
The Company Merger Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the Company
Merger Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each of our named executive officers was terminated by the surviving corporation without “cause” immediately
following the Company Merger Effective Time and on the assumed date of the Company Merger Effective Time of May 18, 2022.

severance payments pursuant to their severance letter agreements and (ii) a 2022 Cash Incentive payment under the terms of the Merger Agreement
(calculated based on the target level of performance and proration based on the days elapsed prior to the assumed Company Merger Effective

“Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger — 2022 Annual Awards to Directors” and “Interests of our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Company Merger — 2022 Short-Term Cash Incentive Payments”). The cash severance payments to Messrs. Khan and

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend and
Additional Dividends, if any, and the per share merger consideration pursuant to the Company Merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each, as
defined below) of shares of Common Stock. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, proposed, temporary and final U.S. Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”),
each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such
change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given
that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. We have not sought
and will not seek an advance ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this section. This summary assumes that the payment of the Closing
Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, and the Company Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as further
described in this proxy statement.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and is not a complete description of all of the tax consequences of the Closing Cash
Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, and the receipt of cash in the Company Merger to holders of shares of Common Stock, and, in particular, does
not address any tax reporting requirements, tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative
guidance thereunder and the intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and any laws, regulations or
practices adopted in connection therewith) nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or non-U.S. laws or U.S. federal laws other than
those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax, such as gift or estate tax laws.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock who or that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:
•
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized (or treated
as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

Treatment of the Receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company intends to treat the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any,
as dividend distributions to holders of shares of Common Stock to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits.
Additionally, the Company intends to designate the Closing Cash Dividend, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, as a “capital gains
dividend” under Section 857(b) of the Code. The rest of this discussion proceeds on the basis that our intended U.S. federal income tax treatment of the
distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends is respected. Holders of shares of Common Stock are urged to consult their own tax
advisors regarding the impact to them of potential alternative treatments in their particular circumstances. Non-U.S. holders of Common Stock may wish
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the impact of the receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, and the per share
merger consideration pursuant to the Company Merger as opposed to a sale of their Common Stock prior to the Company Merger.
U.S. Holders
Ordinary Dividend. The distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, made by the Company out of its current or
accumulated earnings and profits, and not designated as capital gain dividends, will constitute dividends taxable to U.S. holders as ordinary income.
Noncorporate U.S. holders will generally not be entitled to the preferential tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income except with respect to the
portion of any distribution (1) that represents income from dividends the Company received from a corporation in which the Company owns shares (but
only if such dividends would be eligible for the lower rate on dividends if paid by the corporation to its individual stockholders), (2) that is equal to the
sum of the Company’s REIT taxable income (taking into account the dividends paid deduction available to the Company) and certain net built-in gain with
respect to property acquired from a C corporation in certain transactions in which the Company must adopt the basis of the asset in the hands of the C
corporation for the Company’s previous taxable year, less any taxes paid by the Company during its previous taxable year, or (3) that represents earnings
and profits that were accumulated in a non-REIT taxable year, in each case, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied at
both the Company and the individual stockholder levels. However, to the extent not so treated as qualified dividend income and not designated as a
capital gain dividend, the distribution will generally constitute a dividend with respect to which noncorporate U.S. holders will be permitted to take a
deduction equal to 20% of such dividend for purposes of determining their U.S. federal income tax. Noncorporate U.S. holders should consult their own
tax advisors to determine the tax rates on dividends received from the Company.

Table of Contents
The distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, made by the Company will not be eligible for the dividends
received deduction in the case of U.S. holders that are corporations.
Capital Gain Dividend. The distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends made by the Company, to the extent that the
Company properly designates such distribution as a capital gain dividend, will be taxable to U.S. holders as gain from the sale of a capital asset held for
more than one year, provided that the amount of the dividend so designated does not exceed the Company’s actual net capital gain for the applicable
taxable year, without regard to the period for which a U.S. holder has held the shares of Common Stock. Thus, with certain limitations, a capital gain
dividend received by an individual U.S. holder may be eligible for preferential rates of taxation. U.S. holders that are corporations may, however, be
required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.
Return of Capital. Although the Closing Cash Dividend and any Additional Dividends are expected to be treated as distributions out of the
Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that events occurring after the closing of the Merger could reduce the Company’s
current earnings and profits. To the extent that the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends are in excess of the Company’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits, such a distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to each U.S. holder. Thus, such a distribution will
reduce the adjusted basis that the U.S. holder has in the shares of Common Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes by the amount of the distribution,
but not below zero. This reduction will increase gain (or reduce loss) a U.S. holder would otherwise recognize in respect of the Company Merger (see
“Consequences of the Company Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock”). The distribution made in excess of a U.S. holder’s adjusted basis
in the shares of Common Stock will be taxable as capital gain, provided that the shares of Common Stock have been held as a capital asset.
The distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, made by the Company will not be treated as passive activity
income. As a result, U.S. holders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against that income or gain. A U.S. holder generally may elect to
treat capital gain dividends and income designated as qualified dividend income as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest
limitation, but in such case, the U.S. holder will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amount. Other distributions of the Closing Cash Dividend and
Additional Dividends, to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital, generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing
the investment interest limitation.
Non-U.S. Holders
Ordinary Dividend. The distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, other than the portion of the distribution
designated by the Company as a capital gain dividend, will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distribution is made out of the
Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits. A withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution will ordinarily apply to a
distribution of this kind to non-U.S. holders, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that withholding tax. However, if income from the investment in the
shares of Common Stock is treated as effectively connected with a non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty as a condition for subjecting a non-U.S. holder to U.S. taxation on a net income basis, is attributable to a permanent establishment or
fixed base that the non-U.S. holder maintains in the United States, then the same treatment that applies to U.S. holders with respect to dividends will
generally apply to such non-U.S. holder, and a 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) may also
apply if such non-U.S. holder is a corporation. The Company expects that it or the applicable withholding agent will withhold U.S. federal income tax at a
rate of 30% on the gross amount of the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, other than the portion of the
distribution that is treated as attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests and a capital gain dividend, paid to a non-U.S.
holder, unless (1) a lower treaty rate applies and the required form evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with the Company or the appropriate
withholding agent or (2) the non-U.S. holder files an
-65-
Table of Contents
IRS Form W-8-ECI or a successor form with the Company or the appropriate withholding agent claiming that the distribution is effectively connected with
the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business and, in either case, other applicable requirements are met.
Capital Gain Dividend. The distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, that is attributable to gain from sales or
exchanges by the Company of U.S. real property interests that is paid with respect to shares of Common Stock held by a non-U.S. holder who does not
own more than 10% of such stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution will generally be treated as an ordinary
dividend and subject to withholding in the manner described above under “Ordinary Dividend”.
Any portion of the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends to a non-U.S. holder that is designated by the Company at
the time of distribution as a capital gain dividend that is not attributable to or treated as attributable to the disposition by the Company of a U.S. real
property interest generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, subject to the exceptions discussed in “Consequences of the Company
Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock.”
Return of Capital. Although the Closing Cash Dividend and any Additional Dividends are expected to be treated as distributions out of the
Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that events occurring after the closing of the Merger could reduce the Company’s
current earnings and profits. The Closing Cash Dividend and Additional Dividends, if any, made in excess of the Company’s current and accumulated
earnings and profits will not be taxable to a non-U.S. holder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the non-U.S. holder’s adjusted basis in
such non-U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock. A distribution of this kind will instead reduce the adjusted basis of such non-U.S. holder’s shares of
Common Stock. To the extent that a distribution of this kind exceeds the non-U.S. holder’s adjusted basis in such non-U.S. holder’s shares of Common
Stock, the distribution will give rise to tax liability if the non-U.S. holder otherwise would have to pay tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of such
non-U.S. holder’s shares. See the discussion below under “Consequences of the Company Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock.” If it
cannot be determined at the time the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend or Additional Dividend is made whether such distribution will be in excess
of current and accumulated earnings and profits, withholding will generally apply to the distribution at the rate applicable to ordinary dividends.
However, a non-U.S. holder may seek a refund of these amounts from the IRS if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess
of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided that certain conditions are met.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties will treat the Company Merger as a taxable sale of Common Stock in exchange for the cash

the Company Merger will be treated as described above.",73,73

The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger is expected to be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of Common Stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received in exchange for such U.S. holder’s shares of
Common Stock in the Company Merger and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Common Stock.
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of Common Stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of Common Stock. Any such gain or loss will generally
be capital gain or loss and will be
-66-Table of Contents
long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Common Stock surrendered in the Company Merger is greater than one
year at the time of the Company Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S.
federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
A U.S. holder who has held shares of Common Stock for less than six months at the time of the Company Merger, taking into account the holding
period rules of Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such shares of Common Stock in the Company
Merger will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder’s share of any
designated retained capital gains, with respect to such shares.

A non-U.S. holder’s gain or loss from the Company Merger will generally be determined in the same manner as that of a U.S. holder. Subject to the
discussion of backup withholding below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,” a non-U.S. holder generally should not be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the gain or loss from the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company
Merger, except as described below.
Gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder upon a sale or exchange of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger generally will not be
taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (“FIRPTA”) if the Company is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity,”
defined generally to include a REIT, provided that less than 50% in value of the stock of such REIT is and was held directly or indirectly by foreign
persons at all times during a specified testing period (provided that, if any class of a REIT’s stock is regularly traded on an established securities market
in the United States, a person holding less than 5% of such class at all times during the testing period is generally presumed not to be a foreign person,
unless the REIT has actual knowledge otherwise). The Company believes that it is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” and, therefore,
assuming that the Company is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the Effective Time, taxation under FIRPTA will not apply to the
receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
If the Company does not qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity,” the tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of an
exchange of shares of Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Company Merger will depend upon whether such stock is regularly traded on an
established securities market in the United States and the amount of such stock that is held by a non-U.S. holder. The Company believes that its shares of
Common Stock are regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States within the meaning of FIRPTA and the applicable Treasury
Regulations. Therefore, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax under FIRPTA, unless such non-U.S. holder has held
more than 10% of the value of the shares of the Common Stock at any time during the applicable testing period. Non-U.S. holders should consult their
own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences of the Company Merger to them, including the applicability of FIRPTA. In particular, a non-
U.S. holder who has held more than 10% of the shares of Common Stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the Company
Merger or a non-U.S. holder who is a “qualified shareholder” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) is urged to consult its tax advisors
concerning the tax consequences to them of the receipt of the merger consideration.
However, even if not subject to FIRPTA, gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder as a result of the Company Merger will be taxable to such non-U.S.
holder if such gain is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. trade or business and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty
as a condition for subjecting the non-U.S. holder to U.S. taxation on a net income basis, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that the
non-U.S. holder maintains in the United States. In this case, the same treatment that applies to U.S. holders with respect to the gain will generally apply to
such non-U.S. holder, and a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified
by an applicable income tax treaty) on such gain. In addition, any such gain will be taxable to a non-U.S. holder if the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident
alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more
-67-Table of Contents
during the taxable year or maintains an office or a fixed place of business in the United States to which the gain is attributable. In such cases, a 30% tax
(or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) will apply to the nonresident alien individual’s capital gains, which may be
offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided
the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of their particular facts and
circumstances and the procedures for claiming tax treaty benefits or otherwise establishing an exemption from U.S. withholding tax.",74,75

Information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to payments of cash made in connection with the
Company Merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder of shares of Common Stock who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding on a duly executed IRS Form W-9, and
otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; (2) in the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes a duly executed
applicable IRS Form W-8; or (3) provides proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules
and certification requirements. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be claimed as
a refund or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, so long as such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a
timely manner.

As of June 8, 2022, three lawsuits have been filed by purported stockholders of the Company in connection with the Mergers. On May 26, 2022, a
purported stockholder of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and the current members of the Company’s board of directors alleging that
the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company in connection with the Mergers contained alleged material misstatements and/or omissions in
violation of federal law. The lawsuit is captioned Shiva Stein v. PS Business Parks, Inc., et al., Case 1:21-cv-04330 and is pending in the United States

allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the

Common Stock
At the Company Merger Effective Time, each share of our Common Stock (other than the cancelled shares) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be automatically
-71-Table of Contents
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. If we declare an Additional Dividend, which is a dividend determined by us to be reasonably
necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the imposition of income or excise tax or any other entity-level tax as permitted
under the Merger Agreement, the merger consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such Additional Dividend.
Additionally, immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, we will be required to pay the Closing Cash Dividend to holders of record of our
Common Stock as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date in an amount reasonably determined by the
Company in consultation with Parent equal to or in excess of the sum of (i) the amount required to be distributed to avoid the imposition of income or
excise tax or any other entity-level tax for the Company’s hypothetical short taxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers or the
Company’s taxable year ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) the estimated accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, calculated pursuant to
applicable Treasury Regulations, for the Company’s hypothetical short taxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers, so long as any
such Closing Cash Dividend is no greater than the cash available for distribution. The Closing Cash Dividend will also reduce the merger consideration
per share by an amount equal to the per share amount of such Closing Cash Dividend.
Preferred Stock
Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and each depositary share issued
pursuant to the deposit agreements for the Preferred Stock, representing one-thousandth of one share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be unaffected by the Company Merger and will remain outstanding in accordance with their
respective terms.
Company Options
Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in an amount equal to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company
Option immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by (2) the excess (if any) of the merger consideration over the per share
exercise price applicable to the Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each Company Option with a per share exercise price that exceeds
the merger consideration will be cancelled for no consideration.
Company RSU Awards
Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in an amount equal to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Company DSU Awards
Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each Company Deferred Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time will become vested and, at the Company Merger Effective Time, be converted into a right to receive a cash payment in an

Partnership Units
At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each partnership unit (other than units held by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their
respective wholly owned subsidiaries) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration.
Company Partnership Interests
At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each partnership unit owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time will remain outstanding as a partnership unit of the Surviving Partnership held by the Company or the relevant
subsidiary. Following the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company will be the general partner of the Surviving Partnership and will have
such rights, duties and obligations as are more fully set forth in the partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership, as amended in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement.
No Further Ownership Rights
At the Company Merger Effective Time and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, holders of our Common Stock and the holders of
partnership units of the Partnership, respectively, that have their shares or units converted into the right to receive the merger consideration will cease to
be, and will have no rights as, our stockholders or limited partners of the Partnership other than the right to receive the merger consideration. The merger
consideration paid, delivered or issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates representing Common Stock or partnership units will be deemed to
have been paid, delivered or issued, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Common Stock or partnership
units exchanged therefor.
Exchange and Payment Procedures
At or before the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a paying agent reasonably satisfactory to us,
for the benefit of the holders of our Common Stock and the partnership units, the merger consideration, less the merger consideration to be paid in
respect of our equity awards as described in “—Treatment of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Equity Awards” above (which amounts will be paid or
delivered directly to the Surviving Company). As soon as practicable after the closing date (but in any event within five business days), the paying agent
will mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, represented outstanding
shares of Common Stock or that, immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, represented partnership units, a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the merger consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. The letter
of transmittal and instructions will tell you how to surrender your certificates representing shares of Common Stock or partnership units, as applicable, in
exchange for the merger consideration.
Holders of book-entry shares of Common Stock or book-entry partnership units will not receive a letter of transmittal for their shares of Common
Stock or partnership units from the paying agent. Instead, holders of such book-entry shares of Common Stock or book-entry partnership units will
automatically be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled.

Upon surrender of a certificate that previously represented shares of Common Stock or partnership units to the paying agent, together with a letter
of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
paying agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive the merger consideration payable in respect of the shares of our Common Stock or
partnership units, as applicable, previously represented by such certificate. The merger consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in
whose name the certificate so surrendered is registered in our and the Partnership’s transfer records, if any such certificate is properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment pays any transfer or other similar taxes or establishes to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any certificate. The Company, the Surviving Company, the
Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the paying agent (and any affiliates or designees of the foregoing) and any
other applicable withholding agent, as applicable, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger
Agreement to any person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to our
equity awards, the vesting and/or cancellation of such equity awards) under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental entity,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
On the closing date, the share transfer books of the Company and the unit transfer books of the Partnership will be closed and thereafter there will
be no further registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock or partnership units.
None of Parent, Merger Sub I, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Partnership, the Company or the paying agent,
or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or affiliate thereof, will be liable to any person in respect of merger consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
Any portion of the merger consideration which remains undistributed to the holders of the certificates or the holders of any shares of Common
Stock or partnership units held in book-entry for 12 months after the closing date will be delivered to the Surviving Company, and any holders of our
Common Stock or partnership units prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, who have not
theretofore complied with the exchange and payment procedures contained in the Merger Agreement must look only to the Surviving Company and only
as general creditors thereof for payment of the merger consideration.
If any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the paying agent and the taking of such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by the paying agent, the paying agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the merger consideration, pursuant to the

required to (1) through our board of directors, recommend to holders of our Common Stock that they vote in favor of the Company Merger so that we

adverse recommendation change, as permitted by and determined in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Company Acquisition
Proposals; Non-Solicitation” and “—Obligation of the Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation.” Unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, we are prohibited from submitting to the vote of our common stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement a “Company Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal from any person or “group” (as

•
any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, we may adjourn or postpone the special meeting, after consultation
with Parent: (a) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to our common
stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of a vote on the Company Merger; if additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies
in favor of the approval of the Company Merger; or (c) if there are insufficient shares of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the special meeting, provided that, in the case of clause (b) or clause (c), without the written
consent of Parent, in no event will the special meeting (as so postponed or adjourned) be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which
the special meeting was originally scheduled.
Under the Merger Agreement, we must call, give notice of, convene and hold the special meeting and mail this proxy statement to our stockholders

modifications to the financial and other material terms thereof (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the business or operations of the person making such Company Acquisition Proposal) and (B) a written summary of the
material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal not made in writing (including any material terms and conditions
proposed orally or supplementally and any modifications to the financial and other material terms thereof).
Promptly after the No-Shop Period Start Date (and, in any event, within 24 hours thereafter), we are required to:
•
request each person (other than Parent, its affiliates and their respective representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with any inquiry, Company Acquisition Proposal or its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal to promptly return
or destroy all non-public information furnished to such person by or on behalf of us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date; and
•
terminate any data room or other diligence access to each such person (and its representatives); provided, that we will not be required to

Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal), if in the good faith determination of our board of directors, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, we or our subsidiaries may:
•
furnish non-public information to such third party (and such third party’s representatives, including potential financing sources), provided
however, that prior to furnishing such information, we receive from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement (which we refer to as an
“acceptable confidentiality agreement”) on customary terms no more favorable in any material respect to such persons than our existing
confidentiality agreement with Blackstone, it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar
provisions that would prohibit the making or amendment of any non-public Company Acquisition Proposal to our board of directors, and any non-
public information concerning us or our subsidiaries that is provided to such third party (or its representatives) shall, to the extent not previously
provided to Parent, be provided to Parent as promptly as practicable after providing it to such third party (and in any event within 48 hours
thereafter); and
•
engage in, enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party (and such third party’s representatives)
with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal.
From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, we will notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours) after receipt of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information regarding us or any of our subsidiaries by any third party that informs us that it is
considering making, or has made, a

Company Acquisition Proposal, or any other inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with us regarding a possible Company
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice will be made in writing and shall identify the person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and
indicate the material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposals or inquiries, to the extent known (including, if applicable, providing
copies of any written Company Acquisition Proposals or inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto, which may be redacted to the extent
necessary to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the person making such Company Acquisition Proposals or inquiry). We
will also promptly, and in any event within 48 hours, notify Parent in writing if we enter into discussions or negotiations concerning any Company
Acquisition Proposal or provide nonpublic information to any person, notify Parent of any change to the financial and other material terms and
conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any Company Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry on a reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all written proposals, offers, drafts of proposed agreements or
correspondence relating thereto (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the
person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry). Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may, after the date of the Merger Agreement, enter
into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit us from providing such information to Parent.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement a “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written Company Acquisition Proposal (provided that the
references to “15%” in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal will be replaced with references to “50%”) by a third party which our board of
directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors, to be (A) if consummated, more
favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (B) reasonably
likely to be consummated, taking into account (x) the financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of such proposal, (y) the likelihood and timing of
consummation (as compared to the Company Merger) and (z) any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent and any other

Except in the circumstances and pursuant to the procedures described below, neither our board of directors nor any committee thereof will:
•
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent), our board of directors’ recommendation with respect to the Company Merger;

than an acceptable confidentiality agreement).
We refer to any action described in the first three bullet points above as an “adverse recommendation change.”
Prior to the approval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by our common stockholders, our
board of directors may effect an adverse recommendation change
-89-Table of Contents
and/or (only in the case of a Superior Proposal) terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a
Superior Proposal:
•
if an Intervening Event (as defined below) has occurred and our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with our board’s duties under applicable
law, or if our board has received after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the cut-off time from an excluded party a Company
Acquisition Proposal or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, an unsolicited written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal (and we have
not breached certain of the provisions described above under “—Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation” and under “—Obligation of the
Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”, subject to certain materiality qualifiers set forth in the Merger Agreement) that, in
the good faith determination of our board of directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, after having complied (other than any non-compliance with certain provisions that has a de minimis effect) with, and
giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent, and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn;
•
if we provide prior written notice to Parent of our intention to effect an adverse recommendation change and/or terminate the Merger
Agreement, as applicable (which we refer to as a “notice of change of recommendation”), identifying the person making the Superior
Proposal and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that is the basis for
effecting an adverse recommendation change and/or terminating the Merger Agreement, as applicable, including, if applicable, copies of
any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to a Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery of
such notice will not constitute an adverse recommendation change);
•
if we negotiate with Parent in good faith for a period of three business days following Parent’s receipt of the notice of change of
recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such 3rd business day (which we refer to as a “notice of change period”)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or in the case of an Intervening Event, in order to obviate the need to make such adverse
recommendation change; and
•
if our board of directors, following the end of the notice of change period, has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the
notice of change of recommendation or otherwise, that (1) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the notice of change of recommendation
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (2) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the board to effect an adverse
recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with our directors’ duties under applicable law.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Intervening Event” means a material event, development or change in circumstances with respect to us
and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that occurred or arose after the date of the Merger Agreement, which was unknown to, nor reasonably foreseeable
by, our board of directors as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, and first becomes known to or by our board of directors prior to the
approval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by our common stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event:
•
the receipt, existence of or terms of an inquiry or a Company Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof;
and
•
changes in the market price or trading volume of our Common Stock or the Company Depositary Shares or the fact that we meet or exceed
internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial results for any period, provided,
however, that the
-90-
Table of Contents
underlying causes of such change or fact will not be excluded by the provision described in this bullet point.
Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such a Superior Proposal will require a new notice of change of
recommendation, and we will be required to comply again with the requirements described above, except that the notice of change period will be reduced
to two business days following receipt by Parent of any such new notice of change of recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on
such 2nd business day.
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement will prohibit us or our board of directors from taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to our
stockholders that is required by applicable law or if our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with our directors’ duties under applicable law, provided, however, that
neither we nor our board of directors will be permitted to recommend that our stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or
exchange offer that is a Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise effect an adverse recommendation change with respect thereto, except as permitted
by the provisions described above.

From and after the Company Merger Effective Time and for a period ending on the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if
shorter, during any applicable period of employment), each of our and our subsidiaries’ employees who is employed immediately prior to, and continues
employment with the Surviving Company or any of its subsidiaries following, the Company Merger Effective Time, each of which we refer to as a
“Company Employee,” will be entitled to receive (1) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate in
effect with respect to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (2) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no
less favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
and (3) other compensation and benefits (including severance benefits, paid time off, health insurance and equity-based compensation opportunities
under the Equity Incentive Plan Awards Program and the Leader Board Program but excluding all other equity-based compensation and long-term
incentive compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, it being understood that cash compensation in an amount equal to the target annual
equity-based compensation opportunity applicable to such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time may be
provided in lieu of equity-based compensation.
For the employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries providing any benefits to any Company Employee after the Company Merger
Effective Time, each Company Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with us and our subsidiaries and our and their respective
predecessors as if such service were with Parent or an applicable subsidiary, provided that the foregoing will not apply (1) for purposes of accrual of or
entitlement to pension benefits, post-employment welfare benefits, special or early retirement programs, window separation programs or similar plans
which may be in effect from time to time, (2) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or (3) to the extent the we did not
recognize such service under any comparable plan, program or benefit. After the Company Merger Effective Time, each Company Employee will continue
to be credited with the unused paid time off credited to such employee through the Company Merger Effective Time under our or our subsidiaries’
applicable paid time off policies (subject to the same forfeiture conditions and accrual limits as applicable prior to the Company Merger Effective Time).
All limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods or any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation of Company Employees under Parent’s or

requirements, waiting periods or other restrictions that are already in effect with respect to such Company Employees and that have not been satisfied as
of the closing date of the Company Merger under any Company employee benefit plan. Any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to
such Company Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Company Employees under the comparable
company benefit plans immediately prior to the closing of the Company Merger will be waived by Parent and its subsidiaries. Additionally, each Company
Employee and his or her dependents will be provided with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the closing date for the plan
year within which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs in order to satisfy any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and for any
lifetime maximums, under any welfare plans that such Company Employees are eligible to participate in after the closing date of the Company Merger.
On and after the closing date of the Company Merger, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to honor all

In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Sponsor entered into a guaranty in our favor to guarantee Parent’s payment obligations with respect
to the Parent termination fee and certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under the Merger Agreement, subject to the
terms and limitations set forth in the guaranty.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Sponsor under the guaranty will not exceed $735 million plus all reasonable and documented third-party

us to enforce our rights under the guaranty, if we prevail in such litigation or proceeding.

limited exceptions, including with respect to enforcing confidentiality provisions and certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of
Parent, our sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II relating to any breach of the Merger Agreement or otherwise will be
the right to receive the Parent termination fee under the conditions described under “—Termination Fees — Termination Fee Payable by Parent.” Parent,

The following summarizes the material provisions of the Support Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain
all of the information about the Support Agreement that is important to you. The summary of the material terms of the Support Agreement below and
elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Support Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement
as Exhibit B and which we incorporate by reference into this proxy statement. We recommend that you read the Support Agreement attached to this
proxy statement as Exhibit B carefully and in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Support
Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Company entered into a Support Agreement with Public Storage, who as
of the record date owned 7,158,354 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, or approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
Common Stock, as well as 7,305,355 common units of partnership interest of the Partnership. As of the record date, Public Storage was the only limited
partner of the Partnership other than the Company.
Pursuant to the Support Agreement, Public Storage has agreed, among other things, that at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company or
partners of the Partnership, and in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company or partners of the Partnership, it will (a)
appear at such meeting or otherwise cause any Covered Securities to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum, (b) vote or
cause to be voted all of the Covered Securities in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and approving the Mergers and the transactions contemplated
thereby and (c) vote or cause to be voted all of the Covered Securities against any alternative acquisition proposal or any other action that could
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, materially delay, materially postpone or adversely affect the Mergers or other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement or result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the
Company or the Partnership under the Merger Agreement or of Public Storage under the Support Agreement. Public Storage also agreed not to transfer
any Covered Securities during the term of the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement does not require Public Storage to redeem any common units
of partnership interest of the Partnership beneficially owned by Public Storage for shares of Common Stock.
The Support Agreement also contains certain commitments by Public Storage and the Surviving Company, effective upon the closing of the
Mergers, relating to the preservation of certain intercompany arrangements between the Surviving Company and Public Storage and access to certain
books and records relating to the Company and its subsidiaries that are in the possession or under the control of Public Storage, as well as other certain
commitments by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company and Public Storage with respect to certain tax matters.
Except with respect to certain provisions which shall survive termination, the Support Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest of (i)
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms or (iii) if there occurs any amendment or
modification to the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount or changes the form of consideration payable in any of the Mergers or otherwise amends
or modifies the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse (directly or indirectly) to Public Storage without Public Storage’s prior written consent.

The table below sets forth, as of June 7, 2022, certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our Common Stock, for (1) each
person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, (2) each of our directors and named
executive officers, and (3) all of our directors and named executive officers as a group. Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment
power with respect to all of the shares of Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise set forth in the notes to the
table.
The SEC has defined “beneficial ownership” of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment power
over such security. A common stockholder is also deemed to be, as of any date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such stockholder has the right
to acquire within 60 days after that date through (1) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (2) the conversion of a security, (3) the power to revoke a
trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement or (4) the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. In computing
the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our Common Stock subject to options,
vesting or other rights (as set forth above) held by that person that are exercisable or will become exercisable or vest within 60 days thereafter, are deemed
outstanding, while such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person.

Stock continuously for at least three years, may include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors or 20% of

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as banks and brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to
those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost
savings for companies.
A number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be “householding” our proxy materials. A single proxy statement will be
delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the impacted stockholders. Once you have
received notice from your broker that it will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are notified
otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate
proxy statement and annual report, please notify us, by calling (818) 244-8080 or by directing your written request to: PS Business Parks, Inc., 701
Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201, Attention: Adeel Khan, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary. Pursuant
to such request, the Company will undertake to promptly deliver a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, to you.

communications should contact their brokers as specified above.

assist or knowingly encourage, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in, any class action with respect to any action or claim, derivative

partner of the Partnership in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.

consideration, the Stockholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary and
reasonably requested to effect the actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

shares, units or the like between the date of this Agreement and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the terms “Owned Shares”, “Owned Units” and
“Covered Securities” shall be deemed to refer to and include such shares or partnership interests as well as all such stock dividends and unit
distributions and any securities into which or for which any or all of such shares or partnership interests may be changed or exchanged or which are
received in such transaction.

Purpose”, one (1) year following the Closing and (y) with respect to the matters set forth in clause (C) of the definition of “Proper Purpose”, six (6) years
following the Closing, the Stockholder agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make available, or cause to be provided or made
available, to Parent, during normal business hours, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of reasonable advance written request therefor, any
information (or a copy thereof) to the extent relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in the possession or under the control of the Stockholder or its
controlled affiliates which Parent reasonably requests to the extent that such information is reasonably required for a Proper Purpose; provided, however,
the Stockholder shall not be required to (or to cause any controlled affiliate to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the
Stockholder believes in good faith that doing so would be reasonably likely to: (i) result in a risk of loss or waiver of attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product or other legal privilege; (ii) violate any obligations of the Stockholder with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach,
contravene or violate any Contract to which the Stockholder is party or (iii) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (provided that the

of Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Stockholder be required to create any information or to change the format in which
existing information appears. The Stockholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and keep, or cause to be preserved and kept, all
books and records (including electronically stored data and information) in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession or under the
control of the Stockholder or its controlled affiliates for the periods during which it is required to provide or make available such books and records to
Parent pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8(c).
(d) Parent agrees to reimburse the Stockholder for the reasonable costs and expenses of gathering, copying, transporting and/or otherwise
complying with Section 8(c) and Section 8(e).
(e) On or promptly after the Closing Date, the Stockholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer to the Company copies of all
books and records exclusively relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in the possession or under the control of the Stockholder or its controlled
affiliates (including, so long as exclusively related to the Company or its Subsidiaries, Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any materials
exclusively related to the preparation or support thereof and other books and records exclusively related to Taxes paid or payable by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Stockholder be required to create any information or to change the format in
which existing information appears.
9. REIT Matters.
(a) To the extent the Company qualifies as a REIT at the Closing (without regard to the effect of Closing or post-Closing events that affect
the Company’s pre-Closing REIT qualification), Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, take all actions, and refrain
from taking all actions, as are reasonably necessary to ensure that, after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company will continue to qualify for
taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its taxable year that includes the Closing Date (the “Relevant REIT Year”). The Company shall
timely and properly make the necessary distributions under Section 858(a) of the Code with respect to the Company’s taxable year ended December 31,
2021. In accordance with the Company’s obligation under Section 5.13(a) of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall timely request that the
Company jointly execute an IRS Form 8875 on a protective basis with the Stockholder to be effective no later than March 31, 2022 (to treat the Company
as a TRS of the Stockholder
B-6

(d) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership allocable to the Stockholder for the portion of the Relevant REIT
Year that ends at the Closing shall be allocated based on the “interim closing method” under Code Section 706 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
(e) If an audit is commenced, an adjustment is proposed or any other claim is made by any Governmental Entity with respect to any issue
that is reasonably expected to affect the Company’s REIT qualification for the Relevant REIT Year or any prior taxable years (a “Tax Contest”), then
Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the Stockholder and afford the Stockholder, at the Stockholder’s election, which election shall be made
within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of such Tax Contest, and at the Stockholder’s sole expense, the opportunity to participate in the conduct of

16. Governing Law and Venue; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial.

respect to issues relating to the Partnership Conversion that are required to be governed by the CRULPA), in each case without regard to its rules of
conflict of laws that would result in the application of any laws other than those specified above. Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) irrevocably submits
to and agrees to be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Maryland and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of

indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
hereof, (ii) irrevocably agrees that all such claims, actions, suits or proceedings may and shall be brought before, and determined by, only a Chosen Court
with subject matter jurisdiction over such claim(s), action(s), suit(s) or proceeding(s), (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees that it will not (except for a suit on the judgment as expressly
permitted by the final sentence of this Section 16(a)) bring any claim, action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a Chosen Court. In any judicial proceeding, each of the parties further consents to the
assignment of any proceeding in the Courts of the State of Maryland to the Business and Technology Case Management Program pursuant to Maryland
Rule 16-205 (or any successor thereof). Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other
process in any other claim, suit, action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, in
the manner provided by Section 12 hereof and nothing in this Section 16 hereof shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any claim, suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO

the case may be), in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Parent (in the case of an assignment or
delegation by the Stockholder) and the Stockholder (in the case of an assignment or delegation by Parent), and any attempted or purported assignment or
delegation in violation of this Section 17 shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
18. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including the Stockholder’s obligations to vote its
Covered Securities as provided in this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties hereto
B-10
Table of Contents
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without any requirement for the posting of security, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (a) any party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
19. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.
20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement. The exchange
of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
hereto to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
21. Interpretation and Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or is favoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The words

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Company Common Stock”), of PS Business Parks, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the
Transaction (as defined below). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 24, 2022 (the “Agreement”), by and among the
Company, Sequoia Parent L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Acquiror”), Sequoia Merger Sub I LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, Sequoia
Merger Sub II LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, and PS Business Parks, L.P., a California limited partnership (the “Partnership”), (i) Merger Sub II
will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership being the surviving entity (the “Partnership Merger”), and each outstanding common
partnership unit (each, a “Common Partnership Unit”) of the Partnership, other than the Excluded Units (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted
into the right to receive $187.50 per unit in cash, and (ii) Merger Sub I will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
entity (the “Company Merger” and together with the Partnership Merger, the “Transaction”), and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock,
other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Acquiror or Merger Sub I or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Acquiror or
Merger Sub I will be converted into the right to receive $187.50 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated April 24, 2022 of the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available
business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and
forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business; and (iv) performed such other financial studies and analyses and
considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and
the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other
matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to
or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or
completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of
the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to
which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have
also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement,

(a) Procedure. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving Company shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
represented outstanding Company Shares or that, immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, represented Common Partnership Units,
which were converted into the right to receive or be exchanged for the Per Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.3: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance
with Section 2.6(f) to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree and specify) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Company Share Merger Consideration
or Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.6(f) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the
Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Per Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of
the Company Shares or Common Partnership Units, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares or Common Partnership Units
to a Person that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or Partnership, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal
or surrender such Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units to the Paying Agent. In lieu thereof, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units
shall automatically upon the Company Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Per Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of the
Company Shares or Common Partnership Units, as applicable, previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Unit, in each case, as
contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Per Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as
applicable, as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrue for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or
Book-Entry Units on any cash payable hereunder.
(b) No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Shares or Common Partnership Units. On the Closing Date, holders of Company Shares or
Common Partnership Units that are converted into the right to receive Per Company Share Merger Consideration or Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration, as applicable, shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company or limited partners of the Partnership other than
the right to receive the Per Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, as provided under this
Article II. The Per Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, paid or delivered or issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Shares or Common Partnership Units, or automatically in the case of Book-Entry
Shares or Book-Entry Units, in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
A-8Table of Contents
to have been paid, delivered or issued, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Shares or Common
Partnership Units, as applicable, exchanged therefor.
(c) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates, Book-
Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company and any holders of Company
Shares or Common Partnership Units prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Per
Company Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, upon compliance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.6(a) and subject to Section 2.6(d).
(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub I, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Partnership, the
Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.
(e) Investment of Exchange Fund. After the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by the Surviving Company. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company. Until the
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.6(c), to the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of
the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Company Share Merger Consideration or the
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Company shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make all such
payments.
(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent and the taking of such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to,
and subject to Section 2.6(c), the Surviving Company) will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Company Share
Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect thereof, in accordance with this Agreement.

Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take any and all actions to avoid the entry of, and resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate or remove any actual, anticipated or threatened temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or
judgment entered or issued, or that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind, in each case that
would reasonably be expected to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make unlawful the consummation of the Mergers, including
becoming subject to, consenting to, or offering or agreeing to, or otherwise taking any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
contract or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise

Surviving Company, the Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner or (iii) impose any restriction,
requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, the
Surviving Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that none of the Company, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, the
Surviving Partnership, Parent or any of their respective affiliates shall be required to take any of the actions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) unless the
effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the Closing; provided, further, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Section 5.5 or any other provision of this Agreement shall require any of Parent or its affiliates to agree or otherwise be required to, take
any action, including any action contemplated in clauses (i) through (iii) above with respect to Parent or any of its affiliates (including Blackstone Inc.
(“Blackstone”) and any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by, Blackstone or any portfolio company (as such
term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or investment of Blackstone or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle), or any
interest therein, other than with respect to the Company. In no event shall the Company, the Partnership or any of their respective controlled affiliates
propose to any Governmental Entity, negotiate, effect or agree to any action contemplated by clauses (i) - (iii) above without the prior written consent of
Parent.
(d) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Partnership Merger Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall not, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, take or agree to
take any action, including acquiring or agreeing to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in or otherwise making any investment in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquiring or agreeing to acquire or
make any investment in any assets, or agreeing to any commercial or strategic relationship with any Person, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger, consolidation, investment or commercial or strategic relationship would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization,
declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.
(e) Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably informed regarding any Transaction Litigation unless doing so would, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries with respect thereto. The Company shall
promptly advise Parent in writing of the initiation of and any material developments regarding, and shall reasonably consult with and permit Parent and its
Representatives to participate in the defense, negotiations or settlement of, any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall give consideration to
Parent’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiaries nor any of its or their
Representatives to, compromise or settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).
(f) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to Parent,
Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action
necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement,
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

of, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any Person (and its Representatives, including potential financing sources) pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Company shall provide to Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II any non-public information or data that

concurrently with the time it is provided to such person (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter) and (ii) engage in any discussions or

No-Shop Period Start Date, (y) provide Parent a list identifying each Excluded Party as of the No-Shop Period Start Date and (z) provide to Parent (A) a
copy of any Company Acquisition Proposal made in writing and any other written terms or proposals provided (including financing commitments) to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal and any modifications to the financial and other
material terms thereof (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal) and (B) a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal not

each Person (other than Parent, its affiliates and their respective Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with any
Inquiry, Company Acquisition Proposal or its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy all non-public

terminate any data room or other diligence access to each such Person (and its Representatives); provided, that the Company shall not be required to
take any such action in respect of any Excluded Party unless and until such Person or group ceases to be an Excluded Party (in which case all references
in this sentence to the No-Shop Period Start Date shall be read as the date on which such Person or group ceases to be an Excluded Party).
(b) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by this
Section 5.6, from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries, and its and
their officers and directors to, and shall direct its and their other Representatives to, and shall cause Public Storage and its officers and directors to, and
shall cause Public Storage to direct its other Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or communications with
any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such
Person or group is an
A-43Table of Contents
Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by this Section 5.6, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other
Representatives not to, and shall cause Public Storage and its officers and directors not to, and shall cause Public Storage to not authorize and to use
reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company

definitive agreement providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company or the Partnership to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing referred in this clause (D), other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), or (E) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the
commencement of the Company’s obligations under Section 5.6(b) and Section 5.6(c) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the parties hereto agree that the
Company, Public Storage and their respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.6(a) with respect to each
Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote, including with respect to any amended or revised Company Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party following the No-Shop
Period Start Date and the restrictions in Section 5.6(b) or Section 5.6(c) shall not apply with respect to an Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or
group is an Excluded Party).
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and Public Storage may, directly or indirectly, through any
Representative, in response to an unsolicited written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal by a third party (including any Person or group of
Persons who has ceased to be an Excluded Party, after such Person or group of Persons has ceased to be an Excluded Party, and such Company
Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to be solicited by reason of the fact that such Person or group of Persons was solicited while an Excluded
Party) made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.6, it being agreed that the Company or any of its
Representatives may correspond in writing with any Person making such a written Company Acquisition Proposal to request clarification of the terms
and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal) (i) furnish non-public information to such third party (and such third party’s Representatives, including potential financing sources) making
such Company Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms no more favorable in any material respect to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions to the extent that it would prohibit the
making or amendment of any non-public Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (such confidentiality agreement, an “Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement”), and (B) any non-public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such third
party (or its Representatives) shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be provided to Parent as promptly as practicable after providing it to
such third party (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter)), and (ii) engage in, enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with such third party (and such third party’s Representatives) with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
A-44

financial advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.
(d) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48)
hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary
by any third party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any other Inquiry from any
Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company regarding a possible Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made in
writing and shall identify the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and indicate the material terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposals or Inquiries, to the extent known (including, if applicable, providing copies of any written Company Acquisition
Proposals or Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto, which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of
the business or operations of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry). The Company shall also promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent, in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or
provides nonpublic information to any Person in each case in accordance with Section 5.6(c), notify Parent of any change to the financial and other
material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any
Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry on a reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all written proposals, offers, drafts of
proposed agreements or correspondence relating thereto (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the
business or operations of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall,
after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidential or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.
(e) Except as permitted by this Section 5.6(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.6(e), an “Adverse
Recommendation Change”), or (iv) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable
or recommend), or cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 5.6). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if an
Intervening Event has occurred and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, or (B) if the Company has not breached this Section
5.6(e) or Section 5.6(f) (other than, in the case of Section 5.6(f) any breach that has a de minimis effect) and has not breached the other subsections of
this Section 5.6 in any material respect, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) if the
Company Board has received (x) after the date hereof and prior to the Cut-Off Time from an Excluded Party a Company Acquisition Proposal or (y) after
the No-Shop Period Start Date, an unsolicited written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal that, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.6 and in the good faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied (other than any non-compliance that has a de minimis effect) with, and giving effect to
all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.6(f), and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn.
(f) The Company Board shall only be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(i) as permitted under Section 5.6(e) if (i) the Company has
A-45
Table of Contents
provided a prior written notice (a “Notice of Change of Recommendation”) to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, identifying the Person
making the Superior Proposal and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that is the
basis of such action, including, if applicable, copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to a Superior
Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Change of Recommendation and
ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such 3rd Business Day (a “Notice of Change Period”), the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or, in the case of an
Intervening Event, in order to obviate the need to make such Adverse Recommendation Change; and (iii) following the end of the Notice of Change
Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation or otherwise, that (A) the
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change of Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening
Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its duties
under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation, and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.6(f); provided, however, that the
Notice of Change Period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of Recommendation
and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such 2nd Business Day.
(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company’s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Law or if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the
Company or the Company Board of a “stop, look and listen” or similar statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be
permitted to recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is a
Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 5.6(e).
(h) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any
standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, except solely to allow the applicable party to make a
non-public Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board or to allow the disclosure of information to financing sources and/or teaming
arrangements. Other than in connection with the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
and the Company Board shall not take any actions to exempt any person from the “Ownership Limit” (including any increased “Ownership Limit” for
such Person) as such term is defined in the Company Charter unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i).

however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, (a) issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by
applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement

release or public statement) upon any such press release or public statement, (b) make any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
Mergers that are substantially similar to those in the Proxy Statement or in previous press releases or public statements made by the Company or Parent

in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.7 shall
not apply to the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC or the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s shareholders, which actions shall
instead be governed by Section 5.3.

premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the “Maximum Amount”) to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; provided
further that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and
the Surviving Company shall procure and maintain for such six-year period the most advantageous policies as can be reasonably obtained for the
Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall have the option to cause coverage to be extended
under the Company’s D&O Insurance by obtaining a six-year “tail” policy or policies on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Company’s
existing D&O Insurance, subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos above in this Section 5.8(b), and such “tail” policy or policies shall satisfy the
provisions of this Section 5.8(b).
(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.8 shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
Mergers and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.8 applies (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8, each of whom

that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, or
if Parent dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.
(d) For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership shall provide to the Indemnified Parties the same rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided to the
Indemnified Parties under the provisions of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect
as of the date hereof and the Surviving Company’s and the Surviving Partnership’s charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents shall not contain
any provisions inconsistent with such rights. The contractual indemnification rights set forth in Section 5.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter in
existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be assumed by the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Company Merger Effective Time.

such Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting
periods or other restrictions that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
Company Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Company Employees to the extent such

(a) During the Interim Period, the Company and any Company Subsidiary that is a REIT may make distributions to its shareholders and the
Partnership may make distributions to the partners of the Partnership, including the Company, to allow the Company to make distributions to its
shareholders, in each case (i) reasonably necessary (after giving effect to the distributions contemplated by clause (ii)) for the Company or any such
Company Subsidiary to (A) maintain its status as a REIT under the Code, or (B) avoid the imposition of any income or excise Tax under Sections 857 or

clauses (i) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Per Company Share Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
amount per Company Share of such distribution and (y) the Partnership declares a distribution to the holders of Common Partnership Units pursuant to
clauses (i) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration shall be decreased, without duplication, by an
amount equal to the amount per Common Partnership Unit of such distribution (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, any dividend or
distribution contemplated by clauses (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall not result in any change to the Per Company Share Merger
Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration). In the event that a distribution permitted under the terms of this Agreement (1) has a
record date prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and (2) has not been paid as of the close of business on the date immediately prior to the
Closing Date, such distribution shall be paid by the Company or Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time to the applicable holders of record of the underlying security as of such record date.
(b) The Company may declare and pay a cash dividend on the Company Shares (including Company Shares subject to Company RSU
Awards) and the Partnership may declare and pay a cash distribution on the Common Partnership Units, in each case, up to an amount per Company
Share and Common Partnership Unit, as applicable, equal to the Pro Rata Dividend Amount (as defined below) to be paid to holders of record as of the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and payable on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time to the applicable holders of record of the underlying security as of such record date. The “Pro Rata Dividend Amount” shall equal
an amount per Company Share and Common Partnership Unit equal to (A) $1.05, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of

and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such calendar quarter; provided, that if a regular quarterly cash dividend has been declared
or paid during such calendar quarter, then the Pro Rata Dividend Amount shall equal $0.
(c) Subject to the Section 2-311 of the MGCL, the Company Board shall declare prior to the Closing Date a cash dividend to the holders of
Company Shares for the Company’s hypothetical short taxable year ending on the Closing Date as a result of the Mergers (the “Hypothetical Short
Taxable Year”) in an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of (i) the estimated amount required to be distributed pursuant to Section 857(a) of the Code
with respect to the Company’s Hypothetical Short Taxable Year (taking into account all distributions made by the Company prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time) such that the Company will not be subject to Tax under Sections 857(b) or 4981 of the Code with respect to such Hypothetical Short
Taxable Year or the Company’s taxable year ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) the estimated accumulated earnings and profits of the Company pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.312-6 calculated for the Hypothetical Short Taxable Year, in each case, as reasonably determined by the Company in
consultation with Parent; provided, that any such distribution of cash shall not exceed the amount of the Partnership Closing Cash Distribution to be
distributed to the Company (such aggregate dividend, the “Closing Cash Dividend”). The Closing Cash Dividend shall be designated, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, as a “capital gains dividend” under Section 857(b) of the Code. The Closing Cash Dividend shall be paid to holders of
record as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and payable on the Closing Date immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time to the applicable holders of record of the underlying Company Shares as of such record date. The Company shall
provide to the transfer agent of the Company Shares all of the cash necessary to pay the Closing Cash Dividend to be paid pursuant to this Section

Partnership shall declare prior to the Closing Date a cash distribution to the holders of Common Partnership Units (including the Company, as to its
Common Partnership Units) in an aggregate amount of cash equal to (x) the Closing Cash Dividend (disregarding the proviso in the first sentence of this
Section 5.11(c)) divided by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of outstanding Common Partnership Units held by the Company and the
denominator of which is the total number of outstanding Common Partnership Units, in each case, as of the record date of such distribution; provided,
that any such distribution of cash shall not exceed the Partnership’s and any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries’ available cash

indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code in such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not
A-62Table of Contents
constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Company’s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Company’s counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
receipt by the Company of the Section 7.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or, alternatively, the Company’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Company of the Section 7.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Section 7.3 Amount to the Company.
Parent agrees to amend this Section 7.4 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Section 7.3 Amount that may
be distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y)
improve the Company’s chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 7.4(b) or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal
opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 7.4(b). Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.4
so long as it deposits into escrow the Section 7.3 Amount, notwithstanding any delay or reduction in payment to the Company, and shall have no further
liability with respect to payment of the Section 7.3 Amount. The portion of Section 7.3 Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be
paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 7.4. The Company shall fully indemnify
Parent and hold Parent harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by it resulting directly or indirectly from the escrow agreement.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Company or the Partnership do not perform any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of them hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with the
Agreement’s specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by the
Company and the Partnership and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent, Merger Sub I
or Merger Sub II are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief on the basis that any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent a breach or breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with the request for or grant of any such order or injunction. Each of the Company
and the Partnership agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. The parties hereto agree that neither the Company nor the Partnership
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and that the Company’s and the Partnership’s sole and exclusive remedy
relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in Section 7.3(c), as set forth in
the penultimate sentence of Section 7.3(d) and indemnification, payment and reimbursement pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5.12 and the last
sentence of Section 5.15(a); provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent of
Section 5.2(b).
(b) The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to Section 8.8(a) shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this
Agreement, including under Section 7.3, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in Section
8.8(a) are not available or otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any of Parent’s, Merger Sub I’s or Merger Sub II’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this Section 8.8 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding by any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking remedies pursuant to Section 8.8(a) or anything set forth
in this Section 8.8 restrict or limit Parent’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company or the Partnership or their affiliates relating to the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be

consummated, or a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder, shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the Parent Termination Amount, plus (ii) amounts payable or reimbursable
pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 7.3(d), plus (iii) Parent’s indemnification, payment and reimbursement obligations pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 5.12 and the last sentence of Section 5.15(a) (collectively, the “Liability Limitation”), and in no event shall the Company or the
Partnership or any of their affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it has
no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to the
extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement), through Parent,
Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II against any Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the
Guarantor (but not any other Parent Party) under and to the extent provided in the Guaranty and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other
limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Partnership

decreased and the number of shares of the latter class shall be automatically increased, in each case by the number of shares so classified or reclassified,
so that the aggregate number of shares of stock of all classes that the Corporation has authority to issue shall not be more than the total number of
shares of stock set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph. The Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire Board of Directors
and without any action by the stockholders of the Corporation, may amend the Charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of
shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Corporation has authority to issue.
Section 5.2 Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of Article VI, each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each

to time in one or more classes or series of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.
Section 5.3 Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors may classify any unissued shares of Preferred Stock and reclassify any previously classified
but unissued shares of Preferred Stock of any series from time to time, in one or more classes or series of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. 9,200 shares
of the Corporation’s authorized Preferred Stock shall be designated as “5.25% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series X” (“Series X Preferred Stock”), 8,000
shares of the Corporation’s authorized Preferred Stock shall be designated as “5.20% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Y” (“Series Y Preferred Stock”),

A-C-3
Table of Contents
distinguish it from all other classes and series of stock of the Corporation; (b) specify the number of shares to be included in the class or series; (c) set or
change, subject to the provisions of Article VI and subject to the express terms of any class or series of stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time,
the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and
conditions of redemption for each class or series; and (d) cause the Corporation to file articles supplementary with the SDAT. Any of the terms of any
class or series of stock set or changed pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 5.4 may be made dependent upon facts or events ascertainable outside the
Charter (including determinations or actions by the Board of Directors or other facts or events within the control of the Corporation) and may vary among
holders thereof, provided that the manner in which such facts, events or variations shall operate upon the terms of such class or series of stock is clearly
and expressly set forth in the articles supplementary filed with the SDAT.
Section 5.5 Authorization by the Board of Directors of Stock Issuance. The Board of Directors, without approval of the stockholders of the
Corporation, may authorize the issuance from time to time of shares of stock of the Corporation of any class or series, whether now or hereafter
authorized, or securities or rights convertible into shares of its stock of any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, for such consideration
(whether in cash, property, past or future services, obligation for future payment or otherwise) as the Board of Directors may deem advisable (or without
consideration in the case of a stock split or stock dividend), subject to such restrictions or limitations, if any, as may be set forth in the Charter or the
Bylaws.
Section 5.6 Preemptive and Appraisal Rights. Except as may be provided by the Board of Directors in setting the terms of classified or reclassified
shares of stock of the Corporation pursuant to Section 5.4 or as may otherwise be provided by contract, no holder of shares of stock shall, as such
holder, have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any additional shares of stock of the Corporation or any other security of the Corporation
which it may issue or sell. Holders of shares of stock shall not be entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided for under Title 3,
Subtitle 2 or Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the MGCL or any successor statute unless the Board of Directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors, shall determine that such rights apply, with respect to all or any classes or series of stock, to one or more transactions occurring after the date
of such determination in connection with which holders of such shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise such rights.
Section 5.7 Transferable Shares; Preferential Dividends. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Charter, no determination shall be made by the
Board of Directors nor shall any transaction be entered into by the Corporation that would cause any shares or other beneficial interest in the
Corporation not to constitute “transferable shares” or “transferable certificates of beneficial interest” under Section 856(a)(2) of the Code or that would
cause any distribution to constitute a preferential dividend as described in Section 562(c) of the Code.

Section 6.2.3 No Ownership Producing “Closely Held” Status. Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in the Charter,

the Corporation being “closely held” within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is purportedly
held during the second half of a taxable year) or otherwise would result in the Corporation failing to qualify as a REIT.
Section 6.3 Remedies.
Section 6.3.1 Transfers in Trust. If, notwithstanding the other provisions contained in this Article VI, there is a purported
Transfer or other event that, if effective, would result in the violation of one or more of the restrictions on ownership and transfer described in Section 6.2,
then that number of shares of Stock the Beneficial Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 6.2 (rounded up to the next
whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Charitable Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 6.8, effective as of
the close of business on the day immediately prior to the date of such purported Transfer or other event, and such Person shall acquire no rights in such
shares of Stock.
Section 6.3.2 Void Ab Initio. If the transfer to the Charitable Trust described in Section 6.3.1 would not be effective for any reason
to prevent any Person from Beneficially Owning Stock in violation of Section 6.2, then the Transfer or other event that would otherwise cause such
Person to violate Section 6.2 shall be void ab initio.
Section 6.3.3 No Ownership by Less than 100 Persons. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter, unless determined
otherwise by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion, any Transfer of shares of Stock (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a
transaction engaged in through the facilities of the Exchange or any other automated inter-dealer quotation system) that, if effective, would result in
A-C-6
Table of Contents
the Stock being owned beneficially by less than 100 persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio, and
the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares of Stock; provided, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3.3 shall not apply to any
Transfer to, or by, any of the Sponsor Holders (including pursuant to the merger of Sequoia Merger Sub I LLC with and into the Corporation).
Section 6.3.4 Other Actions. In addition to, and without limitation by, Sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.3 above, if the Board of Directors
or its designees shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer or other event has taken place in violation of Article VI or that a Person intends
to acquire or has attempted to acquire, ownership, beneficial ownership (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) or Beneficial
Ownership of any Stock in violation of Article VI (whether or not the violation is intended), the Board of Directors or its designees shall take such action
as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, but not limited to, causing the Corporation to
redeem Stock, refuse to give effect to such Transfer or other event on the books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or
other event; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 6.2 shall automatically result in the transfer
to the Charitable Trust described in Section 6.3.1, without regard to any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors, and if applicable, such Transfer
or other event shall be void ab initio as provided above without regard to any action or inaction by the Board of Directors or its designees.
Section 6.3.5 No Limit on Authority. Nothing contained in Section 6.3 shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take
such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of its stockholders by preservation of the Corporation’s
status as a REIT.
Section 6.4 Waivers and Exceptions.
Section 6.4.1 Board May Grant Exceptions. Subject to Section 6.2.3, the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may grant to any Person an exception to the Ownership Limit set forth in Section 6.2.1 with respect to Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock if
the Board of Directors shall have determined that the Corporation would not be “closely held” within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without
regard to whether the purported acquisition, Transfer or other event takes place during the second half of a taxable year) and would not otherwise fail to
qualify as a REIT, after giving effect to an acquisition by such Person of Beneficial Ownership of the maximum amount of Common Stock and Preferred
Stock permitted as a result of the exception to be granted, and taking into account the existing and permitted ownership by other Persons of the Stock of
the Corporation (taking into account any other exceptions granted under this Section 6.4.1). If a member of the Board of Directors requests that the Board
of Directors grant an exception to the Ownership Limit with respect to such member or with respect to any other Person if such member of the Board of
Directors would be considered to be the Beneficial Owner of shares of Stock owned by such Person, such member of the Board of Directors shall not
participate in the decision of the Board of Directors as to whether to grant any such exception.
Section 6.4.2 Conditions to Exceptions. As a condition to the granting of an exception under Section 6.4.1 to any Person, the
Board of Directors may require such Person to provide the Board of Directors such representations and undertakings as the Board of Directors may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, require (including, without limitation, an agreement as to a reduced Ownership Limit for such Person with respect to the
Beneficial Ownership of one or more other classes of Stock not subject to the exception), and such Person must agree that any violation of such
representations and undertakings or attempted violations will result in the application of the remedies set forth in Section 6.3 with respect to shares of
Stock producing the violation or attempted violation. In addition, prior to granting any exception, the Board of Directors may require a ruling from the IRS
or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion as it may deem
necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Corporation’s status as a REIT, provided, however, that obtaining a favorable ruling or opinion
shall not be required for the Board of Directors to grant an exception.

acquire Stock or other securities in violation of Article VI or any Person (other than a Sponsor Holder) who is a transferee in a Transfer or is otherwise

Corporation to maintain its status as a Real Estate Investment Trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Except as set forth in Article

more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, with certain further restrictions and exceptions as are set
forth in the Corporation’s Charter. Any Person who attempts to own or Beneficially Own Stock in excess of the above limitations must notify the
Corporation in writing at least 15 days prior to such attempt. If any of the restrictions on transfer or ownership set forth in Article VI of the Charter are
violated, the Stock represented hereby will be automatically transferred to the Charitable Trustee of a Charitable Trust for the benefit of a Charitable
Beneficiary pursuant to the terms of Article VI of the Charter. In addition, attempted transfers of Stock in violation of the limitations described above (as
modified or expanded upon in Article VI of the Charter), may be void ab initio. All capitalized terms in this legend have the meanings defined in the
Corporation’s Charter, as the same may be amended from time to time. The Corporation will furnish to the holder hereof, upon request and without charge,
a copy of the Charter. Requests for the Charter may be directed to the corporate secretary.”
Section 6.8 Transfer of Stock in Trust.
Section 6.8.1 Ownership in Trust; Status of Shares Held in Charitable Trust. Upon any purported Transfer (whether or not such
Transfer is the result of a transaction engaged in through the facilities of the Exchange or any other automated inter-dealer quotation system) or other
event that results in the transfer of Stock to a Charitable Trust pursuant to Section 6.3, such shares of Stock shall be deemed to have been transferred
A-C-8
Table of Contents
to the Charitable Trustee in its capacity as Charitable Trustee for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. Each Charitable Beneficiary
shall be designated by the Corporation as provided in Section 6.8.6. Shares of Stock so held in Charitable Trust shall remain issued and outstanding
shares of Stock of the Corporation and shall be entitled to the same rights and privileges on identical terms and conditions as are all other issued and
outstanding shares of Stock of the same class and series.
The Purported Owner shall not benefit economically from ownership of any shares of Stock held in Charitable Trust by the Charitable Trustee, shall
have no rights to dividends and shall not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares held in Charitable Trust. The Purported
Owner of shares of Stock in violation of Section 6.2 shall have no claim, cause of action, or any other recourse whatsoever against the purported
transferor of such shares.
Section 6.8.2 Distribution and Dividend Rights. The Charitable Trustee shall have all rights to distributions and dividends with
respect to shares of Stock held in the Charitable Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any
distributions or dividend declared but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Charitable Trustee. Any distributions or dividends paid prior to the discovery
by the Corporation that the shares of Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee with respect to such shares shall be paid over to the
Charitable Trustee by the recipient upon demand. The Corporation may take all measures that it determines reasonably necessary to recover the amount
of any such distribution, including, if necessary, withholding any portion of future distributions payable on shares of Stock of the Purported Owner or
amounts otherwise payable to the Purported Owner (such as pursuant to Section 6.8.4); and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Corporation’s receipt or withholding thereof, shall pay over to the Charitable Trustee, the distributions so received or withheld, as the case may be. Any
distributions or dividends so paid over to the Charitable Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable Beneficiary.
Section 6.8.3 Rights upon Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or
any distribution of the assets of the Corporation, the Charitable Trustee shall be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of Stock of the class or
series of Stock that is held in the Charitable Trust, that portion of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of such class or
series (determined based upon the ratio that the number of shares of such class or series of Stock held by the Charitable Trustee bears to the total number
of shares of such class or series of Stock then outstanding). The Charitable Trustee shall distribute any such assets received in respect of the Stock held
in the Charitable Trust in any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of, or distribution of the assets of the Corporation in accordance with Section 6.8.4.
Section 6.8.4 Sale of Shares by Charitable Trustee. As reasonably promptly as possible after receiving notice from the
Corporation that shares of Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, in an orderly fashion so as not to affect the Market Price of the shares
held in the Charitable Trust materially and adversely, the Charitable Trustee shall sell the shares held in Charitable Trust to a Person, designated by the
Charitable Trustee, whose ownership of the shares of Stock held in the Charitable Trust would not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section
6.2. Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net
proceeds of the sale to the Purported Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section 6.8.4.
The Charitable Trustee shall first pay all reasonable expenses of the Charitable Trust and of the Corporation incurred in connection with the
formation of the Charitable Trust and disposition of the shares. The Purported Owner shall receive out of any excess the lesser of (1) (x) the price per
share such Purported Owner paid for the Stock in the purported Transfer that resulted in the transfer of shares of Stock to the Charitable Trust, or (y) if
the Transfer or other event that resulted in the transfer of shares of Stock to the Charitable Trust was not a transaction in which the Purported Owner
gave full value for such shares of Stock, a price per share equal to the Market Price on the date of the purported Transfer or other event that resulted in
the transfer of such shares of Stock to the Charitable Trust and (2) the price per share received by the Charitable Trustee from the sale or other
A-C-9
Table of Contents
disposition of the shares held in the Charitable Trust. Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Purported Owner shall be
immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.
If, prior to the discovery by the Corporation that shares of Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, such shares are sold by the
Purported Owner, then (i) such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Charitable Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Purported Owner
received an amount for such shares that exceeds the amount such Purported Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 6.8.4, such excess
shall be paid to the Charitable Trustee upon demand.
The Charitable Trustee shall have the right and power (but not the obligation) to offer any share of Stock held in the Charitable Trust for sale to the
Corporation on such terms and conditions as the Charitable Trustee shall determine appropriate.
Each Charitable Beneficiary and Purported Owner waive any and all claims that they may have against the Charitable Trustee and the Corporation
arising out of the disposition of shares, except for claims arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Charitable Trustee or the
Corporation, or the Charitable Trustee’s or the Corporation’s failure to make payments in accordance with Section 6.8.
Section 6.8.5 Voting and Notice Rights. The Charitable Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to receive any notice of any
meetings, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Purported Owner shall have no voting rights with
respect to shares held in Charitable Trust. Any vote by or on behalf of a Purported Owner as a holder of shares of Stock prior to the discovery by the
Corporation that the shares of Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trust shall be subject to rescission by the Charitable Trustee if the rescission
is permitted by applicable law and the Board of Directors concludes that the rescission will not materially and adversely affect the Corporation. In the
case of any such rescission, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such votes shall be void ab initio with respect to the shares held by the
Charitable Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VI, until the Corporation has received notification that shares of Stock have been transferred to the
Charitable Trustee, the Corporation shall be entitled to rely on its share transfer and other stockholder records for purposes of preparing lists of
stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and authority of proxies and otherwise conducting votes of stockholders.
Section 6.8.6 Designation of Charitable Beneficiary(ies). By written notice to the Charitable Trustee, the Corporation shall
designate one or more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest in the Charitable Trust such that (1) the shares of Stock held
in the Charitable Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 6.2 in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary and (2) each Charitable
Beneficiary is described in Sections 501(c)(3), 170(b)(1)(A) and 170(c)(2) of the Code.
Section 6.9 Settlement. Nothing in this Article VI shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the Exchange
(but the fact that settlement of a transaction is permitted shall not negate the effect of any other provision and all of the provisions shall apply to the
purported transferee of the shares of Stock in such transaction).
ARTICLE VII
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION
OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
Section 7.1 Limitation of Director and Officer Liability. To the maximum extent that Maryland law in effect from time to time permits limitation of the
liability of directors and officers, no present or former director or officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for money
damages. Neither the
A-C-10
Table of Contents
amendment nor repeal of this Section 7.1, nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of the Charter or Bylaws of the Corporation inconsistent
with this Section 7.1, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding sentence with respect to any act or failure to act which
occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. In the absence of any Maryland statute limiting the liability of directors and officers of a Maryland
corporation for money damages in a suit by or on behalf of the Corporation or by any stockholder, no director or officer of the Corporation shall be liable
to the Corporation or to any stockholder for money damages except to the extent that (a) the director or officer actually received an improper benefit or
profit in money, property or services, for the amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or services actually received; or (b) a judgment or other
final adjudication adverse to the director or officer is entered in a proceeding based on a finding in the proceeding that the director’s or officer’s action or
failure to act was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding.
Section 7.2 Indemnification.
(a) To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bylaws and
any indemnification agreement or resolution of the Board of Directors in effect from time to time, the Corporation shall indemnify, and pay or reimburse
the reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to, (i) any present or former director or officer of the Corporation against any
claim or liability to which he or she may become subject by reason of service in such capacity, and (ii) any individual who, while a director or officer of the
Corporation and at the request of the Corporation, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner or trustee of another corporation, real estate
investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, limited liability company or any other enterprise from and against any claim or
liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her service in such capacity. In addition, the
Corporation may, with the approval of the Board of Directors, provide such indemnification and advancement of expenses to any individual who served a
predecessor of the Corporation in any of the capacities described in (i) or (ii) above and to any employee or agent of the Corporation or a predecessor of
the Corporation. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 7.2, nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of this Charter or the
Bylaws inconsistent with this Section 7.2, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of this section with respect to any act or failure to act
that occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.
(b) The Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person described in the preceding
paragraph against any liability which may be asserted against such person.
(c) The indemnification provided herein shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Corporation to indemnify any other person for any such
expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law, nor shall it be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification from the
Corporation may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

ANNEX A
5.25% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES X
The following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the 5.25% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series X (the “Series X Preferred Stock”) as set forth
below shall be deemed to be part of Article V of the Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the “Charter”) of PS Business Parks, Inc. (the
“Corporation”), with any necessary or appropriate changes to the enumeration or lettering of sections or subsections hereof:
(a)
Dividend Rights.
(1) Dividends shall be payable in cash on the shares of Series X Preferred Stock when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of
funds legally available therefor: (i) for the period (the “Initial Dividend Period”) from the Deemed Original Issue Date (as defined below) to but excluding
January 1, 2018 (to be paid on December 28, 2017), and (ii) for each quarterly dividend period thereafter (the Initial Dividend Period and each quarterly
dividend period being hereinafter individually referred to as a “Dividend Period” and collectively referred to as “Dividend Periods”), which quarterly
Dividend Periods shall be in four equal amounts and shall commence on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 in each year (each, a “Dividend Period
Commencement Date”), commencing on January 1, 2018, and shall end on and include the day next preceding the next Dividend Period Commencement
Date, at a rate per annum equal to 5.25% of the $25,000 per share stated value thereof (the “Dividend Rate”). Dividends on each share of Series X
Preferred Stock shall be cumulative from the Deemed Original Issue Date of such share and shall be payable, without interest thereon, when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors, on or before March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (except in the case of the dividend for the Initial
Dividend Period which will be paid December 28, 2017) of each year, commencing on December 28, 2017 (for the period from the Deemed Original Issue
Date to but excluding January 1, 2018) or, in the case of shares of Series X Preferred Stock with a Deemed Original Issue Date after December 28, 2017, the
first such dividend payment date following such Deemed Original Issue Date; provided, that if any such day shall be a Saturday, Sunday, or a day on
which banking institutions in the State of New York or the State of California are authorized or obligated by law to close, or a day which is or is declared a
national or a New York or California state holiday (any of the foregoing a “Non-Business Day”), then the payment date shall be the next succeeding day
which is not a Non-Business Day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of Series X Preferred Stock as they appear on the
stock register of the Corporation on such record date, not more than 45 days nor less than 15 days preceding the payment date thereof, as shall be fixed
by the Board of Directors. Dividends on account of arrears for any past Dividend Periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any
regular dividend payment date, to holders of record on such date, not more than 45 days nor less than 15 days preceding the payment date thereof, as
may be fixed by the Board of Directors. After full cumulative dividends on Series X Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set
aside for payment, including for the then current Dividend Period, the holders of shares of Series X Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further
dividends with respect to that Dividend Period.
“Deemed Original Issue Date” means (a) in the case of any share which is part of the first issuance of shares of Series X Preferred Stock or part of
a subsequent issuance of shares of Series X Preferred Stock prior to January 1, 2018, the date of such first issuance and (b) in the case of any share which
is part of a subsequent issuance of shares of Series X Preferred Stock on or after January 1, 2018, the later of (x) January 1, 2018 and (y) the latest
Dividend Period Commencement Date which precedes the date of issuance of such share and which succeeds the last Dividend Period for which full
cumulative dividends have been paid; provided that, in the case of any share which is part of a subsequent issuance, the date of issuance of which falls
between (i) the record date for dividends payable on the first succeeding dividend payment date and (ii) such dividend payment date, the “Deemed
Original Issue Date” means the date of the Dividend Period Commencement Date that immediately follows the date of issuance.

Table of Contents
(2) Dividends payable on shares of Series X Preferred Stock for any period greater or less than a full Dividend Period, including the Initial
Dividend Period, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(3) The Corporation shall not declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends on any series of preferred shares ranking, as to
dividends, on a parity with the shares of Series X Preferred Stock unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and
paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof is set apart for payment, for all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment
of any such dividends on such other series of preferred shares. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series X Preferred Stock and any
other series of preferred shares ranking on a parity therewith as to dividends (including, without limitation, the shares of the Corporation’s 5.20%
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Y (the “Series Y Preferred Stock”), and 4.875% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Z (the “Series Z Preferred
Stock”)), all dividends declared upon shares of Series X Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred shares ranking on a parity therewith as to
dividends shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on the shares of Series X Preferred Stock and such other series of
preferred shares shall in all cases bear to each other that same ratio that the accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series X Preferred Stock
and such other series of preferred shares bear to each other. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, unless full cumulative dividends on the shares
of Series X Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set aside for payment for all past Dividend Periods, no dividends (other than in
shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.01 per share (together with any other shares of capital stock of the Corporation into which such
shares shall be reclassified or changed, the “Common Shares”), or another stock ranking junior to the shares of Series X Preferred Stock as to dividends
and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be made upon the Common Shares or on any
other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the shares of Series X Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation. Unless full
cumulative dividends on the shares of Series X Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment for all past Dividend
Periods, no Common Shares or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the shares of Series X Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for
a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation or any subsidiary, except by conversion into or exchange for stock
of the Corporation ranking junior to the shares of Series X Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation.
(b)
Liquidation.
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series X Preferred
Stock are entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to shareholders, before any distribution of assets is made to
holders of Common Shares or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the shares of Series X Preferred Stock upon liquidation, liquidating
distributions in the amount of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) for the then current and all
past Dividend Periods. If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation the amounts payable with respect
to the shares of Series X Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Corporation ranking as to any such distribution on a parity with the shares of Series
X Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of shares of Series X Preferred Stock and of such other shares (including the shares of the Series Y
Preferred Stock, and the Series Z Preferred Stock) will share ratably in any such distribution of assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full
respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which they are entitled, the
holders of shares of Series X Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Corporation.
(1) Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the
place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than
30 nor more than 60 days prior to the
A-C-A-2
Table of Contents
payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the shares of Series X Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall
appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.
(2) For purposes of liquidation rights, a reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or
corporations or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation.
(c)
Redemption.
(1) Except as provided in clause (9) below, the shares of Series X Preferred Stock are not redeemable prior to September 21, 2022. On and
after such date, the shares of Series X Preferred Stock are redeemable at the option of the Corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors, in whole or
in part, from time to time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a cash redemption price of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to the date of redemption.
(2) If fewer than all the outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed will be
determined by the Board of Directors, and such shares shall be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number
of such shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares) or by lot in a manner determined by the Board of
Directors.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any dividends, including any accumulation, on the shares of Series X Preferred Stock are in arrears, no
shares of Series X Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the
Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series X Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series X Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer provided such offer is made
on the same terms to all holders of shares of Series X Preferred Stock.
(4) Immediately prior to any redemption of shares of Series X Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and
unpaid dividends through the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls after a dividend payment record date and prior to the corresponding
dividend payment date, in which case each holder of shares of Series X Preferred Stock at the close of business on such dividend payment record date
shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares
before such dividend payment date. Except as expressly provided herein above, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid
dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of Series X Preferred Stock called for redemption.
(5) A notice of redemption (which may be contingent on the occurrence of a future event) will be mailed by the Corporation by first class
mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to
such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. The failure
to give such notice or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series X Preferred
Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of
Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all
the shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of
Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.
(6) In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series X Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of the shares to be redeemed, such record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption.
A-C-A-3
Table of Contents
(7) Notice having been given as provided above, from and after the date fixed for the redemption of shares of Series X Preferred Stock by
the Corporation (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available the money necessary to effect such redemption), the holders of shares selected for
redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation by virtue thereof and
shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the moneys payable upon such redemption from the
Corporation, less any required tax withholding amount, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement or assignment of transfer, if required
by the Corporation and so stated in the notice) of their certificates, and the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. If
fewer than all the shares represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued, without cost to the holder thereof, representing the
unredeemed shares. The Corporation may, at its option, at any time after a notice of redemption has been given, deposit the redemption price for the
shares of Series X Preferred Stock designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed
for redemption, with the transfer agent or agents for Series X Preferred Stock, as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series X
Preferred Stock designated for redemption, together with irrevocable instructions and authority to such transfer agent or agents that such funds be
delivered upon redemption of such shares and to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the redemption price of the shares to
their respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the making of such deposit, the holders of the shares designated for
redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation by virtue thereof and
shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive from such trust fund the moneys payable upon such
redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement, if required by the Corporation) of their certificates, and the shares represented
thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. Any balance of such moneys remaining unclaimed at the end of the five-year period commencing
on the date fixed for redemption shall be repaid to the Corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.
(8) Any shares of Series X Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed or otherwise reacquired shall, after such redemption,
have the status of authorized but unissued preferred shares, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a
particular series by the Board of Directors.
(9) If the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall, at any time and in good faith, be of the opinion that ownership of securities of the
Corporation has or may become concentrated to an extent that may prevent the Corporation from qualifying as a real estate investment trust under the
REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (as defined below), then the Board of Directors shall have the power, by lot or other means deemed
equitable by them to prevent the transfer of and/or to call for redemption a number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock sufficient, in the opinion of the
Board of Directors, to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership thereof into conformity with the requirements of such a real estate investment
trust under the REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The redemption price to be paid for shares of Series X Preferred Stock so called for
redemption, on the date fixed for redemption, shall be the closing price of the shares on the principal national stock exchange on which the shares are
listed on the last business day prior to the redemption date, or if no sales of shares were made on such date, the average of the highest bid and the lowest
asked quotations on the last business day prior to the redemption date as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or a similar
organization selected from time to time by the Corporation or if there be no such bid and asked quotations, $25,000 per share; provided that if interests in
shares of Series X Preferred Stock are represented by depositary shares, then the redemption price shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
but with respect to one depositary share, multiplied by the number of depositary shares that together represent an interest in one share of Series X
Preferred Stock. From and after the date fixed for redemption by the Board of Directors, the holder of any shares of Series X Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall cease to be entitled to any distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of Series X Preferred Stock, other
than the right to payment of the redemption price determined as aforesaid. “REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code” shall mean Sections 856
through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order to
A-C-A-4
Table of Contents
exercise the redemption option set forth in this clause (9), with respect to the shares of Series X Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall mail a notice of
redemption by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the
Corporation. The failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of
any Series X Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the
number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date.
If fewer than all the shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the
number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.
(d) Voting Rights. The shares of Series X Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers either general or special, except as required by law,
except that:
(1) If the Corporation shall fail to pay full cumulative dividends on the shares of Series X Preferred Stock or any other of its preferred shares
for six quarterly dividend payment periods, whether or not consecutive (a “Dividend Default”), the holders of all outstanding preferred shares that are
similarly entitled to this right, voting as a single class without regard to series, will be entitled to elect two Directors until full cumulative dividends for all
past dividend payment periods on all preferred shares have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment. Such right to vote separately
as a class to elect Directors shall, when vested, be subject, always, to the same provisions for the vesting of such right to elect Directors separately as a
class in the case of future Dividend Defaults. At any time when such right to elect Directors separately as a class shall have so vested, the Corporation
may call, and, upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than 10% of the total number of preferred shares of the Corporation then
outstanding, shall call, a special meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors. In the case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be
held within 90 days after the delivery of such request and, in either case, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the Bylaws of the
Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to call such a special meeting if such request is received less than 120 days before the
date fixed for the next ensuing Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation and the holders of all classes of outstanding preferred shares are
afforded the opportunity to elect such Directors (or fill any vacancy) at such Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Directors elected as aforesaid shall serve
until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified. If, prior to the end of
the term of any Director elected as aforesaid, a vacancy in the office of such Director shall occur during the continuance of a Dividend Default by reason
of death, resignation, or disability, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of a new Director for the unexpired term of such
former Director, such appointment to be made by the remaining Director elected as aforesaid.
(2) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, will be required for any amendment to the Charter that will adversely alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of
the shares of Series X Preferred Stock, except as set forth below. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Series X Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred shares similarly entitled to this right and ranking on a parity with Series X Preferred
Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation (including the shares of the Series Y Preferred Stock and the Series Z Preferred Stock), voting as a single class
without regard to series, will be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of any class or series of shares ranking prior to Series X
Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase
any such security. In addition, the Charter may be amended to increase the number of authorized preferred shares ranking on a parity with or junior to
Series X Preferred Stock or to create another class of preferred shares ranking on a parity with or junior to Series X Preferred Stock without the vote of the
holders of outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock.

(3) Nothing herein shall be taken to require a class vote or consent in connection with the authorization, designation, increase or issuance
of any shares of any class or series (including additional preferred shares of any series) that rank junior to or on a parity with Series X Preferred Stock as
to dividends or liquidation rights or in connection with the authorization, designation, increase or issuance of any bonds, mortgages, debentures or other
debt obligations of the Corporation.

The following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the 5.20% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Y (the “Series Y Preferred Stock”) as set forth
below shall be deemed to be part of Article V of the Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the “Charter”) of PS Business Parks, Inc. (the
“Corporation”), with any necessary or appropriate changes to the enumeration or lettering of sections or subsections hereof:
(a)
Dividend Rights.
(1) Dividends shall be payable in cash on the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of
funds legally available therefor: (i) for the period (the “Initial Dividend Period”) from the Deemed Original Issue Date (as defined below) to but excluding
April 1, 2018 (to be paid on March 29, 2018), and (ii) for each quarterly dividend period thereafter (the Initial Dividend Period and each quarterly dividend
period being hereinafter individually referred to as a “Dividend Period” and collectively referred to as “Dividend Periods”), which quarterly Dividend
Periods shall be in four equal amounts and shall commence on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 in each year (each, a “Dividend Period
Commencement Date”), commencing on April 1, 2018, and shall end on and include the day next preceding the next Dividend Period Commencement
Date, at a rate per annum equal to 5.20% of the $25,000 per share stated value thereof (the “Dividend Rate”). Dividends on each share of Series Y Preferred
Stock shall be cumulative from the Deemed Original Issue Date of such share and shall be payable, without interest thereon, when, as and if declared by
the Board of Directors, on or before March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (except in the case of dividend for the Initial Dividend Period
which will be paid March 29, 2018) of each year, commencing on March 29, 2018 (for the period from the Deemed Original Issue Date to but excluding
April 1, 2018) or, in the case of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock with a Deemed Original Issue Date after March 29, 2018, the first such dividend payment
date following such Deemed Original Issue Date; provided, that if any such day shall be a Saturday, Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions in the
State of New York or the State of California are authorized or obligated by law to close, or a day which is or is declared a national or a New York or
California state holiday (any of the foregoing a “Non-Business Day”), then the payment date shall be the next succeeding day which is not a Non-
Business Day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the
Corporation on such record date, not more than 45 days nor less than 15 days preceding the payment date thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of
Directors. Dividends on account of arrears for any past Dividend Periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any regular dividend
payment date, to holders of record on such date, not more than 45 days nor less than 15 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the
Board of Directors. After full cumulative dividends on Series Y Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set aside for payment,
including for the then current Dividend Period, the holders of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further dividends with respect
to that Dividend Period.
“Deemed Original Issue Date” means (a) in the case of any share which is part of the first issuance of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock or part of
a subsequent issuance of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock prior to April 1, 2018, the date of such first issuance and (b) in the case of any share which is
part of a subsequent issuance of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock on or after April 1, 2018, the later of (x) April 1, 2018 and (y) the latest Dividend Period
Commencement Date which precedes the date of issuance of such share and which succeeds the last Dividend Period for which full cumulative dividends
have been paid; provided that, in the case of any share which is part of a subsequent issuance, the date of issuance of which falls between (i) the record
date for dividends payable on the first succeeding dividend payment date and (ii) such dividend payment date, the “Deemed Original Issue Date” means
the date of the Dividend Period Commencement Date that immediately follows the date of issuance.

(2) Dividends payable on shares of Series Y Preferred Stock for any period greater or less than a full Dividend Period, including the Initial
Dividend Period, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(3) The Corporation shall not declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends on any series of preferred shares ranking, as to
dividends, on a parity with the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and
paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof is set apart for payment, for all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment
of any such dividends on such other series of preferred shares. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock and any
other series of preferred shares ranking on a parity therewith as to dividends (including, without limitation, the shares of the Corporation’s 5.25%
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series X (the “Series X Preferred Stock”), and 4.875% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Z (the “Series Z Preferred
Stock”)), all dividends declared upon shares of Series Y Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred shares ranking on a parity therewith as to
dividends shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock and such other series of
preferred shares shall in all cases bear to each other that same ratio that the accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock
and such other series of preferred shares bear to each other. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, unless full cumulative dividends on the shares
of Series Y Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment for all past Dividend Periods, no dividends (other than in
shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.01 per share (together with any other shares of capital stock of the Corporation into which such
shares shall be reclassified or changed, the “Common Shares”), or another stock ranking junior to the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock as to dividends
and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be made upon the Common Shares or on any
other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation. Unless full
cumulative dividends on the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment for all past Dividend
Periods, no Common Shares or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for
a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation or any subsidiary, except by conversion into or exchange for stock
of the Corporation ranking junior to the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation.
(b) Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of
Series Y Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to shareholders, before any distribution of
assets is made to holders of Common Shares or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock upon
liquidation, liquidating distributions in the amount of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) for
the then current and all past Dividend Periods. If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation the
amounts payable with respect to the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Corporation ranking as to any such distribution on a
parity with the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock and of such other shares (including
the shares of the Series X Preferred Stock and the Series Z Preferred Stock) will share ratably in any such distribution of assets of the Corporation in
proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which
they are entitled, the holders of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the
Corporation.
(1) Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the
place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than
30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock at the respective
addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.
A-C-B-2
Table of Contents
(2) For purposes of liquidation rights, a reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or
corporations or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation.
(c) Redemption.
(1) Except as provided in clause (9) below, the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are not redeemable prior to December 7, 2022. On and after
such date, the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are redeemable at the option of the Corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors, in whole or in
part, from time to time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a cash redemption price of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to the date of redemption.
(2) If fewer than all the outstanding shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed will be
determined by the Board of Directors, and such shares shall be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number
of such shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares) or by lot in a manner determined by the Board of
Directors.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any dividends, including any accumulation, on the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are in arrears, no
shares of Series Y Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the
Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series Y Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer provided such offer is made
on the same terms to all holders of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock.
(4) Immediately prior to any redemption of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and
unpaid dividends through the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls after a dividend payment record date and prior to the corresponding
dividend payment date, in which case each holder of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock at the close of business on such dividend payment record date
shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares
before such dividend payment date. Except as expressly provided herein above, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid
dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of Series Y Preferred Stock called for redemption.
(5) A notice of redemption (which may be contingent on the occurrence of a future event) will be mailed by the Corporation by first class
mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to
such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. The failure
to give such notice or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series Y Preferred
Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of
Series Y Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all
the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of
Series Y Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.
(6) In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of the shares to be redeemed, such record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption.
(7) Notice having been given as provided above, from and after the date fixed for the redemption of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock by
the Corporation (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available the
A-C-B-3
Table of Contents
money necessary to effect such redemption), the holders of shares selected for redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares
and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation by virtue thereof and shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares,
except the right to receive the moneys payable upon such redemption from the Corporation, less any required tax withholding amount, without interest
thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement or assignment of transfer, if required by the Corporation and so stated in the notice) of their certificates, and
the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. If fewer than all the shares represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued, without cost to the holder thereof, representing the unredeemed shares. The Corporation may, at its option, at any time after a
notice of redemption has been given, deposit the redemption price for the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock designated for redemption and not yet
redeemed, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, with the transfer agent or agents for Series Y Preferred
Stock, as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock designated for redemption, together with irrevocable
instructions and authority to such transfer agent or agents that such funds be delivered upon redemption of such shares and to pay, on and after the
date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the redemption price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. From
and after the making of such deposit, the holders of the shares designated for redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and
shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation by virtue thereof and shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares, except the
right to receive from such trust fund the moneys payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement, if required
by the Corporation) of their certificates, and the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. Any balance of such moneys
remaining unclaimed at the end of the five-year period commencing on the date fixed for redemption shall be repaid to the Corporation upon its request
expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.
(8) Any shares of Series Y Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed or otherwise reacquired shall, after such redemption,
have the status of authorized but unissued preferred shares, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a
particular series by the Board of Directors.
(9) If the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall, at any time and in good faith, be of the opinion that ownership of securities of the
Corporation has or may become concentrated to an extent that may prevent the Corporation from qualifying as a real estate investment trust under the
REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (as defined below), then the Board of Directors shall have the power, by lot or other means deemed
equitable by them to prevent the transfer of and/or to call for redemption a number of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock sufficient, in the opinion of the
Board of Directors, to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership thereof into conformity with the requirements of such a real estate investment
trust under the REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The redemption price to be paid for shares of Series Y Preferred Stock so called for
redemption, on the date fixed for redemption, shall be the closing price of the shares on the principal national stock exchange on which the shares are
listed on the last business day prior to the redemption date, or if no sales of shares were made on such date, the average of the highest bid and the lowest
asked quotations on the last business day prior to the redemption date as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or a similar
organization selected from time to time by the Corporation or if there be no such bid and asked quotations, $25,000 per share; provided that if interests in
shares of Series Y Preferred Stock are represented by depositary shares, then the redemption price shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
but with respect to one depositary share, multiplied by the number of depositary shares that together represent an interest in one share of Series Y
Preferred Stock. From and after the date fixed for redemption by the Board of Directors, the holder of any shares of Series Y Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall cease to be entitled to any distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of Series Y Preferred Stock, other
than the right to payment of the redemption price determined as aforesaid. “REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code” shall mean Sections 856
through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order to exercise the redemption option set forth in this clause (9), with respect to the
shares of Series Y Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall mail a notice of redemption by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of
A-C-B-4
Table of Contents
the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to such redemption date, to the respective addresses
of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. The failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice or in
its mailing will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series Y Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was
defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the
redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that
dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock held by
any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series Y Preferred Stock to be redeemed from
such holder.
(d) Voting Rights. The shares of Series Y Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers either general or special, except as required by law,
except that:
(1) If the Corporation shall fail to pay full cumulative dividends on the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock or any other of its preferred shares
for six quarterly dividend payment periods, whether or not consecutive (a “Dividend Default”), the holders of all outstanding preferred shares that are
similarly entitled to this right, voting as a single class without regard to series, will be entitled to elect two Directors until full cumulative dividends for all
past dividend payment periods on all preferred shares have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment. Such right to vote separately
as a class to elect Directors shall, when vested, be subject, always, to the same provisions for the vesting of such right to elect Directors separately as a
class in the case of future Dividend Defaults. At any time when such right to elect Directors separately as a class shall have so vested, the Corporation
may call, and, upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than 10% of the total number of preferred shares of the Corporation then
outstanding, shall call, a special meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors. In the case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be
held within 90 days after the delivery of such request and, in either case, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the Bylaws of the
Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to call such a special meeting if such request is received less than 120 days before the
date fixed for the next ensuing Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation and the holders of all classes of outstanding preferred shares are
afforded the opportunity to elect such Directors (or fill any vacancy) at such Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Directors elected as aforesaid shall serve
until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified. If, prior to the end of
the term of any Director elected as aforesaid, a vacancy in the office of such Director shall occur during the continuance of a Dividend Default by reason
of death, resignation, or disability, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of a new Director for the unexpired term of such
former Director, such appointment to be made by the remaining Director elected as aforesaid.
(2) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series Y Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, will be required for any amendment to the Charter that will adversely alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of
the shares of Series Y Preferred Stock, except as set forth below. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Series Y Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred shares similarly entitled to this right and ranking on a parity with Series Y Preferred
Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation (including the shares of the Series X Preferred Stock and the Series Z Preferred Stock), voting as a single class
without regard to series, will be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of any class or series of shares ranking prior to Series Y
Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase
any such security. In addition, the Charter may be amended to increase the number of authorized preferred shares ranking on a parity with or junior to
Series Y Preferred Stock or to create another class of preferred shares ranking on a parity with or junior to Series Y Preferred Stock without the vote of the
holders of outstanding shares of Series Y Preferred Stock.

(3) Nothing herein shall be taken to require a class vote or consent in connection with the authorization, designation, increase or issuance
of any shares of any class or series (including additional preferred shares of any series) that rank junior to or on a parity with Series Y Preferred Stock as
to dividends or liquidation rights or in connection with the authorization, designation, increase or issuance of any bonds, mortgages, debentures or other
debt obligations of the Corporation.

Corporation.

Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series X (the “Series X Preferred Stock”), and 5.20% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Y (the “Series Y Preferred
Stock”)), all dividends declared upon shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred shares ranking on a parity therewith as to
dividends shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and such other series of
preferred shares shall in all cases bear to each other that same ratio that the accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock
and such other series of preferred shares bear to each other. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, unless full cumulative dividends on the shares
of Series Z Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment for all past Dividend Periods, no dividends (other than in
shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.01 per share (together with any other shares of capital stock of the Corporation into which such
shares shall be reclassified or changed, the “Common Shares”), or another stock ranking junior to the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock as to dividends
and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be made upon the Common Shares or on any
other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation. Unless full
cumulative dividends on the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment for all past Dividend
Periods, no Common Shares or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for
a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation or any subsidiary, except by conversion into or exchange for stock
of the Corporation ranking junior to the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation.
(b) Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of
Series Z Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to shareholders, before any distribution of
assets is made to holders of Common Shares or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock upon
liquidation, liquidating distributions in the amount of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) for
the then current and all past Dividend Periods. If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation the
amounts payable with respect to the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Corporation ranking as to any such distribution on a
parity with the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and of such other shares (including
the shares of the Series X Preferred Stock and the Series Y Preferred Stock) will share ratably in any such distribution of assets of the Corporation in
proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which
they are entitled, the holders of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the
Corporation.
(1) Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the
place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than
30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock at the respective
addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.

(2) For purposes of liquidation rights, a reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or
corporations or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation.
(c)
Redemption.
(1) Except as provided in clause (9) below, the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are not redeemable prior to November 4, 2024. On and after
such date, the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are redeemable at the option of the Corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors, in whole or in
part, from time to time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a cash redemption price of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to the date of redemption.
(2) If fewer than all the outstanding shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed will be
determined by the Board of Directors, and such shares shall be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number
of such shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares) or by lot in a manner determined by the Board of
Directors.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any dividends, including any accumulation, on the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are in arrears, no
shares of Series Z Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the
Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series Z Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer provided such offer is made
on the same terms to all holders of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock.
(4) Immediately prior to any redemption of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and
unpaid dividends through the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls after a dividend payment record date and prior to the corresponding
dividend payment date, in which case each holder of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock at the close of business on such dividend payment record date
shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares
before such dividend payment date. Except as expressly provided herein above, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid
dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of Series Z Preferred Stock called for redemption.
(5) A notice of redemption (which may be contingent on the occurrence of a future event) will be mailed by the Corporation by first class
mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to
such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. The failure
to give such notice or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series Z Preferred
Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of
Series Z Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all
the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of
Series Z Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.
(6) In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of the shares to be redeemed, such record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption.

Table of Contents
(7) Notice having been given as provided above, from and after the date fixed for the redemption of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock by
the Corporation (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available the money necessary to effect such redemption), the holders of shares selected for
redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation by virtue thereof and
shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the moneys payable upon such redemption from the
Corporation, less any required tax withholding amount, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement or assignment of transfer, if required
by the Corporation and so stated in the notice) of their certificates, and the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. If
fewer than all the shares represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued, without cost to the holder thereof, representing the
unredeemed shares. The Corporation may, at its option, at any time after a notice of redemption has been given, deposit the redemption price for the
shares of Series Z Preferred Stock designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed
for redemption, with the transfer agent or agents for Series Z Preferred Stock, as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series Z
Preferred Stock designated for redemption, together with irrevocable instructions and authority to such transfer agent or agents that such funds be
delivered upon redemption of such shares and to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the redemption price of the shares to
their respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the making of such deposit, the holders of the shares designated for
redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation by virtue thereof and
shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive from such trust fund the moneys payable upon such
redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement, if required by the Corporation) of their certificates, and the shares represented
thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. Any balance of such moneys remaining unclaimed at the end of the five-year period commencing
on the date fixed for redemption shall be repaid to the Corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.
(8) Any shares of Series Z Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed or otherwise reacquired shall, after such redemption,
have the status of authorized but unissued preferred shares, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a
particular series by the Board of Directors.
(9) If the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall, at any time and in good faith, be of the opinion that ownership of securities of the
Corporation has or may become concentrated to an extent that may prevent the Corporation from qualifying as a real estate investment trust under the
REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (as defined below), then the Board of Directors shall have the power, by lot or other means deemed
equitable by them to prevent the transfer of and/or to call for redemption a number of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock sufficient, in the opinion of the
Board of Directors, to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership thereof into conformity with the requirements of such a real estate investment
trust under the REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The redemption price to be paid for shares of Series Z Preferred Stock so called for
redemption, on the date fixed for redemption, shall be the closing price of the shares on the principal national stock exchange on which the shares are
listed on the last business day prior to the redemption date, or if no sales of shares were made on such date, the average of the highest bid and the lowest
asked quotations on the last business day prior to the redemption date as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or a similar
organization selected from time to time by the Corporation or if there be no such bid and asked quotations, $25,000 per share; provided that if interests in
shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are represented by depositary shares, then the redemption price shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
but with respect to one depositary share, multiplied by the number of depositary shares that together represent an interest in one share of Series Z
Preferred Stock. From and after the date fixed for redemption by the Board of Directors, the holder of any shares of Series Z Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall cease to be entitled to any distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, other
than the right to payment of the redemption price determined as aforesaid. “REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code” shall mean Sections 856
through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order to exercise the
A-C-C-4
Table of Contents
redemption option set forth in this clause (9), with respect to the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall mail a notice of redemption by
first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. The
failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice or in its mailing will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series Z
Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of
shares of Series Z Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date.
If fewer than all the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the
number of shares of Series Z Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.
(d) Voting Rights. The shares of Series Z Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers either general or special, except as required by law,
except that:
(1) If the Corporation shall fail to pay full cumulative dividends on the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock or any other of its preferred shares
for six quarterly dividend payment periods, whether or not consecutive (a “Dividend Default”), the holders of all outstanding preferred shares that are
similarly entitled to this right, voting as a single class without regard to series, will be entitled to elect two Directors until full cumulative dividends for all
past dividend payment periods on all preferred shares have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment. Such right to vote separately
as a class to elect Directors shall, when vested, be subject, always, to the same provisions for the vesting of such right to elect Directors separately as a
class in the case of future Dividend Defaults. At any time when such right to elect Directors separately as a class shall have so vested, the Corporation
may call, and, upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than 10% of the total number of preferred shares of the Corporation then
outstanding, shall call, a special meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors. In the case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be
held within 90 days after the delivery of such request and, in either case, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the Bylaws of the
Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to call such a special meeting if such request is received less than 120 days before the
date fixed for the next ensuing Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation and the holders of all classes of outstanding preferred shares are
afforded the opportunity to elect such Directors (or fill any vacancy) at such Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Directors elected as aforesaid shall serve
until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified. If, prior to the end of
the term of any Director elected as aforesaid, a vacancy in the office of such Director shall occur during the continuance of a Dividend Default by reason
of death, resignation, or disability, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of a new Director for the unexpired term of such
former Director, such appointment to be made by the remaining Director elected as aforesaid.
(2) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, will be required for any amendment to the Charter that will adversely alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of
the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, except as set forth below. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred shares similarly entitled to this right and ranking on a parity with Series Z Preferred
Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation (including the shares of the Series X Preferred Stock and the Series Y Preferred Stock), voting as a single class
without regard to series, will be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of any class or series of shares ranking prior to Series Z
Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase
any such security. In addition, the Charter may be amended to increase the number of authorized preferred shares ranking on a parity with or junior to
Series Z Preferred Stock or to create another class of preferred shares ranking on a parity with or junior to Series Z Preferred Stock without the vote of the
holders of outstanding shares of Series Z Preferred Stock.

(3) Nothing herein shall be taken to require a class vote or consent in connection with the authorization, designation, increase or issuance
of any shares of any class or series (including additional preferred shares of any series) that rank junior to or on a parity with Series Z Preferred Stock as
to dividends or liquidation rights or in connection with the authorization, designation, increase or issuance of any bonds, mortgages, debentures or other
debt obligations of the Corporation.
(e) Conversion. The shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are not convertible into shares of any other class or series of the capital stock of the
Corporation.
