ENT stockholder who properly demands appraisal for such dissenting shares) will be cancelled and retired, and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $28.25 in cash (the “Per Share Merger

longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights may
have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding,
as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned

Each share of Company Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration
multiplied by a factor of 1,000 (the “Preferred Stock Merger Consideration”).
At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (the “Merger Consideration”) with a designated

Intersect ENT’s 2014 Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) after August 6, 2021, any
outstanding offering period will end no later than five days before the Effective Time, and the ESPP will terminate as

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by Intersect ENT stockholders in exchange for shares of
Intersect ENT common stock in the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for Intersect ENT stockholders who
are U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption, “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”). Such receipt of cash by each of our stockholders who is a U.S. Holder generally will result in the
recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash that such U.S.
Holder receives in the Merger per share and (2) such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock
surrendered in the Merger by such stockholder.
Intersect ENT stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Intersect ENT stockholders, including stockholders who are not U.S. Holders, should also consult their own tax
advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal estate, gift and other non-income tax laws or the laws
of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.
Appraisal Rights",11,11

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Intersect ENT stockholders who continuously hold
shares of Intersect ENT common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the
Merger under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”). This means that
Intersect ENT stockholders may be entitled to have their shares of Intersect ENT common stock appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Intersect ENT
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, as
described further below. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Intersect ENT stockholders who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.
Intersect ENT stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Intersect ENT common stock.
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
To exercise appraisal rights, Intersect ENT stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Intersect
ENT before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise
vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold shares of Intersect ENT common
stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal
rights under the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of
Intersect ENT unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Intersect ENT stockholders seeking
appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy
statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding
appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold
your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you
should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a
demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Appraisal Rights.”

The Intersect ENT Board, after considering various factors described under the caption, “The Merger-
Recommendation of the Intersect ENT Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously: (i) determined that the
Merger and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of Intersect ENT and its stockholders, (ii) approved
and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting; and (iv) subject to the
other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend, on behalf of Intersect ENT, that all
Intersect ENT stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL.
Accordingly, the Intersect ENT Board also unanimously recommends, on behalf of Intersect ENT, that Intersect ENT
stockholders vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3)
“FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Intersect ENT
Board may withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation if it determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would violate the Intersect ENT Board’s
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law. However, the Intersect ENT Board cannot withdraw or change
the foregoing recommendation unless it complies with certain procedures in the
5TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a five-calendar day period
so that a failure to make an Intersect ENT Board Recommendation Change (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The Intersect ENT Board’s Recommendation;
Intersect ENT Board Recommendation Change”) would no longer violate the Intersect ENT Board’s fiduciary duties
to stockholders under applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by Parent following the withdrawal
by the Board of Directors of its recommendation that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement will result in the
payment by Intersect ENT of a termination fee to Parent in the amount of $29.25 million. For more information, please

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the Intersect ENT Board that, as of August 5,
2021 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.25 in cash per share of
Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding
shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to
such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 5, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance

Pursuant to an engagement letter between Intersect ENT and Goldman Sachs, Intersect ENT has agreed to pay
Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $18 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the

Agreement and the Merger and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the

negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) (ii) provide any

paragraph) if (and only if) the Intersect ENT Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and, in each case, the failure to act in respect of such Acquisition
Proposal would reasonably be expected to violate the Intersect ENT Board’s fiduciary duties to stockholders under
applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption

After the Agreement Date but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Intersect ENT stockholders,

stockholders, Intersect ENT must pay a termination fee of $29.25 million to Parent. For more information, please see

Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-7348, against Intersect ENT and current members of the Intersect ENT Board (the “Wang
Complaint”). The Wang Complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks,
among other things, an injunction preventing consummation of the proposed transaction with Medtronic, rescission
of the proposed transaction or rescissory damages in the event it is consummated, an accounting by the defendants
for all damages caused to the plaintiff, and the award of attorneys' fees and expenses. Intersect ENT and the current
members of the Intersect ENT Board have not been served with the Wang Complaint. Defendants believe the claims
asserted in these complaints are without merit, deny any wrongdoing in connection with the filing of the Preliminary
Proxy Statement, and intend to vigorously defend against the claims.

Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important
to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all
of the documents we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other
things, the Merger and how it affects you. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement without charge by following the instructions under the caption, “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
The Intersect ENT Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of
common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will take place virtually on October 8, 2021, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific time. The Special Meeting
can be accessed by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/XENT2021SM, where you will be able to listen
to the meeting live and vote online.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Intersect ENT, and
Intersect ENT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
•
to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special
Meeting. Each holder of common stock shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on each matter properly brought
before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of business on the Record Date. If you are a
beneficial owner, you will need to contact the broker, bank or other nominee who is the stockholder of record
with respect to your shares to obtain your Control Number prior to the Special Meeting.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting virtually and vote in person?
A:
Yes. All stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you do not need to do anything in advance to attend and/or
vote your shares at the Special Meeting, but to be admitted to the Special Meeting you will need to visit
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/XENT2021SM and enter the 16-digit Control Number found next to the
label “Control Number” on your proxy card voting instruction form, or in the email sending you the Proxy
Statement. If you are a beneficial owner, you will need to contact the broker, bank or other nominee who is the
stockholder of record with respect to your shares to obtain your Control Number prior to the Special Meeting.
We encourage you to access the Special Meeting before it begins. Online check-in will start approximately 15
minutes before the Special Meeting is scheduled to begin at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time on October 8, 2021.
Each holder of record of common stock shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on each matter properly brought
before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
9TABLE OF CONTENTS
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting online, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the
Special Meeting we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and vote online, your vote
will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other
nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your
shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration of $28.25 in
cash, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that
you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For
example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $2,825.00 in cash in exchange for your shares
of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Intersect ENT’s common stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (1) submit a signed
proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card); or (3) vote online at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at
the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at
the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Intersect ENT will remain
an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and
registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, Intersect ENT will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $29.25 million
upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fee.”
Q:
Why are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Intersect ENT to seek an advisory (non-binding)
vote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present online or represented
by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of the
Compensation Proposal.
10
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Intersect ENT. Therefore, if
the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under
the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Intersect ENT’s named executive officers in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q:
What is a “broker non-vote”?
A:
Under the rules of Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for
customers have the authority to vote on “discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions
from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their
voting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies to
approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial
owner of such shares of Intersect ENT common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not
empowered to vote those shares of Intersect ENT common stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to
generally as “broker non-votes.” Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are
routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Intersect ENT does not expect any
broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects
you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided
in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and
written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of common stock represented by such holder’s book-
entry shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before
the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Intersect ENT in writing of
such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger consideration, if the
Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to
vote those shares at the Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of
common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,
you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Intersect ENT.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by
your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of
record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.
However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares online at the Special
Meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting and voting online.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting
electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will
be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting online, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of
common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you
beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock online at the Special Meeting even if you
have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote online, your previous vote
by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the
Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee,
you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
12
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Intersect ENT; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting online.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote online at the Special Meeting if
you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.”
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting. Meeting if you obtain
a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR”, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR”
the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
If available, Intersect ENT may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting.
Intersect ENT intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC
within four business days following the Special Meeting. All reports that Intersect ENT files with the SEC are
publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the
Merger in Spring of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because
the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of
our control.

This proxy statement, and any documents to which Intersect ENT refers to in this proxy statement, contains not only
historical information, but also forward-looking statements, including all statements relating directly or indirectly to
the timing or likelihood of completing the Merger, litigation and other information with respect to our plans and
strategies, made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These

including but not limited to the expected completion and timing of the proposed transaction, expected benefits and
costs of the proposed transaction, management plans and other information relating to the proposed transaction,
strategies and objectives of Intersect ENT for future operations and other information relating to the proposed

factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:
•
the ability of the parties to consummate the proposed Merger, satisfaction of closing conditions precedent
to the consummation of the proposed Merger, potential delays in consummating the Merger, the ability of
Intersect ENT to timely and successfully achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger and the impact of
health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on the parties’ respective businesses and the actions
the parties may take in response thereto;
•
the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances that require us to pay
Parent a termination fee of $29,250,000;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the Merger
Agreement;
•
risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key
employees;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to stockholders that are treated
as U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that, if the Merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential
long-term value of the successful execution of Intersect ENT’s current strategy as an independent public
company;
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT is unable to solicit other Acquisition
Proposals during the Pre-Closing Period;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results
and business generally;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
•
risks related to the Merger diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business
operations;
•
risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed; and
•
risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the Merger, including the timing and receipt of
regulatory approvals from various governmental entities, including any conditions, limitations or
restrictions placed on these approvals, and the risk that one or more governmental entities may deny
approval.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the
information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including: (i) the information contained under this

statements.
In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the date they were made and should
not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. Except as required by applicable law, we

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the

executive offices located at 1555 Adams Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025, during regular business hours for a

The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present online or

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Intersect ENT’s common stock that are issued and
outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the
Record Date, 16,710,122 votes constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock.
Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present online or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve, on an advisory (non-

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present online or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder
abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
Compensation Proposal. For stockholders who attend the virtual meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain
from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to
adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies to
approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement
at the time of the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted
for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will also count as votes against such proposal.

Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies to approve the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on
your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting
instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares. “Broker non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However, because none of the proposals to be voted on at the
Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Intersect ENT does
not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As such, if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted towards a quorum at the Special Meeting.

"Intersect ENT, Inc._20210907_DEFM14A_19520364_4290965.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Intersect ENT Board frequently reviews, with Intersect ENT senior management, and with the assistance of its
outside advisors, Intersect ENT’s strategic and financial alternatives in light of developments in Intersect ENT’s
business, the sectors in which it competes, the economy generally and financial markets. Over the past eighteen (18)
months, this assessment has also been informed by perceptions of the current and prospective impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic. As part of this process, members of Intersect ENT senior management have engaged in business
development and strategic discussions with participants in the medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare
equipment industries, all with the goal of enhancing value for stockholders and delivering the best possible
treatments and services to patients and healthcare providers. Intersect ENT’s strategic discussions have also
focused on, among other things, collaborations with other medical device companies.
On June 22, 2020, Mr. Thomas A. West, Chief Executive Officer of Intersect ENT, received a telephone call from Mr.
Chris Cleary, Vice President of Corporate Development at Medtronic, noting that Medtronic planned to send a letter
proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for a purchase price of $17.50 per share in cash.
Later that day, Medtronic provided the proposal letter via email. Mr. West acknowledged receipt of the acquisition
proposal letter via email. Mr. West promptly notified the Intersect ENT Board of the acquisition proposal letter. On
June 22, 2020, shares of Intersect ENT common stock closed on Nasdaq at $12.60 per share.
On June 25, 2020 the Intersect ENT Board convened via teleconference. At that time, the Intersect ENT Board agreed
to establish the Intersect ENT Transaction Advisory Committee to guide the interactions between Intersect ENT, its
advisors and Medtronic and to preview any recommendations or proposals prior to full
22TABLE OF CONTENTS
Intersect ENT Board review. The Transaction Advisory Committee was comprised of the following Intersect ENT
Board members: Kieran Gallahue, Dana Mead and Cindy Lucchese, each of whom are independent directors and were
chosen based on their experience with strategic transactions, existing roles on our Intersect ENT Board and
willingness to serve on the Transaction Advisory Committee. In addition, the Intersect ENT Board agreed to engage
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as financial advisor to Intersect ENT (“Goldman Sachs”) and Cooley LLP as Intersect
ENT’s outside legal counsel (“Cooley”) for the purpose of assisting the Intersect ENT Board in evaluating the
acquisition proposal letter. Over the course of the next few weeks, Intersect ENT senior management, Intersect ENT’s
advisors and the Transaction Advisory Committee worked to develop their analyses of the proposed acquisition and
of Intersect ENT’s various alternatives thereto in order to present their analyses to the full Intersect ENT Board and
respond to the Medtronic offer.
On July 7, 2020, Intersect ENT’s Transaction Advisory Committee held a meeting via teleconference where members
of Intersect ENT senior management and Goldman Sachs, relying on certain financial projections prepared by
Intersect ENT senior management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use, presented a valuation model and analysis
of the proposed acquisition to Intersect ENT’s Transaction Advisory Committee. Later in the afternoon, after the
close of the U.S. financial markets, a Bloomberg article reported that Medtronic had made an offer to acquire Intersect
ENT. On July 7, 2020, shares of Intersect ENT common stock closed on Nasdaq at $13.89 per share.
On the morning of July 8, 2020, the Intersect ENT Board held a telephonic meeting with members of Intersect ENT
senior management, representatives from Goldman Sachs, and representatives from Cooley in attendance. At the
meeting, the Intersect ENT Board discussed the acquisition proposal and determined that the proposed purchase
price of $17.50 per share was insufficient to enter into a transaction. The Intersect ENT Board directed the Intersect
ENT senior management team to convey this message to Medtronic.
On July 9, 2020, Mr. West contacted Mr. Cleary by telephone and indicated that Medtronic’s proposed purchase price
was insufficient to enter into a transaction with Medtronic.
On July 9, 2020, Company A, a competitor in the medical device industry, contacted Mr. West to set up a call for the
following day.
On July 10, 2020, Mr. West held a telephonic meeting with a representative of Company A. At the meeting, the
representative of Company A noted that they were not planning to make an acquisition proposal, but would like to be
included in the process if Intersect ENT decided to engage in a full strategic transaction process.
On July 13, 2020, Medtronic sent Mr. West a revised acquisition proposal letter with a purchase price of $18.50 per
share.
On July 14, 2020, Mr. West and Mr. Cleary spoke by telephone, Mr. West confirmed receipt of the revised offer and
noted that he would review the offer with the Intersect ENT Board for consideration the following day.
On July 15, 2020, the Intersect ENT Board met with the Intersect ENT senior management team and Intersect ENT’s
advisors to discuss the revised offer. After a thorough review of certain financial projections prepared by Intersect
ENT senior management, the operating risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, Goldman Sachs’ financial analysis
and valuation based on these projections and feedback and advice from Cooley, the Intersect ENT Board determined
that an offer in the “mid-twenties” would be necessary to proceed and that Mr. West should convey this price target
to Medtronic. The Intersect ENT Board indicated that the Intersect ENT senior management team should also deliver
a management presentation in order to provide Medtronic with a detailed understanding of Intersect ENT and a high-
level, preliminary view of potential synergies with Medtronic.
On July 16, 2020, Mr. West spoke to Mr. Cleary, noting that Intersect ENT would consider a transaction where
Intersect ENT would be acquired for a purchase price in the mid-20s per share. Mr. Cleary noted that he would
consider the proposal.
On July 21, 2020, Mr. Cleary contacted Mr. West and both agreed that a management presentation might provide the
basis for Medtronic seeing increased value for its bid to meet Intersect ENT’s valuation expectations.
On July 28, 2020, Mr. West spoke to Mr. Cleary and finalized the details for the agreed management presentation to
further Medtronic’s understanding of Intersect ENT, subject to entering into a confidentiality agreement, which
would provide for, among other terms, a standstill obligation for a minimum period of six months. Mr. Cleary accepted.
Later that day, Intersect ENT and Medtronic executed a confidentiality agreement,
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which included customary terms and a standstill provision for a six-month period. The standstill provision included
customary exclusions such as permitting parties to approach Intersect ENT privately and confidentially and a fall
away provision upon the entry or public announcement of certain acquisition transactions.
On July 29, 2020, members of Intersect ENT senior management held a management presentation for Medtronic.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs were also in attendance.
Following the completion of the management presentation, Intersect ENT reached out to Medtronic to determine if
any additional questions or data requests would be forthcoming. Medtronic indicated in August 2020 that the
management presentation had not materially changed its view on valuation. At this time, Intersect ENT was actively
engaged in pursuing an acquisition of Fiagon AG. Fiagon AG had been considered as a potential distribution partner
of Intersect ENT prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and consideration of potential strategic options
were restarted over the course of the summer of 2020. This led to additional Intersect ENT Board meetings to discuss
the timing of moving forward with a potential acquisition of Fiagon AG and whether or not to reach out to Medtronic
for a further indication of interest. Because Medtronic had reported that the management presentation had not
materially changed its view on valuation, the Intersect ENT Board resolved to pursue the acquisition of Fiagon AG
and instructed the Intersect ENT senior management team to proceed on that basis.
On September 15, 2020, Intersect ENT’s acquisition of Fiagon AG was announced before the U.S. financial markets
opened.
Following the announcement of the acquisition of Fiagon AG, there were periodic, high-level conversations between
Intersect ENT and Medtronic. These conversations did not lead to further discussions regarding potential
transaction terms, and Intersect ENT did not engage further with Medtronic during the remainder of 2020 or the first
half of 2021.
On July 7, 2021, Mr. Cleary reached out to Intersect ENT seeking to speak with Mr. West.
On July 8, 2021, Medtronic sent a letter proposing to acquire Intersect ENT at purchase price of $24.00 per share in
cash to Mr. Kieran Gallahue, Chairman of the Intersect ENT Board, as Mr. West was not immediately available. Later
the same day, Mr. West spoke with Mr. Richard Meier, the chief financial officer of Intersect ENT, to discuss the
written proposal from Medtronic.
On the morning of July 10, 2021, the Intersect ENT Board held a telephone conference call to discuss Medtronic’s
revised offer of $24.00 per share in cash. Members of Intersect ENT senior management, representatives from
Goldman Sachs, and representatives from Cooley were in attendance.
On July 13, 2021, the Intersect ENT senior management team reviewed in greater detail with the Intersect ENT Board
the Medtronic offer at $24.00 per share, as well as the additional financial implications of this offer. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Cooley were also in attendance. At such meeting, the Intersect ENT Board noted that while the
offer at $24.00 per share was potentially attractive based on a thorough review of certain financial projections, the
operating risks relating to COVID-19 pandemic, Goldman Sachs’ financial analysis and valuation based on the
projections and feedback and advice from Cooley, the offer would need to be in the high-20s per share in order for
Intersect ENT to consider entering into a transaction. In particular, it was noted that the position of Intersect ENT
had materially improved over the course of the last year with the demonstrated recovery of PROPEL despite ongoing
the COVID-19 pandemic challenges, the office-based business for both PROPEL and SINUVA had expanded and the
addition of Fiagon navigation and balloon products had taken place. Later that day, Mr. West spoke to Mr. Cleary
noting that the Intersect ENT Board would consider an offer in the high-20s per share if such a transaction could be
consummated in a prompt manner.
On July 19, 2021, Intersect ENT and Medtronic entered into an amendment to the original confidentiality agreement
previously entered into on July 28, 2020. The confidentiality agreement included a Medtronic six-month standstill
period. Later that day, Intersect ENT began populating and opened a virtual data room.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 20, 2021, members of Intersect ENT senior management held a management presentation for Medtronic
employees across a range of functions. That same day, Intersect ENT and Medtronic executed a confidentiality
agreement for certain highly confidential information relating to Intersect ENT. The Intersect ENT senior management
team met with the Intersect ENT Board on a teleconference later in the day to de-brief the Intersect ENT Board on the
management presentation.
On July 21, 2021, Mr. West received a telephone call from Mr. Cleary at Medtronic revising the proposal to $27.00 per
share. Later that evening, Mr. West and members of Intersect ENT senior management met with the Transaction
Advisory Committee previously established by the Intersect ENT Board to report on the improved Medtronic offer of
$27.00 per share in cash. The Transaction Advisory Committee and Mr. West agreed to seek $29.50 per share in cash
in order to maximize the potential value to Intersect ENT stockholders but to also indicate to Medtronic that a price
below $30.00 would be considered. Later that day, Mr. West conveyed to Mr. Cleary the specific price target of $29.50
per share. Mr. Cleary indicated that $29.50 per share did not constitute any material movement on Intersect ENT’s
part, despite Medtronic’s improved offer from $24.00 per share to $27.00 per share, and that Medtronic expected a
compromise valuation in order to come to an agreement.
On July 23, 2021, Mr. Cleary called Mr. West and increased Medtronic’s bid from $27.00 per share in cash to $28.25 per
share in cash. A telephonic meeting of the Intersect ENT Board was convened for later that day. The Intersect ENT
Board, members of Intersect ENT senior management and representatives from Goldman Sachs and Cooley met to
discuss the latest offer. The Intersect ENT Board authorized Mr. West to negotiate towards a price of $28.50 per share
in cash. However, they noted that Mr. West could accept $28.25 per share in cash. Mr. West contacted Mr. Cleary to
request an increased offer of $28.50 per share. Mr. Cleary agreed to take the counter offer back to Medtronic
management. Mr. Cleary subsequently called Mr. West indicating that there could be no further movement beyond
$28.25 per share. Mr. West accepted $28.25 per share as the final offer, noting that he expected Medtronic to conclude
its diligence within an agreed time frame and in the ordinary course for public company transactions. Mr. West
communicated the outcome of the negotiation and the agreement for $28.25 per share to the Intersect ENT Board.
That same day, Intersect ENT granted data room access to Medtronic and its legal advisors.
On July 27, 2021 and July 28, 2021, a team from Medtronic visited Intersect ENT’s Menlo Park, California facility for
the purposes of conducting onsite due diligence. The focus of diligence was on operations, quality, regulatory and
product innovation. Members of Intersect ENT senior management were also in attendance throughout.
On July 27, 2021, Ropes & Gray LLP, Medtronic’s outside legal counsel (“Ropes”), sent an initial draft of the Merger
Agreement to Cooley. The initial draft of the Merger Agreement proposed, among other things, an Intersect ENT
termination fee of 3.75% of the transaction value and a Medtronic termination fee of 3.75% of the transaction value.
On August 1, 2021, Cooley sent Ropes a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed, among other
things, an Intersect ENT termination fee of 2.5% of the transaction value and a Medtronic termination fee equal to the
greater of (i) the aggregate amount outstanding under the unsecured loan to be entered into during the pre-closing
period between Intersect ENT and Medtronic and (ii) 10% of the transaction value. Cooley also sent Ropes an initial
draft of the financing term sheet, which included an interest rate of 3.25% and did not include a cap on amounts
Intersect ENT could borrow.
On August 2, 2021, Ropes sent Cooley a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed, among other
things, an Intersect ENT termination fee of 3.5% of the transaction value and removed the proposed Medtronic
termination fee. That same day, Ropes sent Cooley a revised draft of the financing term sheet, which included a cap
on the amounts Intersect ENT could borrow under the unsecured loan, ranging from $75-$90 million, and an interest
rate of 7.5%. The parties continued to negotiate the term sheet until August 5, 2021, ultimately agreeing to a cap of
$75 million under the unsecured loan and an interest rate of 5%.
On August 2, 2021, representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered a relationship disclosure letter to the Intersect ENT
senior management team who provided it to the Intersect ENT Board, providing information regarding certain of
Goldman Sachs’ relationships with certain affiliates of Medtronic, which the Intersect ENT Board did not believe
would adversely affect Goldman Sachs’ independence.
25
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 3, 2021, Cooley sent Ropes the initial draft of the disclosure schedules, which the parties continued to
revise and negotiate until immediately prior to signing the Merger Agreement.
On August 3, 2021, Intersect ENT entered into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs, whereby Goldman Sachs
would act as the exclusive financial advisor in connection with the possible sale of Intersect ENT and undertake a
study to enable Goldman Sachs to render an opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the financial
consideration to be paid to stockholders of Intersect ENT in connection with the sale of the shares of its outstanding
common stock.
On August 4, 2021, Cooley sent Ropes a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which draft proposed, among other
things, an Intersect ENT termination fee of 2.65% of the transaction value and a proposed Medtronic termination fee
in the form of forgiveness of the unsecured loan. Later that day, Ropes returned the draft Merger Agreement to
Cooley, which draft proposed among other things a 2.8% Intersect ENT termination fee and a cap on the amount of
the Medtronic termination fee not to exceed $75 million.
On August 5, 2021, Cooley and Ropes exchanged further drafts of the Merger Agreement.
On that same day, the Intersect ENT Board held a videoconference with representatives of Intersect ENT senior
management, Cooley and Goldman Sachs, to consider the definitive deal documents, including the Merger
Agreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs orally rendered its opinion to the Intersect ENT Board, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the effect that, as of August 5, 2021 and based upon and subject to
various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such opinion, the $28.25 in cash per
share to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
shares of Intersect ENT common stock, in their capacity as such holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates), was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates). For more information
about Goldman Sachs’ opinion, see below under the caption “The Merger-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”.
Following that delivery, representatives of Cooley provided a review for the Intersect ENT Board of its fiduciary
duties and reviewed certain material terms of the proposed final Merger Agreement, including (i) key closing
conditions such as antitrust approval and a detailed discussion relating to the potential antitrust risks involved with
the transaction, (ii) restrictions on Intersect ENT’s ability to operate its business between sign and close, (iii) the
treatment of equity awards, (iv) a “no-shop” restriction requiring Intersect ENT to cease all third-party negotiations
or discussions and prohibiting Intersect ENT from further soliciting other acquisition proposals (subject to a
fiduciary out for a superior proposal), (v) the interim loan facility for up to $75 million with an interest rate of 5% per
annum, (vi) the 2.8% termination fee to be paid by Intersect ENT if the agreement is terminated due to the acceptance
of a superior proposal, a Intersect ENT Board recommendation change or in the event of termination under certain
other circumstances if Intersect ENT entered into an alternative agreement within one year thereafter, and (vii) the
termination fee payable by Medtronic in an amount equal to the amount of the interim term loan outstanding if the
transaction failed due to antitrust reasons. Representatives of Cooley answered questions from members of the
Intersect ENT Board regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. After the presentation by Cooley, the Intersect
ENT Board continued to discuss the potential transaction with Medtronic, Intersect ENT’s various alternatives
thereto and the reasons that the Intersect ENT Board believed that the proposed Merger with Medtronic, Merger
Agreement and other transactions contemplated thereby, were advisable and in the best interests of Intersect ENT
and its stockholders. For more information concerning the recommendation of the Intersect ENT Board, see the
section titled “The Merger Agreement-Reasons for the Merger.” Following such discussion, the Intersect ENT Board
unanimously determined that the Merger, Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby were
advisable and in the best interests of Intersect ENT and its stockholders, and authorized Intersect ENT senior
management to execute the final Merger Agreement and related definitive documents with Medtronic.
On August 6, 2021, Intersect ENT and Medtronic executed the Merger Agreement.
The same day, and prior to the opening of the U.S. stock markets and the announcement of Intersect ENT’s second
quarter earnings release, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement,
which Intersect ENT filed later that morning with a Current Report on Form 8-K.

Recommendation of the Intersect ENT Board
The Intersect ENT Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger and the Transactions are fair to and in the
best interests of Intersect ENT and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger
Agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
Company at the Special Meeting; and (iv) subject to the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
resolved to recommend, on behalf of Intersect ENT, that all Intersect ENT stockholders to approve the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.
The Intersect ENT Board unanimously recommends, on behalf of Intersect ENT, that you vote: (1) “FOR” the
adoption the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR”, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
(3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
The Intersect ENT Board considered the following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance),
all of which it viewed as generally supporting its decision:
•
the Per Share Merger Consideration of $28.25 in cash and the current and historical trading price of
Intersect ENT’s common stock, including that the Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium
of:
•
approximately 45.1% to the 30-day volume weighted average price of Intersect ENT common stock of
$19.46, ending on July 30, 2021; and
•
approximately 15.2% to $24.52, the closing price of Intersect ENT’s common stock on August 5, 2021,
the last full trading day prior to public announcement of Intersect ENT’s entry into the Merger
Agreement;
•
the belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration represented the highest price that Medtronic was willing
to pay (see above under the caption “The Merger-Background of the Merger”), and the highest price per
share value reasonably obtainable as of the date of the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that, during the course of negotiations with Medtronic (see above under the caption “The Merger-
Background of the Merger”), Medtronic increased the price per share to be paid to Intersect ENT’s
stockholders from $24.00 per share on July 8, 2021 to $28.25 per share by July 23, 2021, a 17.7% premium to
the initial offer from Medtronic;
•
the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Medtronic in the event Intersect ENT continued
trying to obtain any additional offers at higher prices;
•
the fact that the all-cash Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid by Medtronic provides Intersect ENT
stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares upon the completion of the Merger and
does not expose them to any subsequent risks related to the business or the financial markets generally, as
compared to a transaction in which Intersect ENT stockholders receive shares or other securities, or as
compared to Intersect ENT remaining independent;
•
the Intersect ENT Board’s views of the potential rewards, risks and uncertainties inherent in Intersect
ENT’s business, including risks associated with management’s standalone plan, Intersect ENT’s financial
performance, market conditions (including the ongoing risks and uncertainties around COVID-19 and
related variants on return to work and day-to-day operations of Intersect ENT) and changing competitive
dynamics;
•
the belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration is more favorable to stockholders than the potential
value that would reasonably be expected to result from other strategic and financial alternatives available to
Intersect ENT, which could include: (i) the continuation of Intersect ENT’s business plan as an
independent enterprise, as assessed based on its historical results of operations, financial prospects and
condition; and (ii) modifications to Intersect ENT’s business and operations strategy;
27TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the belief that the aforementioned other alternatives were not reasonably likely to create greater value for
Intersect ENT’s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account, among other variables, execution risks
as well as operational, competitive, regulatory, industry and market risks, particularly those in the
healthcare industry more generally;
•
the fact that Medtronic has sufficient financial resources to fund the aggregate purchase price, payments
required to holders of the 4.0% unsecured senior convertible notes issued pursuant to the Deerfield
Convertible Facility Agreement (as defined below) (the “Deerfield Convertible Notes”) arising as a result of
the Merger, the unsecured subordinated loan facility contemplated by the Merger Agreement and fees and
expenses required to be paid at the Closing of the Merger;
•
the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 5,
2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations, and other matters set
forth in such written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than
Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully described below
under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,”
the full text of which written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
•
the likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger will be
completed, particularly in light of certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including:
•
the commitment of Medtronic in the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to complete
the Merger, including its commitment to negotiate, agree to and consummate the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of the Fiagon Business, irrespective of economic consequences, as
promptly as practicable and in any event such that such sale, divestiture, license or other disposition
may be consummated in advance of the End Date (subject to certain limitations described in the
Merger Agreement, as described below under the caption “The Merger Agreement-Antitrust
Actions”);
•
the fact that the aggregate amounts outstanding under the unsecured subordinated loans provided by
Medtronic pursuant to the Merger Agreement (i.e., an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million
to be funded, at the option of Intersect ENT, in five tranches of $15 million per fiscal quarter) plus all
accrued and unpaid interest thereunder shall no longer be due and payable to Medtronic if the Merger
Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to the failure of Medtronic to obtain
requisite regulatory clearance or a breach by Medtronic of certain regulatory covenants (subject to a
cure period);
•
the fact that Medtronic’s obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon, nor limited by,
the receipt of third-party debt financing or the completion of any marketing period;
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are customary in number and
scope, and which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Intersect ENT’s
representations and warranties, are generally subject to a “Material Adverse Effect” qualification (see
below under the caption “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” for more
information); and
•
Intersect ENT’s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement;
•
the terms of the Merger Agreement permitting Intersect ENT to respond to unsolicited alternative
proposals and the related terms of the Merger Agreement, including:
•
the ability, under certain circumstances after the Agreement Date, to furnish information to, and
conduct negotiations with, third parties regarding Acquisition Proposals;
•
Intersect ENT’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal,
subject to certain conditions of the Merger Agreement and paying Medtronic a termination fee of
$29.25 million (see below under the caption “The Merger Agreement-Fees and Expenses; Termination
Fee”);
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that the Intersect ENT Board believed and continues to believe that the termination fee of
$29.25 million, which is approximately 2.8% of the implied transaction value of the Merger, is
reasonable, is within the market averages for such fees payable in comparable transactions, and is not
preclusive of, or a substantial impediment to, other offers;
•
the fact that the adoption of the Merger Agreement is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of
the shares of Intersect ENT’s common stock, and Intersect ENT’s stockholders would be able to reject the
Merger;
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Intersect ENT’s stockholders who do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures
under Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware
court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be determined to be more than, less than, or the
same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement;
•
the ability of Intersect ENT to generally continue to operate its business in the ordinary course and
consistent with its operating plan during the pre-closing period; and
•
the fact that Medtronic agreed to provide Intersect ENT with pre-closing financing pursuant to an
unsecured subordinated loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million to be funded, at
the option of Intersect ENT, in five tranches of $15 million per fiscal quarter, as described further below
under the caption “The Merger Agreement-Unsecured Subordinated Loan Facility”.
The Intersect ENT Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the
following reasons (which reasons are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
•
the fact that Intersect ENT would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and
stockholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any
potential future appreciation in value of Intersect ENT;
•
the risks and costs to Intersect ENT if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner,
including the diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on our business
and relationships with customers, partners and employees;
•
the fact that Medtronic’s commitments in the Merger Agreement to seek to complete the Merger are subject
to specified limitations and that the necessary antitrust clearances to complete the Merger might not be
obtained in a timely manner, or at all (see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Antitrust Actions”
for more information);
•
the requirement that Intersect ENT pay to Medtronic a termination fee of $29.25 million, under certain
circumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Intersect ENT Board
terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or Medtronic terminates the Merger
Agreement based on a knowing, material breach by Intersect ENT of the non-solicitation provisions of the
Merger Agreement or if the Intersect ENT Board changes its recommendation (see below under the caption
“The Merger Agreement- Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee”);
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Intersect ENT’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which
may delay or prevent Intersect ENT from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the
completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT might have pursued;
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would generally be taxable to Intersect ENT’s stockholders that are U.S.
persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT is unable to solicit other Acquisition
Proposals after the Agreement Date until the termination of the Merger Agreement;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time
and effort of Intersect ENT management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business
operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;

•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of
termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of Intersect ENT’s common stock;
•
the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and under
certain foreign antitrust or competition laws;
•
the fact that Intersect ENT’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, those of Intersect ENT’s stockholders (see below under the caption “The Merger-
Interests of Intersect ENT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”); and

The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby addresses the information and reasons considered by the
Intersect ENT Board in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of reasons considered by the
Intersect ENT Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the
Intersect ENT Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific reasons considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information
and reasons described above, each individual member of the Intersect ENT Board applied his or her own personal
business judgment to the decision-making process and may have given differing weights to differing reasons. The
Intersect ENT Board based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The
explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth above contains forward-looking statements that should be read in
conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Intersect ENT Board that, as of August 5, 2021, and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.25 in cash per share of Intersect ENT common stock
to be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common
stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the
written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 5, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Intersect ENT
Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to
how any holder of shares of Intersect ENT common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman
Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Intersect ENT for the five fiscal years
ended December 31, 2020;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Intersect ENT;
•
certain other communications from Intersect ENT to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Intersect ENT; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Intersect ENT, which include the estimated benefits of
Intersect ENT’s net operating losses, prepared by management of Intersect ENT, as approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by Intersect ENT, referred to in this section as the “Forecasts”.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Intersect ENT regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Intersect ENT;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Intersect ENT common stock; compared certain
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
financial and stock market information for Intersect ENT with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the
medical technology industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered
such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Intersect ENT’s consent, relied upon and assumed the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,
discussed with or reviewed by it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Intersect ENT’s consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Intersect ENT. Goldman
Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Intersect ENT or any of its subsidiaries, and Goldman
Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without
any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also
assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Intersect ENT to engage in the
Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to
Intersect ENT; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $28.25 in cash per share
of Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding
shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express
any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any term or
aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in
connection with the Merger, including, the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Intersect ENT; nor as to
the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of Intersect ENT, or class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $28.25 in
cash per share of Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of
the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Intersect ENT common stock will trade at
any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Intersect ENT, Medtronic
or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Intersect ENT, Medtronic or Merger
Sub, or the ability of Intersect ENT, Medtronic or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come
due. In addition, Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other
conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion, and Goldman Sachs
assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of
Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Intersect ENT Board
in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a
complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses
described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries
of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the
full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data as it existed on or before August 4, 2021, the last trading day before Goldman Sachs orally rendered its
opinion to the Intersect ENT Board, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Implied Premia Analysis
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia described below based on the $28.25 in cash per share to
be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the Per Share Merger Consideration relative to:
•
$24.52, the closing trading price of the shares on August 5, 2021, the last trading day before the
announcement of the Merger (which we refer to as the “Current Share Price”);
•
$26.62, the highest closing trading price per share for the 52-week period ended August 5, 2021 (which we
refer to as the “52-Week High Price”); and
•
$15.14, the lowest closing trading price per share for the 52-week period ended August 5, 2021 (which we
refer to as the “52-Week Low Price”).
The results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows:

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Intersect ENT to
derive a range of illustrative present values per share.
Using discount rates ranging from 9.50% to 10.50%, reflecting estimates of Intersect ENT’s weighted average cost of
capital, utilizing a mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Intersect
ENT, by discounting to present value as of June 30, 2021, (a) estimates of the unlevered free cash flow to be
generated by Intersect ENT for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2035, including the estimated tax savings
associated with Intersect ENT’s net operating losses during such period, all as reflected in the Forecasts, and (b) a
range of illustrative terminal values for Intersect ENT, calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from
2.5% to 3.5% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by Intersect ENT, as reflected
in the Forecasts (which analysis implied a range of multiples of next twelve-month terminal EBITDA (defined as
operating income plus depreciation and amortization (excluding transaction-related amortization)) of 9.5x to 12.8x).
Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including Intersect ENT’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt,
future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Intersect ENT, as well as certain financial metrics for the United
States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term
real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Intersect ENT by adding the range of present
values it derived in step (a) as described in the above paragraph to the range of present values it derived in step (b)
as described in the above paragraph. Goldman Sachs then subtracted Intersect ENT’s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as
provided by management of Intersect ENT, from such combined range to derive a range of illustrative equity values
for Intersect ENT. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the total number of
fully diluted shares outstanding as of August 2, 2021 calculated using treasury stock method, and assuming a $60
million dollar equity offering in the second half of 2021 at a 15% discount to the $24.48 current stock price, in each
case as provided by the management of Intersect ENT, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of
$22.06 to $28.37.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share
of Intersect ENT common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the calendar years
2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value of Intersect ENT as of December 31 for each
of the calendar years 2021 to 2023, by multiplying the one-year forward revenue as of such date by an illustrative
range of multiples of 4.5x to 6.5x. These illustrative multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional
judgment and experience based on various factors, including Intersect ENT’s historical trading multiples as well as
the historical trading multiples of comparable public companies. To derive illustrative implied equity values per
Intersect ENT common stock, Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Intersect ENT’s projected net debt as of
December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, as provided by management of Intersect ENT, from the range of
implied enterprise values. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully diluted
shares outstanding, as provided by management of Intersect ENT and calculated using treasury stock method, to
determine implied equity values per share of Intersect ENT common stock as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied equity values per share to June 30, 2021, using a discount rate of
10.0%, reflecting an estimate of Intersect ENT’s cost of equity. These analyses resulted in a range of implied present
values of $19.02 to $30.16 per share.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain acquisition transactions announced
over the last 10 years involving target companies in the medical technology industry with an implied enterprise value
ranging from $500 million to $4 billion.
While none of the target companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Intersect ENT and none of
the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Merger, the target companies in the selected transactions are
companies with certain operations that, for the purposes of analysis, Goldman Sachs considered to be sufficiently
similar, in its judgement, to certain operations of Intersect ENT based on various factors, including those in the
medical technology sector in some cases with similar characteristics in some respects as Intersect ENT.
Using publicly available information, for each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied
enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction, as a
multiple of the estimated revenue of the target company for the last twelve-month (“LTM Revenue”) period ended
prior to announcement of each applicable transaction, as disclosed in public company filings and other publicly
available information. The selected transactions and the implied enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples
calculated for the transactions are set forth below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The analysis indicated a median implied enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiple of 6.6x for the selected
transactions. Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various
transactions and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of enterprise
value to LTM EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 8.0x to Intersect ENT’s LTM Revenue as of June 30, 2021 to derive a range
of implied enterprise values for Intersect ENT. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values
(a) cash payment to holders of Intersect ENT’s options, RSUs, performance-based options, PSUs, and convertible
debt and (b) Intersect ENT’s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as provided by management of Intersect ENT, and divided
the result by the implied total number of basic shares outstanding as of August 2, 2021, based on the derived range
of illustrative equity values, to derive a range of implied values per share of $14.70 to $22.70.
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data, the premia paid in acquisitions of publicly
traded companies in the United States announced during the period from January 1, 2016 through August 4, 2021 in
which the target company had an implied enterprise value of $0.5 billion to $4.0 billion. For the entire period from
January 1, 2016 through August 4, 2021, Goldman Sachs calculated the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the
premia paid in acquisitions announced during such period relative to the target company’s unaffected stock price at
the close of trading on the day prior to the original announcement of the transaction.
Based on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a
reference range of illustrative premia of 9%-41% (based on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the premia paid in
acquisitions announced in the entire period relative to the target company’s share price over the 1-trading day prior
to the original announcement of the transaction) to the closing price per share on August 4, 2021 of $24.48. This
analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of $26.67 to $34.53.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Intersect ENT or
Medtronic or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Intersect ENT
Board as to the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders (other than
Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock of the $28.25 in cash per share
of Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do
not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may
be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors, none of Intersect ENT, Medtronic, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if
future results are materially different from those forecast.
The consideration of $28.25 in cash per share of Intersect ENT common stock was determined through arm’s-length
negotiations between Intersect ENT and Medtronic and was approved by the Intersect ENT Board. Goldman Sachs
provided advice to Intersect ENT during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any
specific amount of consideration to Intersect ENT or the Intersect ENT Board or that any specific amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Intersect ENT Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Intersect ENT Board in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The
foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in
connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman
Sachs attached as Annex B.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and
trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various
persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in
which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold
or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of Intersect ENT, Medtronic, any of their respective affiliates and third
parties or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor
to Intersect ENT in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger.
Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Intersect ENT and/or its
affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,
compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Intersect ENT in connection with its acquisition of
Fiagon AG Medical Technologies in October 2020, and as financial advisor to Intersect ENT in connection with its
convertible notes financing in May 2020. During the two-year period ended August 5, 2021, the Investment Banking
Division of Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services
provided by its Investment Banking Division to Intersect ENT and/or its affiliates of approximately $4 million.
Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Medtronic and/or its affiliates
from time to time for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,
compensation, including having acted as co-manager to Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A., an affiliate of Medtronic,
in connection with its senior notes offering in September 2020. During the two-year period ended August 5, 2021, the
Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or
underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Medtronic and/or its affiliates of approximately
$500,000. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Intersect
ENT, Medtronic and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division may receive
compensation.
The Intersect ENT Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger, including with respect
to acquisitions of public companies in the medical technology industry. Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated
August 3, 2021, Intersect ENT engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger.
The engagement letter between Intersect ENT and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of approximately $18
million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Intersect ENT has agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws.",35,43
"Intersect ENT, Inc._20210907_DEFM14A_19520364_4290965.Pdf",Management Projections,"Management Projections
While Intersect ENT has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning aspects of its expected financial
performance from time to time, Intersect ENT does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal
projections as to future performance or results of operations due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying
assumptions and projections. However, in the second quarter of 2020, in connection with Intersect ENT’s initial
evaluation of Medtronic’s first proposal, Intersect ENT’s management, at the direction of the Board, prepared certain
non-public, unaudited, long-range financial projections (collectively, the “Initial Projections”). Such Initial Projections
were provided to Medtronic by Intersect ENT’s senior management.
Subsequently, in the third quarter of 2021, Intersect ENT updated certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial
information for fiscal years 2021 through 2035 in connection with Medtronic’s subsequent proposal to purchase
Intersect ENT at a price per share of $28.25 (such non-public, unaudited prospective financial information, the
“Projections”). Intersect ENT management provided the Projections to the Board and, after review, the Board
approved such Projections. At the direction of the Board, Intersect ENT management provided the Projections to
Goldman Sachs. The Board directed Goldman Sachs to use the Projections in connection with rendering its fairness
opinion and providing its financial analysis to the Board in connection with the Board’s evaluation of potential
strategic alternatives, including the Merger. The Projections were also provided to Medtronic in July 2021.
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance
35TABLE OF CONTENTS
with the published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections of prospective financial information. The non-GAAP
financial measures used in the Projections were relied upon by the Board in connection with its consideration of the
Merger and the merger consideration. While Intersect ENT believes that such non-GAAP financial measures provide
useful supplemental information in analyzing Intersect ENT’s unaudited prospective financial performance, there are
limitations associated with the use of such financial measures. Such non-GAAP measures as used by Intersect ENT
may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in
isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The SEC rules, which
otherwise would require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure, do not apply
to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in connection with a proposed
business combination transaction such as the proposed Transactions if the disclosure is included in a document
such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to a GAAP financial
measure were not provided to or relied upon by the Board or Goldman Sachs in connection with the Merger.
Accordingly, Intersect ENT has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Projections to
the relevant GAAP financial measures. The Projections may differ from published analyst estimates and forecasts,
and do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the
announcement of the Transactions.
The Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by Intersect ENT management with respect to general
business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of
which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Intersect ENT’s control. In particular, the Projections,
while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions (as
described below) that are inherently uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they
become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that
will have an effect on Intersect ENT’s business and its results of operations.
The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding Intersect ENT in its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by Intersect
ENT management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and
therefore the Projections do not give effect to the Transactions or any changes to Intersect ENT’s operations or
strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including any costs incurred in connection
with the Transactions. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the
Transactions to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the
Projections in this proxy should not be regarded as an indication that Intersect ENT, its advisors or anyone who
received the Projections then considered, or now considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual
future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. Intersect ENT management views the
Projections as being subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such long-range projections.
Non-GAAP operating income and unlevered free cash flow contained in the Projections set forth below are each
“non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with
GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and
may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations
inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included
in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and
not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The information set forth below is
included solely to give Intersect ENT stockholders access to financial projections that were made available to the
Board and Goldman Sachs and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder’s
decision to vote with respect to the Merger Proposal or for any other purpose.
For purposes of calculating the Projections, Intersect ENT management made several assumptions based on their
reasonable business judgment, including assuming a return to growth in 2021, the continued market penetration of
PROPEL® and SINUVA®, the successful launch of the VenSure product line and the CUBE 4D
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
system, the positive outcomes of the OM1 Study and the EXPAND trial, the further segmentation of the surgical and
office markets, the growth and penetration of international markets, the ongoing success of the R&D pipeline, and
the continued ability to execute inorganic products transactions. In addition, the Projections include a return to
historic gross margins in the legacy products, the successful implementations of global IT systems to improve
productivity and continuing access to capital markets to fund operations and activities.

Unlevered free cash flow refers to operating income, less cash taxes, capital expenditures, changes in net working capital, and
delayed consideration to Fiagon, plus depreciation and amortization and is burdened by stock-based compensation. Unlevered free
cash includes utilization of Intersect ENT’s net operating losses and research and development tax credits (collectively “NOLs”)
assuming a tax rate of 21% and that Intersect ENT continued as a standalone entity without any limitations on the use of its
NOLs.
Interests of Intersect ENT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of the Intersect ENT Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below.
The Intersect ENT Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that they
existed at the time, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by stockholders. These interests are described in more detail and, where applicable, are
quantified in the narrative below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause Intersect ENT, as the
Surviving Corporation, to indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of Intersect ENT or any of its present or former subsidiaries or corporate parents
(collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the Transactions) to the fullest extent that the Surviving Corporation is permitted by law,
and Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent that the Surviving Corporation is permitted by law. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Intersect ENT as amended, restated and in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will keep in full force
and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement between or among Intersect ENT or any of its subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party.
Parent will cause to be maintained, in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time, the current policies of
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Intersect ENT and Intersect
ENT’s subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise
covered by such insurance policies prior to the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefore would not be in excess of two
hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
37
(1)
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective Time (the “Maximum Premium”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT may, prior to the
Effective Time, purchase a so-called “Reporting Tail Endorsement” with an annual premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, in which case, provided that Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting
Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will be relieved
from its other indemnification and insurance obligations described above.
The directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification provisions in the Merger Agreement will be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, Intersect ENT and the Surviving Corporation. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Parent guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other
related obligations and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
Treatment of Series D Preferred Stock, Company Options, Performance Options, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs
At the Effective Time, each:
(i)
share of Company Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by a factor of 1,000;
(ii)
Company Option that is unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and for which
the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price of such Company Option, and without
regard to whether such Company Option is vested or unvested, shall be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of
unexercised shares then subject to such Company Option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over such Company Option’s per share exercise price;
(iii) Performance Option, to the extent outstanding and not vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be automatically cancelled without consideration and each Vested Performance Option shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(1) the aggregate number of unexercised shares then subject to such Vested Performance Option, multiplied
by (2) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such Vested Performance Option’s per
share exercise price;
(iv) Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and, in consideration of such cancellation, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (B) the
aggregate number of shares then underlying such Company RSU; and
(v)
Company PSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled without consideration; provided that each Vested Company PSU shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(A) the aggregate number of shares then subject to such Vested Company PSU, multiplied by (B) the Per
Share Merger Consideration.
Each Option for which, as of the Effective time, the Per Share Merger Consideration does not exceed the exercise
price of such Company Option shall be automatically cancelled as of the Effective Time for no consideration.

other than taxes under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) such that he would retain an amount of the gross-
up payment equal to the excise tax imposed upon the payments.
Each executive officer’s receipt of the severance benefits under his or her offer letter is subject to (i) the executive
officer signing a standard separation agreement and release of claims with Intersect ENT and provided that such
release becomes effective and irrevocable no later than sixty (60) days following his or her “separation from service”
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and (ii) the executive officer’s continued
compliance with his or her employee confidential information and invention assignment agreement with Intersect
ENT.
For the purposes of each executive officer’s offer letter, “cause” is defined as (i) embezzlement, misappropriation of
corporate funds, or other material acts of dishonesty, (ii) commission or conviction of any felony, or of any
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any felony or misdemeanor,
(iii) engagement in any activity the executive officer knows or should know could materially harm Intersect ENT’s
business or reputation, (iv) material failure to adhere to Intersect ENT’s corporate codes, policies or procedures, (v)
material violation of any statutory, contractual, or common law duty or obligation to Intersect ENT, (vi) repeated
failure to substantially perform assigned duties or responsibilities after notice and opportunity to cure, or (vii)
material breach of the executive officer’s employee confidential information and invention assignment agreement.
For the purposes of each executive officer’s offer letter, “good reason” is defined as (i) a relocation of the office
where the executive officer is assigned to a location of more than 35 miles away, (ii) a material decrease in base salary
(except for salary decreases generally applicable to Intersect ENT’s other executive employees), or (iii) a material
reduction in the scope of the executive officer’s duties or responsibilities, in each case without the executive officer’s
written consent; provided, however, to resign for good reason the executive officer must provide notice to Intersect
ENT within 30 days of the first occurrence of the event giving rise to good reason and give Intersect ENT 30 days to
cure such event, and if not cured then must resign within 90 days of the expiration of the cure period.
For the purposes of each executive officer’s offer letter, “change in control” generally means (i) any consolidation or
merger of Intersect ENT with or into any other corporation or other entity or a corporate reorganization, other than
such consolidation, merger or reorganization where the stockholders of Intersect ENT continue to hold a majority of
the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; (ii) any
transaction or series of related transactions to which Intersect ENT is a party in which in excess of 50% of Intersect
ENT’s voting power is transferred, other than any transaction principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in
which cash is received by Intersect ENT or indebtedness of Intersect ENT is cancelled or converted or a combination
thereof; or (iii) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Intersect
ENT.
Quantification of Potential Payments to Intersect ENT’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of Intersect ENT’s named executive officers
in connection with the Merger. Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon
Termination At or Following Change in Control” for further information regarding this compensation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The table below assumes that: (i) for the purposes of this table only, that the closing of the Merger occurs on August
20, 2021; (ii) the employment of Messrs. West, Meier, and Broderick, and Ms. Fernandez will be terminated
immediately following the closing of the Merger in a manner entitling the named executive officer to receive the
severance benefits described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination At or
Following Change in Control”; (iii) no named executive officer receives any additional incentive equity grants on or
prior to the closing of the Merger; and (iv) no named executive officer enters into new agreements or otherwise
becomes legally entitled to, prior to the closing of the Merger, additional compensation or benefits. Pursuant to
applicable proxy disclosure rules, the value of the equity award acceleration below is calculated based on the number
of shares covered by the applicable Options, Company RSUs, and Company PSUs that are accelerating multiplied by
$28.25 per share (less the applicable exercise price per share in the case of Options). The amounts shown in the table
below do not include the value of payments or benefits that would have been earned, or any amounts associated
with equity awards that would vest pursuant to their terms, on or prior to the closing of the Merger, or the value of
payments or benefits that are not based on or otherwise related to the Merger.
In addition to the assumptions described in the preceding paragraph, the amounts set forth in the table below are
based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. The
assumptions based upon which we have estimated the amounts in the table below may or may not actually occur.
Accordingly, the ultimate amounts to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may
differ from the amounts set forth below.

The amounts listed in this column for Messrs. West, Meier, and Broderick, and Ms. Fernandez, represent the “double-trigger” cash
severance payments to which each of these named executive officers may become entitled under his or her offer letter, as
described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change
in Control”. To be eligible for such cash severance benefits, the employment of the named executive officer must terminate
without “cause” or for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the applicable offer letter and as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control”) (for the purposes of the
table above, a “Qualifying CIC Termination”). Of the amounts listed in this column, a portion represents salary severance based
on the applicable named executive officer’s salary in effect as of August 20, 2021, which for Mr. West is $930,010, for Mr.
Meier is $466,211, for Ms. Fernandez is $335,005, and for Mr. Broderick is $400,005. Of the amounts listed in this column, the
remaining portion represents the cash bonus severance to which each executive may become entitled under their offer letter, as
described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change
in Control”, based on each such executive’s target bonus opportunity in effect as of August 20, 2021, which for Mr. West is
$315,269, for Mr. Meier is $148,166, for Ms. Fernandez is $85,174, and for Mr. Broderick is $127,125.
(3)
For each of Messrs. West, Meier, and Broderick, and Ms. Fernandez, the amount listed in this column represents the estimated
value of “single-trigger” vesting acceleration benefits to which the named executive officer may become entitled under the
Merger Agreement, and such amount was determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-
Interests of Intersect ENT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Series D Preferred Stock, Company
Options, Performance Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs”, and which is as follows: $11,650,088 (of which
$4,357,294 relates to Options, $3,817,112 relates to Company RSUs, and $3,475,682 relates to Company PSUs), $4,028,802
(of which $444,471 relates to Options, $1,475,724 relates to Company RSUs, and $2,108,608 relates to Company PSUs),
$1,055,273 (of which $250,741 relates to Company Options, $454,938 relates to Company RSUs, and $349,594 relates to
Company PSUs) and $1,582,920 (of which $376,108 relates to Options, $682,407 relates to Company RSUs, and $524,405
relates to Company PSUs), respectively. Amounts included for PSUs represent the value associated with vested PSUs only;
unvested PSUs will be cancelled without consideration.
(4)
The amounts listed in this column represent the estimated value of the reimbursement of continued health coverage premiums
under COBRA benefits to which each of Messrs. West, Meier, and Broderick, and Ms. Fernandez, may become entitled under his
or her offer letter, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “ -Payments Upon Termination
At or Following Change in Control”. To be eligible for such COBRA reimbursement benefits, the employment of the named
executive officer’s employment must terminate without “cause” or for “good reason”. The full amount represents the value of
reimbursement of continued health coverage under COBRA based on the applicable named executive officer’s estimated cost for
such coverage as of August 20, 2021.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(5)
The amounts listed in this column represent the estimated value of additional payments that each of Messrs. West, Meier, and
Broderick, and Ms. Fernandez, are entitled to under their amended offer letters (“Gross-Up Payment”). The Gross-Up Payment is
equal to an amount such that, after payment by the executive of all taxes, including, without limitation, any income taxes and
excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code imposed on the Gross-Up Payment, such executive retains an amount of the Gross-
Up Payment equal to the taxed imposed on the payments described in the table above.
Equity Awards Held by Intersect ENT’s Executive Officers and Non-employee Directors
As discussed above, at the Effective Time, each Company Option, Company RSU, Vested Performance Option, and
Vested Company PSU (including those held by Intersect ENT’s executive officers and non-employee directors) will be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the applicable consideration, and each unvested
Performance Option and unvested Company PSU (including those held by Intersect ENT’s executive officers) will be
cancelled without consideration.
Each of Intersect ENT’s executive officers is eligible to receive the applicable vesting acceleration benefits with
respect to his or her equity awards described above under the heading “Payments Upon Termination At or Following
Change in Control”.
Equity Interests of Intersect ENT’s Executive Officers and Non-employee Directors
The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock
underlying equity awards held by each of Intersect ENT’s executive officers and non-employee directors that are
outstanding as of August 20, 2021. The table also sets forth the values of these shares and equity awards,
determined as the number of shares multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration (minus the applicable per share
exercise price for any Options). Only Options with an exercise price lower than the Per Share Merger Consideration
are being cancelled in exchange for consideration; Options with an exercise price higher than or equal to the Per
Share Merger Consideration are being cancelled without consideration. No additional shares of common stock or
equity awards were granted to any executive officer or non-employee director in contemplation of the Merger.",43,50

The number of shares of common stock subject to Options includes both vested and unvested Company Options, but only vested
Performance Options. Only Options with an exercise price lower than the Per Share Merger Consideration are being cancelled in
exchange for consideration (“In-the-Money Options”); Options with an exercise price higher than the Per Share Merger
Consideration are being cancelled without consideration (“Out-of-the-Money Options”). All Performance Options are becoming
fully vested upon the closing and are being cancelled in exchange for consideration. The number of shares subject to the In-the-
Money Options and Out-of-the Money Options, and the value (determined as the aggregate number of underlying shares

This number reflects the number of shares of common stock subject to Company RSUs that were not vested as of August 20,
2021.

The number of shares of common stock subject to PSUs includes both vested and unvested Company PSUs. Only vested
Company PSUs are being cancelled in exchange for consideration; unvested Company PSUs are being cancelled without
consideration. Of the amount listed in this column, a portion represents the vested Company PSUs, which for Mr. West is
$3,475,682, for Mr. Meier is $2,108,608, for Ms. Fernandez is $349,594, and for Mr. Broderick is $524,405; these amounts
assume that a portion of the Company PSUs will vest prior to Closing. Of the amount listed in this column, the remaining
portion represents unvested Company PSUs.

The closing of the Merger will take place on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver in
accordance with the Merger Agreement of all of the conditions to closing of the Merger (as described under the
caption, “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”), other than
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions.
Appraisal Rights
Stockholders of Intersect ENT (i) who continuously hold shares through the Effective Time, (ii) who did not vote
their shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, (iv) who otherwise properly comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of
Section 262 of the DGCL; and (v) who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares, fail to
perfect or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will be
entitled to demand appraisal of their shares and receive, if the Merger is successful and the Merger is consummated,
in lieu of the Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the “fair value” of their shares (as of the Effective
Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest, if any), as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their Shares could be more than, the same as or less than the
Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise
address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal
rights should review carefully the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to
properly demand and perfect such rights.
The following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy as Annex C. This summary
does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the
DGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder
of shares immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as
43TABLE OF CONTENTS
to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person holding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name
of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the stockholder of record to follow the
steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to follow any of the
procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in termination or waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that Intersect ENT will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of
any stockholder.
Any stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the
DGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that
Company stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of the
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders entitled
to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.
This proxy statement constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the
required copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. Any stockholder who
wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the
following discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures
specified may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the
following:
•
deliver to Intersect ENT at the address indicated below a written demand for appraisal of his, her or its
shares prior to the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, which written demand must
reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand
appraisal of his, her or its shares. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate
from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting
“AGAINST” or failing to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a
demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL;
•
not vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
continuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made
through the Effective Time of the Merger; and
•
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including
filing of a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of your
shares of common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger.
Within 10 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the effective
date of the Merger to those stockholders of Intersect ENT who have properly made a written demand for appraisal
pursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, have not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and have not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is
consummated, a failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the
first bullet above (or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a
termination of your appraisal rights. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any
stockholder who has demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, without
interest, specified by the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60
days after the Effective Time of the Merger will require the written approval of the Surviving Corporation and no
appraisal proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the
approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder that has
made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger. If the
Surviving Corporation does not approve a stockholder’s request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when the
approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding,
the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding.
This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Written Demand by the Stockholder
All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Intersect ENT, Inc., 1555 Adams Drive, Menlo Park,
California 94025. Attention: General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of
record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder’s name appears on the stockholder’s certificates (whether in book
entry or on physical certificates) evidencing such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of record in a
fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that capacity, and if
the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand
must be made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record, but such agent must identify the record owner or owners and
expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of such shares.
A beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions
as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If
shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central
securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on
behalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any
beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible
for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record. The beneficial holder of the
shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record
of the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.
A record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee
for several beneficial owners (may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial
owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the
written demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for
appraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such
stockholder.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their
shares in favor of the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that
120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their
shares. None of Parent, Merger Sub or Intersect ENT, as the Surviving Corporation, has any obligation to or has any
present intention to file a petition and stockholders should not assume that any of the foregoing parties will file a
petition or will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of
the stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the
period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the
DGCL and the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights set forth herein will be entitled, upon written request, to
receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received, and the
aggregate number of stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written
request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing
requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person
who is the beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to
which demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition
for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the
petition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the “Verified List”) containing the names
and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the “Dissenting Stockholders”)
and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a petition by a
Dissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place
fixed for the hearing on the petition will be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders
shown on the Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed
advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving
Corporation.
If a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to determine which Dissenting
Stockholders have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their
shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their share certificates, if
any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does
not comply with such requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their share
certificates after the Effective Time and thereafter comply with all orders of the Delaware Court of Chancery in respect
of such certificates. In addition, assuming the shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately
before the Effective Time, which we expect to be the case, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to dismiss the
appraisal proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the
Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the fair value of the shares as of the Effective Time exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may
pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only
upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid by the Surviving Corporation and the fair value
of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash
payment, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market
value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
future prospects of the merged corporation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements
of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to
be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion that does not
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from
such accomplishment or expectation. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial
point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the
DGCL. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be
more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under
the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the Verified List
and who has submitted such stockholder’s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights. When the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the
payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of
uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates. The Delaware
Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may also (i) determine the costs of the proceeding (which do not include attorneys’
fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder, order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to
appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations by the Delaware Court
of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Stockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined
under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to
be paid in the Merger. Although Intersect ENT believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is
made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither
Parent nor Intersect ENT anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and
each of Parent and Intersect ENT reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section
262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of the shares is less than the Merger Consideration.
The process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites.
Stockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL
will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date
prior to the Effective Time.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully
withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares will be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, the stockholder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as Intersect ENT has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present
intention to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely basis. In addition, a
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger
Consideration by delivering to Intersect ENT a written withdrawal of such
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and acceptance of the terms of the Merger either within 60 days after the effective
date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of Intersect ENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the effective
date of the Merger.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL
NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL
RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
The foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of Intersect ENT to seek appraisal rights under Delaware
law does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of Intersect
ENT desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions
of the DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this Proxy.",51,56

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders
(as defined below) of shares of Intersect ENT common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive
cash pursuant to the Merger. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), existing and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published
positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of
this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with
retroactive effect. No ruling from the IRS and no opinion of counsel will be requested in connection with the Merger
or related transactions. Accordingly, the summary below neither binds the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a
contrary position. This summary is limited to stockholders who hold their shares of Intersect ENT common stock as
“capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).
This summary is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances including, but not limited to, stockholders who, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
are banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, tax-exempt entities, government organizations, retirement
plans or accounts, financial institutions, or broker-dealers or traders in securities or currencies;
•
hold their shares of Intersect ENT common stock through individual retirement or other tax-deferred
accounts;
•
hold shares of Intersect ENT common stock that constitutes “qualified small business stock” under Section
1202 of the Code or “Section 1244 stock” for purposes of Section 1244 of the Code;
•
acquired their shares of Intersect ENT common stock in a transaction subject to the gain rollover
provisions of the Code (including, but not limited to Section 1045 of the Code);
•
acquired their shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the exercise of compensatory options
(including Company Options) or in other compensatory transactions;
•
acquired their shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants or conversion
rights under convertible instruments;
•
hold their shares of Intersect ENT common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a
branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
48TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
•
are corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
•
are real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;
•
elect the mark-to-market method of accounting for their shares of Intersect ENT common stock;
•
are deemed to sell or to have sold their shares of Intersect ENT common stock under the constructive sale
provisions of the Code;
•
hold their shares of Intersect ENT common stock as part of an integrated investment (including a hedging,
“straddle,” conversion or other integrated or risk-reduction transaction);
•
hold or held (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of Intersect ENT stock (by vote or
value);
•
are not U.S. Holders (as defined below);
•
exercise appraisal or dissenters’ rights; or
•
are partnerships or entities or arrangements classified as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, S corporations or other pass-through entities (including hybrid entities) and
investors and partnership in such entities.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Intersect ENT common stock, then the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and
the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Intersect ENT common stock and partners therein should consult
their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.
This summary does not address (i) any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S.
jurisdiction (ii) any U.S. federal non-income tax (such as estate, gift or other taxes), (iii) the impact of the alternative
minimum tax, the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the special tax accounting rules under
Section 451(b) of the Code that may be applicable to stockholders, or (iv) the tax considerations associated with
transactions occurring prior to, concurrently with, or after the Merger (whether or not such transactions are
consummated in connection with the Merger).
THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A
SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX PLANNING AND ADVICE. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX
ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT
AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR
NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Intersect ENT common stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States or who is treated as a citizen or resident of the
United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and the control of one or more
U.S. persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person under the Code.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Intersect ENT
common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss, if any, equal to the difference
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
between (1) the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its
shares of Intersect ENT common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. The amount, character and timing of
such gain or loss generally will be determined separately with respect to each block of stock owned by such U.S.
Holder surrendered in the Merger. For purposes of the foregoing, a block of stock is generally comprised of those
shares of a particular class of stock of a company which were acquired at the same time and at the same price. A U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Intersect ENT
common stock. A U.S. Holder’s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Intersect ENT common stock generally
will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.
Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger and
otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S.
Holders, including individuals, are currently subject to taxation at preferential rates. Short-term capital gains are taxed
at the same rates applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a
stockholder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to a U.S. Holder that furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form). Each stockholder should consult his or her own tax advisors regarding
the application of backup withholding in his or her particular circumstances and the availability of, and procedure for
obtaining (i) an exemption from backup withholding and (ii) a credit, refund or other tax benefit with respect to any
amount of backup withholding.
The foregoing summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular
holders of shares of Intersect ENT common stock. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the
particular tax consequences to them of exchanging their shares of Intersect ENT common stock for cash pursuant to
the Merger under any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

"Intersect ENT, Inc._20210907_DEFM14A_19520364_4290965.Pdf",Regulatory Matters,"Regulatory Matters
General
Subject to certain limitations, Parent has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions necessary
to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with antitrust laws, and to enable all
waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws to terminate or expire, and to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under applicable antitrust laws asserted by any governmental entity, in each
case, to cause the Merger to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the End Date. This includes,
for example, making an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable, and to make all other filings required or advisable by applicable foreign antitrust laws with respect to the
Merger as promptly as practicable.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisitions may not be completed until
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal
Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the applicable HSR Act waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting
period under the HSR Act is 30 calendar days, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier (provided, however, that
the FTC has temporarily suspended granting early termination other than in narrow circumstances that do not apply
during the initial 30 day waiting period), extended by a request for additional information and documentary material,
or restarted if Parent voluntarily withdraws and refiles to allow a second 30 calendar day waiting period. The Merger
is subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until Intersect ENT and Parent file a
notification and report form with the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has
expired or been terminated. Intersect ENT and Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ on August 23, 2021. Intersect ENT and Parent may also file pre-merger or post-merger
notification filings, forms or submissions with other governmental entities pursuant to other applicable antitrust laws
in connection with the Merger.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could investigate the Merger or take such action
50TABLE OF CONTENTS
under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets or business lines of the parties, seeking to impose
conditions or limitations on one or both parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and
notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign
jurisdiction could investigate the Merger or take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or
desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets or business lines of the parties, seeking to impose conditions or limitations on one or
both parties, or seeking to require the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and
contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,
we will prevail.
Other Regulatory Matters
One or more governmental agencies, including government agencies outside the United States, may impose a
condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary consents, clearances or
approvals. Third parties may seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or prevent consummation
of the Merger, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory
consents, clearances or approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the
required regulatory consents, clearances or approvals or whether they will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.
Although we expect that all required termination or expiration of waiting periods and any required regulatory
consents, clearances or approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these will be timely obtained, obtained
at all or that they will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including
the requirement to divest assets or business lines, agree to certain conditions or limitations, or require changes to the
terms of the Merger Agreement. These could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.
Legal Proceedings
Subsequent to the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement on August 27, 2021, a civil action was filed challenging
the adequacy of certain public disclosures made by Intersect ENT concerning Intersect ENT's proposed transaction
with Medtronic. On September 1, 2021, Elaine Wang, a purported stockholder of Intersect ENT, commenced an action
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Elaine Wang v. Intersect ENT,
Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-7348, against Intersect ENT and current members of the Intersect ENT Board. The Wang
Complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks, among other things, an
injunction preventing consummation of the proposed transaction with Medtronic, rescission of the proposed
transaction or rescissory damages in the event it is consummated, an accounting by the defendants for all damages
caused to the plaintiff, and the award of attorneys' fees and expenses. Intersect ENT and the current members of the
Intersect ENT Board have not been served with the Wang Complaint. Defendants believe the claims asserted in these
complaints are without merit, deny any wrongdoing in connection with the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement,
and intend to vigorously defend against the claims.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger
Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger
Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the
information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are
governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information
contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the
representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating
contractual risk between Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may
be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.
Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of Intersect ENT, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change
after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement
as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may
take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger
Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice
to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with
information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding
Intersect ENT, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties,

At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any stockholder, each share of common stock (other than
shares of common stock (A) owned by Intersect ENT as treasury stock, (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (C)
held by a Company stockholder who properly demands appraisal for such dissenting shares) issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and retired, and automatically converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Outstanding Company Options, Performance Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs
At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and for which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price of such Company Option, and
without regard to whether such Company Option is vested or unvested, shall be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of unexercised
shares then subject to such Company Option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over such Company Option’s per share exercise price.
At the Effective Time, each Performance Option, to the extent outstanding and not vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be cancelled without consideration and each Vested Performance Option shall be automatically
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number
of unexercised shares then subject to such Vested Performance Option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over such Vested Performance Option’s per share exercise price.
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time

receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (B) the aggregate
number of shares then underlying such Company RSU.
At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically cancelled without consideration; provided that each Vested Company PSU shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
aggregate number of shares then subject to such Vested Company PSU, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.
Any Options (whether vested or unvested) with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than $28.25 will be
cancelled immediately upon the Effective Time without payment or consideration.
Intersect ENT’s Amended and Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”) and the Intersect
ENT equity incentive plans will terminate as of the Effective Time.
Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Merger Agreement generally provides that no new offering periods or purchase periods will begin under the
Company ESPP after August 6, 2021, and no individual will be allowed to begin participating in the ESPP after August
6, 2021. After August 6, 2021, each Company ESPP participant will not be allowed to increase his or her payroll
contribution rate from the rate in effect as of August 6, 2021, or make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP,
except as required by applicable law. Any purchase period that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time
will end no later than five days before the Effective Time. All outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP
will be deemed to have been exercised no later than five business days before the Effective Time, and the Company

Prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will designate a United States bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to Intersect ENT (the “Paying Agent”) to make payments of the Merger Consideration to holders of common stock
and holders of Series D Preferred Stock. At or prior to the closing, Parent will deliver to the Paying Agent sufficient
funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to stockholders.
Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days), Parent will cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record a letter of transmittal in customary form and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such holder’s shares of common stock represented by such holder’s certificate or book-entry shares
in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares. The amount of any Per Share
Merger Consideration paid to stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.

board recommendation, disclosure documents, interested party transactions and opinion of financial advisor. These
representations and warranties were made to and solely for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub as of specific dates.
The assertions embodied in such representations and warranties are qualified by information contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule and by certain portions of the SEC filings filed by Intersect ENT prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, such representations and warranties may not be relied on as characterizations
of the actual state of facts or circumstances, since they were only made as of the date of the Merger Agreement and
are modified in important part by the underlying Company Disclosure Schedule.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the
date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Intersect ENT’s
public disclosures. Certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement provide exceptions for items that
are not reasonably likely to have a “Company Material Adverse Effect.”
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Company Material Adverse Effect” means any event, circumstance,
change or effect that has a material adverse change in, or material adverse effect on, the business, financial condition
or results of operations of Intersect ENT and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any change
or effect resulting from (i) the industries and markets in which Intersect ENT and its subsidiaries operate, (ii) the
United States or the global economy or (iii) the United States financial or securities markets will be excluded from the
determination of Company Material Adverse Effect, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), to the extent they have not
had, or would reasonably be expected not to have, a materially disproportionate effect on Intersect ENT and its
subsidiaries relative to other companies in the same industry as Intersect ENT; and provided further that any change
or effect resulting from the following, will not constitute, and will not be considered in determining whether there has
occurred, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (1) the execution or the announcement of the Merger Agreement
(except to the extent that such change or effect was the result of a breach of the certain representations and
warranties in the Merger Agreement), (2) natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19), acts of war,
terrorism or sabotage, military actions or the escalation thereof or other force majeure events, to the extent they have
not had, or would reasonably be expected not to have, a materially disproportionate effect on Intersect ENT and its
subsidiaries relative to other companies in the same industry, (3) changes in generally accepted accounting principles
or changes in the
54TABLE OF CONTENTS
interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles, or changes in the accounting rules and regulations of the
SEC, (4) any enactment or other action required by law, required by the Merger Agreement or taken at the request of
Parent or Merger Sub, (5) any litigation brought or threatened by stockholders of either Parent or Intersect ENT
(whether on behalf of Intersect ENT, Parent or otherwise) asserting allegations of breach of fiduciary duty relating to
the Merger Agreement or violations of securities laws in connection with the proxy statement or any other
documents required to be filed by Intersect ENT with the SEC or disseminated to stockholders in connection with the
Transactions, (6) any changes in law or interpretations thereof (including any health reform statutes, rules or
regulations or interpretations thereof), (7) any action required to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC or
the SEC comment process, in each case, in connection with the proxy statement or any other documents required to
be filed by Intersect ENT with the SEC or disseminated to stockholders in connection with the Transactions, (8) any
decrease in the market price or trading volume of the shares (but not the underlying cause of such decrease), (9) any
failure by Intersect ENT to meet any projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions, or any predictions or
expectations of Intersect ENT or of any securities analysts (but not the underlying cause of such failure) or (10) any
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement will not survive the consummation of the
Merger.

The Merger Agreement requires Intersect ENT to cease all existing discussions and negotiations with any persons
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliates thereof) with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to:
•
an offer or proposal to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
20% or more of the shares pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions
involving Intersect ENT; or
•
an offer or proposal to acquire 20% or more of the assets of Intersect ENT and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.
Each of the above bullet points is referred to in the Merger Agreement as an “Acquisition Proposal”.
Except as provided in the following two paragraphs, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of
termination of the Merger Agreement or the Effective Time, Intersect ENT and its subsidiaries will not, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate or participate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries or
discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;
57TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or proposal reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, disclose or furnish any nonpublic information or data to any person concerning Intersect ENT’s
business or properties or afford any person other than Parent or its representatives access to its properties,
books or records, except as required by a governmental demand for information;
•
enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute, any agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal; or
•
approve, endorse, recommend or make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in
support of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal other than
with respect to the Merger or the Transactions.
However, these restrictions will not prohibit Intersect ENT or the Intersect ENT Board from taking and disclosing to
Intersect ENT’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder.
If at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the date on which holders of a majority of
Intersect ENT’s outstanding shares entitled to vote approve the Merger, Intersect ENT is contacted by a third party
expressing an interest in discussing an Acquisition Proposal or receives an Acquisition Proposal, in each case, that
is not the result of any material breach by Intersect ENT of the non-solicitation obligations of the Merger Agreement,
Intersect ENT and the Intersect ENT Board may participate or engage in negotiations, inquiries or discussions
(including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or disclose or furnish any nonpublic information and
data to, such third party (but only after such third party enters into a confidentiality agreement no less restrictive in
terms of confidentiality than the Confidentiality Agreement between Intersect ENT and Parent described below,
which may not provide for an exclusive right to negotiate with Intersect ENT) making such contact or making such
Acquisition Proposal and their respective representatives and potential sources of financing, if, and only if, prior to
the date on which the requisite shareholder vote is obtained, the Intersect ENT Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and the Intersect ENT Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with counsel, that failure to participate in such negotiations, inquiries or discussions, disclose or furnish
such information, would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of Intersect ENT’s directors under
applicable law, Intersect ENT will promptly (within 24 hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event
Intersect ENT receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for nonpublic information relating to Intersect
ENT or its subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business or, in the good faith
judgment of the Intersect ENT Board, unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal. Intersect ENT will (a) notify Parent in
writing promptly (within 24 hours) of any decision of the Intersect ENT Board as to whether to enter into discussions
or negotiations with any third parties concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to disclose or furnish nonpublic
information with respect to Intersect ENT or any of its subsidiaries, (b) provide Parent with written notice setting
forth all such information (including the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal) as is
reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and
of any material amendments thereto, (c) promptly provide Parent a copy of all written information provided by or on
behalf of such third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or provided by or on behalf of Intersect ENT
or its representatives to such third party (other than any information which has previously been made available to
Parent or its representatives), and (d) notify Parent promptly (within 24 hours) of any determination by the Intersect
ENT Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below). Intersect ENT and its
subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any third party subsequent to the date of the Merger Agreement
that restricts Intersect ENT’s ability to provide such information to Parent, and, if Intersect ENT is a party to any
agreement that prohibits Intersect ENT from providing such information to Parent, prior to providing nonpublic
information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with, the counterparty to such agreement, Intersect ENT
will obtain approval from the counterparty to such agreement to allow Intersect ENT to provide such information to
Parent.
A “Superior Proposal” is defined in the Merger Agreement to mean (i) an Acquisition Proposal to acquire (a)
beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the shares pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer or exchange offer or similar
transaction or series of related transactions involving Intersect ENT or (b) 50% or more of the assets of Intersect ENT
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) which the Intersect ENT Board determines, after

TABLE OF CONTENTS
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and after taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and all financial, legal, regulatory, and other aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal, is more favorable to Intersect ENT stockholders than the Transactions.
In the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT has agreed that neither the Intersect ENT Board nor any committee thereof
will, unless the Merger Agreement has been properly terminated (as described above under “Termination of the
Merger Agreement”), (a) withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its recommendation to Intersect ENT stockholders to approve the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and approve the Merger (the “Intersect ENT Board Recommendation”), (b) make any public
disclosure inconsistent with the Intersect ENT Board Recommendation, or, fail to reaffirm the Intersect ENT Board
Recommendation following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal within two business days of a
written request by Parent, (c) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal or (d) in the event of a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding shares, fail to
recommend against such tender offer or exchange offer within 10 business days of the commencement thereof (any
action referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) - (d) being referred to as a “Change of Recommendation”) or (e)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow Intersect ENT to enter into any
contract, agreement or understanding related to, intended to or reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, or requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph, prior to the date on which the requisite
shareholder vote is obtained, if the Intersect ENT Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor (in the case of clause (i) below) that (i) (x) a written Acquisition Proposal received
by Intersect ENT constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to violate the fiduciary duties of Intersect ENT’s directors under applicable law, or (ii) in the absence of an
Acquisition Proposal, due to events, facts or developments not known by Intersect ENT or, in the estimation of the
Intersect ENT Board, not reasonably likely to occur, as of the date of the Merger Agreement (which events, facts or
developments do not relate to (A) any Acquisition Proposal, (B) any events, facts or developments relating to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their affiliates, (C) clearance of the Merger under applicable antitrust laws or (D) the mere fact
that Intersect ENT meets or exceeds any internal or published financial or operating metrics or changes in the market
price or trading value of the shares or Intersect ENT’s credit rating (but not including the underlying cause thereof))
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of Intersect ENT’s
directors under applicable law, the Intersect ENT Board may:
(a)
make a Change of Recommendation; or
(b)
in the case of clause (i) above, terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal.
However, Intersect ENT may not terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to clause (b) unless, in advance of or
concurrently with such termination, Intersect ENT (1) pays the termination fee (described below) required by the
Merger Agreement, (2) simultaneously with such termination enters into a merger agreement, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, purchase agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) and (3) terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to clause (c)(ii) under
“Termination of the Merger Agreement” below. In addition, the Intersect ENT Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to clause (a) above or terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to clause (b) above
unless:
(1)
Intersect ENT will have provided prior written notice to Parent at least 5 calendar days in advance (the
“Notice Period”) of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal or otherwise make a
Change of Recommendation, which notice will specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) or the reasons for
such Change of Recommendation in the absence of a Superior Proposal, as the case may be;
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(2)
prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, Intersect ENT will, and will direct
its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement; and
(3)
following the Notice Period (and giving effect to any proposed adjustments to the terms of the Merger
Agreement) the Intersect ENT Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel (and financial advisor in the case of clause (i) only) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal or (ii) the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to violate the fiduciary duties of Intersect ENT’s directors under applicable law.
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal or material changes to the facts and circumstances
necessitating such Change of Recommendation after the start of the Notice Period, Intersect ENT is required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements described in clauses (1) through (3) above
with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period will be deemed to have recommenced on the date of
such new notice, but with respect to any such notices references to a period of “5 calendar days” are replaced with
references to “3 calendar days.” Any Change of Recommendation will not change the approval of the Intersect ENT
Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other law to be inapplicable to the Transactions,
including the Merger.

For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the applicable
employee’s employment with Parent or Surviving Corporation), Parent will provide, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to (i) each employee of Intersect ENT or any of its subsidiaries who remains in the
employment of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or their respective subsidiaries) following the Effective Time (the
“Continuing Employees”) with a base salary or wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity that is no less in
the aggregate than the base salary or wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity in effect for each such
Continuing Employee immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) Continuing Employees employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.
To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate in its or its
affiliate’s employee benefit plans, programs or policies following the Effective Time and subject to applicable law and
the terms of the applicable plan, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, recognize
the prior service with Intersect ENT or any of its subsidiaries of each Continuing Employee for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and determination of level of benefits in any employee benefit plans, programs or policies of
Parent or its affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate (but not (i) for purposes of vesting in
stock options and other equity awards, (ii) for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan,
(iii) to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits, or (iv) to the extent that such
recognition is prohibited by law).
From and after the Effective Time, and subject to applicable law and the terms of the applicable plan or operating plan
guidelines, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans
of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the
extent such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable benefit plans of Intersect ENT as of the time
immediately preceding the Effective Time.
No provision of the Merger Agreement will (i) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, (ii) limit or prohibit Parent or any of its affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, from
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan, including any benefit plan of Intersect ENT or (iii) require Parent
or any of its affiliates to employ or engage any Continuing Employee or other individual for any period of time. The
provisions described above are solely for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and Intersect ENT, and no provision of
the Merger Agreement, express or implied, confers upon any other person any rights or remedies, including any right

whatsoever.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Intersect ENT is required to
submit a proposal to our stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to Intersect ENT’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger Agreement and the Transactions. This compensation is summarized in the section captioned “The Merger-
Interests of Intersect ENT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 37 of this proxy
statement. The Intersect ENT Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related
compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, Intersect ENT is asking you to approve the
following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Intersect ENT approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation
that will or may become payable to Intersect ENT’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled ‘The Merger-Interests of
Intersect ENT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger’.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote
not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is
advisory only, it will not be binding on Intersect ENT. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the
Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless
of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.

Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
outstanding shares of Intersect ENT’s common stock representing a majority of the voting power of such
outstanding shares present at the meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum
is present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal, (ii) abstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a
vote against the Compensation Proposal and (iii) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of
the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Intersect ENT common stock represented by properly executed, timely
received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If an Intersect
ENT stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of
Intersect ENT common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Intersect
ENT Board.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and
any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including
solicitation proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against
adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that,
even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement
such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting
without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change
their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special
Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the tenth day on which public

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2020;
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other
communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the
Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as
approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the medical technology industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and
analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition
the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor
does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the
$28.25 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and
our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any
other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the
Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by,
the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness
of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $28.25 in cash per
Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or
otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or, as to the
potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent, or the Transaction, or
as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or the ability of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this
opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and
the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the
Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter.
This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.

agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than
2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the
stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms

267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for
the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed.]
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the
provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as is practicable.

common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”)
that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.4, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, payable to the

receive an amount in cash, payable to the holder thereon, without any interest thereon, equal to the Common
Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by a factor of 1,000 (the “Preferred Stock Merger Consideration”, taken
together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”).
(e) If at any time between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time any change in the number of
outstanding Shares shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution
with a record date during such period, other than the Merger, the amount of the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.1(d) shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

(a) Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock in connection with
the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive the consideration to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.1(d).
At or prior to the Closing, the Parent shall deliver, in trust, to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash hereinafter referred to as “Consideration Fund”). In the event
the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by
Section 2.1 (including with respect to former Dissenting Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL), the Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional
funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments.
(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time),
the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal, in
customary form, that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration in customary form. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant
to the provisions of this ARTICLE II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid to holders of Shares in connection with, or accrued on, the Merger Consideration. If any Merger
Consideration is to be paid to any natural person or any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
association, trust or other entity or organization, including any Governmental Entity (“Person”) other than a
Person in whose name the Shares are registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Shares, or shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
one or more Book Entry
A-3TABLE OF CONTENTS
Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of
such evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each such Share and the Book Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.
(c) The Consideration Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in excess of the amounts payable to Company Stockholders
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve
the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this
ARTICLE II, and following any losses from any such investment, the Parent shall promptly provide additional
cash funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Company Stockholder at the Effective Time in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.
(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
the shares of Company Common Stock or Series D Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE II, except as otherwise provided by Law.
(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
unclaimed by the former Company Stockholders six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied
with this ARTICLE II with respect to such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person
in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not
theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. If any Certificate or Book
Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.
(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
(such affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this ARTICLE II.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than as provided in Section 2.3(b), any
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Company
Stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration unless and until such Company Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholder’s right to obtain payment of the

fair value of such stockholder’s Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, but shall instead be entitled only to such
rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such stockholder under the DGCL. From and
after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the
payment of dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments, notices, petitions,
or other communication received from stockholders or provided to stockholders by the Company with respect to
any Dissenting Shares or shares claimed to be Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior
written consent of the Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or

1","Section 3.9 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.
(a) Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of each material
Benefit Plan. With respect to each material Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent a true and
complete copy of each of the following, together with all amendments thereto: (i) all plan documents embodying
the Benefit Plan (or, where a Benefit Plan has not been reduced to writing, a summary of all material Benefit Plan
terms), (ii) in the case of any funded Benefit Plan, the trust agreement or similar instrument, (iii) for each Benefit
Plan subject to the requirement that annual reports be filed on a Form 5500, the two most recently filed annual
reports, with schedules, financial statements and auditor’s opinion attached, (iv) in the case of each Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter
applicable to the Benefit Plan, (v) all related custodial agreements, insurance policies (including fiduciary liability
insurance covering the fiduciaries of the Benefit Plan), administrative services and similar agreements, and
investment advisory or investment management agreements, if any, (vi) the most recent summary plan
description and summaries of material modifications or any similar summary and any employee handbook
referencing the Benefit Plan and (vii) copies of all material correspondence (including any applications or
submissions under any voluntary correction programs) with any Governmental Entity relating to any Benefit
Plan within the preceding three (3) years.
(b) No Benefit Plan is and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that together
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or at any relevant time was treated as a single employer under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, together with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, an
“ERISA Affiliate”) has ever contributed or been required to contribute to, or has ever sponsored, maintained or
participated in, (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA),
or (iii) a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which an ERISA
Affiliate could reasonably be expected to incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the
Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has, prior to the Agreement Date,
incurred any liability or obligation on account of a “partial withdrawal” or a “complete withdrawal” (within the
meaning of Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from, or otherwise in respect of, any multiemployer plan that has
not been satisfied in full. No event has occurred and no condition exists that is likely to subject the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates to any material liability under Title IV of ERISA.
(c) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is covered by a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). No such determination
or opinion letter has been revoked, and, to the Company’s Knowledge, revocation has not been threatened. To
the Company’s Knowledge, no such Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most
recent determination or opinion letter in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification.
(d) Each Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms. Each Benefit Plan, including any associated trust or fund, has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws (including, where applicable, non-U.S. Laws), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing
has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably
A-11TABLE OF CONTENTS
be expected to subject the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any material liability or Tax under applicable Law.
All material filings and reports with respect to each Benefit Plan required to have been submitted to the IRS, the
United States Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity have been duly and timely submitted.
(e) No Benefit Plan provides health, welfare, or life insurance benefits following retirement or other termination
of employment, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to provide any such
benefits following retirement or other termination of employment, in each case except for benefit continuation
coverage to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any
similar Law for which the participant pays the full costs of coverage.
(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan, there is no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
lawsuit, claim, administrative investigation, action, inquiry, audit or other proceeding by the IRS, U.S.
Department of Labor or other Governmental Entity, and no other lawsuit, claim, action, inquiry, voluntary
compliance request, proceeding or other controversy, other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary
course and proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations orders, is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened.
(g) With respect to each Benefit Plan, all contributions (including salary reduction contributions), premiums
and other payments and contributions (i) to the extent due, have been timely made, and (ii) to the extent not yet
due, have been appropriately accrued on the books of the Company or, if applicable, its Subsidiaries.
(h) Each Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”) has been documented and
operated in all material respects in compliance with Section 409A.
(i) Except for the Benefit Plans listed in Section 3.9(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Benefit Plan is
subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America, whether or not United States Law
also applies (each, a “Non-U.S. Benefit Plan”). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands and the Virgin Islands shall be considered
jurisdictions other than the United States. No Non-U.S. Benefit Plan provides for benefits that exceed the
statutory minimum benefits required to be provided by the applicable jurisdiction other than the United States.
There is no Non-U.S. Benefit Plan in the nature of a defined benefit plan or multiemployer plan for the benefit of
any Person in, or subject to any legal requirements of, a jurisdiction other than the United States. Each Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan (i) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment under applicable Law, satisfies all requirements to
obtain such tax treatment, (ii) if required to be funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is
funded, book-reserved, or secured by such an insurance policy, as applicable, based on reasonable and
appropriate actuarial assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting principles and in compliance and
accordance with applicable Law, and (iii) is not subject to any funding deficiency.
(j) Each Benefit Plan and its related documentation or agreement, summary plan description, or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms expressly and adequately reserves the right to
amend and terminate such Benefit Plan, and each Benefit Plan may be terminated without material liability to the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate, except for vested benefits accrued through the date of termination and the
administrative and professional costs incurred in such transaction. No Benefit Plan subject to ERISA includes in
its assets any securities issued by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.
(k) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions, either alone
or in combination with another event, including a termination of employment or service, will: (i) entitle any
Covered Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof to any severance pay, unemployment compensation
or any other payment; (ii) result in or accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, or otherwise increase, any
amounts due to any Covered Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof under any Benefit Plan or
require any such plan to be funded, or (iii) result in any payment or benefit that would constitute an “excess
parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated to “gross up” or reimburse any Tax incurred by any Person pursuant to Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of
the Code or otherwise.

ARTICLE VII (i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate, or participate or engage in any
negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or proposal reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, disclose or furnish any

Person other than the Parent or its Representatives access to its properties, books, or records, except as
required by a governmental demand for information, (iii) enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or
execute, any agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, endorse, recommend or make or
authorize any statement, recommendation, or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or
proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal other than with respect to the Merger or the Transactions (other
than any confidential statement, recommendation or solicitation by and among the Company, the Company
Board and their Representatives); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company may refer any third party to this Section 5.3. The Company will, and will direct its Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the
Agreement Date regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time following the
Agreement Date and prior to the date on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained the Company is
contacted by any third party expressing an interest in discussing an Acquisition Proposal or receives an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case, that is not the result of the Company having materially breached Section
5.3(a), the Company and the Company Board may participate or engage in negotiations, inquiries or discussions
(including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or disclose or furnish any nonpublic information
and data to, any Person or Persons (but only after any such Person enters into a confidentiality agreement, that
is no less restrictive in terms of confidentiality than, the Confidentiality Agreement, with the Company which
may not provide for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from
complying with this Section 5.3(b)) making such contact or making such Acquisition Proposal and their
respective Representatives and potential sources of financing, if, and only if, prior to the date on which the
Company Requisite Vote is obtained the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors, that such Person or Persons have submitted to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with counsel, that the failure to participate in such negotiations, inquiries or
discussions, disclose or furnish such information, would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties
of the Company’s directors under applicable Law.
(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) notify the Parent in writing of the receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for
information in the ordinary course of business or, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, unrelated
to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify the Parent, in writing, of any decision of the Company
Board as to whether to enter into discussions or negotiations with any third parties concerning any Acquisition
Proposal or to disclose or furnish nonpublic information with respect to

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such determination was reached (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after
such determination was reached). The Company will (i) provide the Parent with written notice setting forth all
such information (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal) as is reasonably
necessary to keep the Parent informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and of
any material amendments thereto, (ii) promptly provide the Parent a copy of all written information provided by
or on behalf of such Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or provided by or on behalf of the
Company or its Representatives to such Person (other than any information which has previously been made
available to Parent or its Representatives), and (iii) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
such determination) notify the Parent of any determination by the Company Board that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date that would restrict the Company’s
ability to provide to Parent the information set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above, and, if the Company is a party
to any agreement that would prohibit the Company from providing such information to Parent, prior to providing
non-public information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with, the counterparty to such agreement,
the Company will obtain approval from the counterparty to such agreement to allow the Company to provide
such information to Parent.
(d) Subject to Section 5.3(e) and 5.3(f), unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (w)
withdraw, qualify, or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify (other than in any confidential
communication by and among the Company, the Company Board and their Representatives), in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (x) make any public disclosure
inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation, or, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal within two (2) Business Days of a written
request by Parent, (y) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt, or recommend (other than

recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding (x) constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (y) requiring it to
abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the Transactions.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the
Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor (in the case of clause (i) below) that (i) (x) a written Acquisition Proposal received
by the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the Company’s directors under applicable Law, or (ii) in the absence of
an Acquisition Proposal, due to events, facts or developments not known by the Company or, in the Company
Board’s estimation, not reasonably likely to occur (or the consequences of which were not known by the
Company or, in the Company Board’s estimation, not reasonably likely to occur) as of the Agreement Date
(which events, facts or developments do not relate to (A) any Acquisition Proposal, (B) any events, facts or
developments relating to the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, (C) clearance of the Merger under any
applicable Antitrust Laws or (D) the mere fact that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for
any period ending on or after the Agreement Date or changes in the market price or trading value of the Shares
or the credit rating for the Company (but not including the underlying cause thereof)), the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the Company’s directors under applicable
Law, (1) make a Change of Recommendation, or (2) in the case of clause (i) above, terminate this Agreement to

(2) shall be void and of no force or effect unless, in advance of or concurrently with such termination, the
Company (A) pays the Termination Fee as required by Section 7.2, (B) simultaneously with such termination
enters into a merger agreement, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, purchase agreement or other
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (the “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) and (C)
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); provided further, that the Company Board may not
effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to the foregoing clause (2) unless (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent at least
five (5) calendar days in advance (the “Notice Period”) of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise make a Change of Recommendation, which notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal) or the reasons for such Change of Recommendation in the absence of a Superior Proposal, as the case
may be, (B) prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall direct
its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with the Parent in good faith (to the extent
the Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (C)
following the Notice Period (and giving effect to any proposed adjustments to the terms of this Agreement) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel (and financial advisor
in the case of clause (i) below) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or (ii) the failure to
make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the
Company’s directors under applicable Law. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal or
material changes to the facts and circumstances necessitating such Change of Recommendation after the start
of the Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this Section 5.3(e) with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall be
deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, but with respect to any such notices references
herein to a period of “five (5) calendar days” shall be deemed references to a period of “three (3) calendar days”.
Any Change of Recommendation shall not change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other Law to be inapplicable to the Transactions, including the Merger.
(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-
2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder; provided that nothing in this clause (f) shall alter the consequences of a
Change of Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate statement that describes the
Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

provide satisfactory responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the
SEC, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable after
the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon, or that the Company may commence

8.12(a), subject to Section 7.2(b), each party may pursue any other remedy available to it at Law or in equity,
including monetary damages (in the case of the Company) based on the consideration that would otherwise
