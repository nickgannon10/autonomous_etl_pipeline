Sierra Oncology is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, on a mission to deliver targeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer. Sierra’s
main focus is the development and potential commercialization of momelotinib, an investigational agent for the treatment of myelofibrosis. In

symptomatic and anemic and previously treated with an approved JAK inhibitor called MOMENTUM. In addition to momelotinib, Sierra’s pipeline
consists of two assets in Phase I, SRA515 and SRA737. SRA515 is a selective bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) bromodomain and extra-
terminal domain (BET) inhibitor with a novel bivalent binding mode that inhibits both protein bromodomains, and SRA737 is a novel checkpoint
kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (which
we refer to as the “DGCL”), at the effective time of the merger: (1) Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Sierra Oncology; (2) the separate
existence of Acquisition Sub will cease; and (3) Sierra Oncology will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of GSK. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to refer to Sierra Oncology as the surviving
corporation following the merger.
As a result of the merger, Sierra Oncology will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares
of capital stock of the surviving corporation as a result of the merger.
The time at which the merger becomes effective (which we refer to as the “effective time of the merger”) will occur upon the filing of a
certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as Sierra Oncology,
GSK and Acquisition Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).",10,10

(4) held by stockholders who have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(which shares of our common stock we refer to collectively as the “excluded shares”)) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to
receive $55.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this amount as the “per share price.”
At or prior to the closing of the merger, GSK will cause a sufficient amount of cash to be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the
aggregate amount of the merger consideration. Once our stockholders have provided the payment agent with the documentation required by the
payment agent, the payment agent will pay the stockholder the per share price in exchange for each share of our common stock held by that
stockholder. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and
Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

instruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares). We elected to use a virtual meeting given the current
health and travel implications of COVID-19 and our desire to promote the health and welfare of our stockholders, as well as our positive experiences
with virtual meetings. Additionally, the virtual nature of the special meeting is generally designed to enable participation of and access by more of
our stockholders while decreasing the cost of conducting the special meeting.
Purpose
At the special meeting, we will ask stockholders to consider and vote on proposals to: (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with

of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,

value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment,
compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash

surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a
written demand for appraisal to Sierra Oncology before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or
by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the
effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow
exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss
appraisal proceedings in respect of Sierra Oncology unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal, as described
further below. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement,

From the date of the merger agreement until either the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms or the effective time of
the merger, Sierra Oncology has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted with any person
and its representatives relating to an acquisition proposal.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sierra Oncology has agreed that it will not, and its subsidiaries, affiliates and any director, executive
officer, outside legal counsel or affiliate of Sierra Oncology will not, and it will not authorize or direct any of its representatives to:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any
acquisition proposal or any proposals that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
•
furnish to any person (other than GSK, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective representatives) any non-public information relating
to Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person (other than GSK, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
representatives) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of
Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case in connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or the making of any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
9Table of Contents
•
participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any third person with respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to
any inquiries from third persons relating to the making of an acquisition proposal; or
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an
acquisition transaction, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement (we refer to any of these as an “alternative acquisition
agreement”).
However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, Sierra Oncology and the Sierra Oncology Board may, directly or
indirectly through one or more of their representatives (including its financial advisor), subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement, (1)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; or (2) (a) furnish any non-public information relating to Sierra Oncology or any of its
subsidiaries to; or (b) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information or to any personnel of Sierra
Oncology or any of its subsidiaries to any person or its representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to Sierra Oncology a written acquisition
proposal after date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in breach of the applicable restrictions. Sierra Oncology may do this only if the
Sierra Oncology Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such acquisition
proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to take such actions would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Acquisition Proposals.”
In addition, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, Sierra Oncology may terminate the merger agreement in order
to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement for a superior proposal if the Sierra Oncology Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties. Sierra Oncology is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal (as described
below) unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with GSK during a
specified period. If Sierra Oncology terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from a third party it must pay a
termination fee to GSK. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—The Sierra Oncology
Board’s Recommendation; Board Recommendation Change.”",17,18

The Sierra Oncology Board may not withdraw its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take certain similar
actions other than, under certain circumstances, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Sierra Oncology Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law
and the Sierra Oncology Board complies with the terms of the merger agreement.
Moreover, the Sierra Oncology Board cannot withdraw its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take certain
similar actions unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with GSK during a
specified period. If Sierra Oncology or GSK terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including because the Sierra Oncology
Board withdraws its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement, then Sierra Oncology must pay to GSK a termination fee.

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Sierra Oncology and GSK. Upon valid termination of the merger agreement under
specified circumstances, Sierra Oncology will be required to pay GSK (or its designee) a termination fee of $70,000,000. Specifically, this termination
fee will be payable by Sierra Oncology to GSK if the merger agreement is terminated:

by GSK, if the Sierra Oncology Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger;
•
by GSK, if a willful and material breach of Sierra Oncology’s non-solicitation restrictions in the merger agreement has occurred; or
•
by Sierra Oncology, if Sierra Oncology enters into an alternative acquisition agreement.

The termination fee will also be payable in certain circumstances if:
•

conditions related to the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and the
absence of any order, injunction, legal restraint or law that prevents or materially impairs the consummation of the merger are satisfied;
(2) because of Sierra Oncology’s failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders; or (3) subject to a 30-day cure period,
because Sierra Oncology breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants in a manner that would cause the
related closing conditions to not be satisfied; and
•

Oncology’s stock or assets is publicly announced or publicly disclosed by a third party (or, in the case of a termination because Sierra
Oncology has breached its covenants, disclosed to the Sierra Oncology Board) and not withdrawn and within one year of such
termination Sierra Oncology enters into a definitive agreement providing for, an acquisition transaction involving the acquisition of at
least 50 percent of its stock or assets that is subsequently consummated.
The merger agreement also provides that Sierra Oncology, on one hand, or GSK and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, may specifically
enforce the obligations under the merger agreement.

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the special
meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in this
proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On April 13, 2022, we announced that Sierra Oncology entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, GSK will acquire Sierra
Oncology for $55.00 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete the merger, our stockholders holding a majority of all of our issued
and outstanding common stock must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation
of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.” The Sierra
Oncology Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of our common stock in connection with the
solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, the special meeting
and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock
without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.
Q:
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Sierra Oncology?
A:
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Sierra Oncology by GSK. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders
and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Sierra Oncology,
with Sierra Oncology continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. As a result of the merger, Sierra Oncology will become an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of GSK, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq. In addition, our
common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $55.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of our common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal
rights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you
will receive $5,500.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the per share price compare to the market price of Sierra Oncology’s common stock?
A:
This amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 39 percent to the closing price of our common stock on April 12, 2022, which was the last
full trading day before public announcement of the transaction; and (2) a premium of approximately 63 percent to the VWAP of our common stock
over the 30 trading days ending April 12, 2022.
14Table of Contents
Q:
What will happen to Sierra Oncology warrants?
A:
At the effective time of the merger and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, each Series A warrant that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and extinguished and represent only the right of the holder thereof to
receive an amount in cash (less any required withholding and other taxes), without interest, equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in such
Series A warrant), which is calculated under the terms of the Series A warrants to be $45.98 per share of our common stock subject to the Series A
warrants.
At the effective time of the merger and upon the terms, each pre-funded warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be deemed exercised in full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the pre-funded warrants) effective upon the effective time of the
merger, in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (less any
required withholding and other taxes), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the amount of the per share price by (2) the
number of shares of common stock deemed to be issuable upon exercise in full of the pre-funded warrant as a “cashless exercise” calculated in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the pre-funded warrants.
At the effective time of the merger, any outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of Sierra Oncology with a per share exercise price greater
than the per share price will be cancelled and extinguished without any cash payment in respect thereof.
Q:
What will happen to Sierra Oncology equity-based awards and Sierra options?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger all Sierra options that are outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will accelerate vesting in full and will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share of such option,
and (2) the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Sierra option. The number of shares of our common stock
issuable for Sierra options subject to performance-based vesting that have performance periods outstanding at the effective time will be deemed to
be the number of shares issuable upon satisfaction of maximum achievement of performance criteria. The cash payment amount (less any required
withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable Sierra option holder following the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement. Sierra options with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the per share price will be cancelled without
any cash payment in respect thereof.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?

Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
All of our stockholders as of the close of business on May 11, 2022, which is the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to vote their shares
of our common stock at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 24,419,349 shares of our common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one vote
per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to adopt the
merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote at the
special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by
Sierra Oncology to its named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast for or against on the
proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast for or against the proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote at the
special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting,
except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on these proposals, except to the extent that such failure affects
obtaining a quorum at the meeting. In all cases, abstentions will have no effect on these proposals.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement
carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date and return, as promptly
as possible, the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or grant your proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your

Table of Contents
Q:
How does the Sierra Oncology Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Sierra Oncology Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation
that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment
of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of our common stock at this time. Instead: (1) Sierra Oncology will remain an independent public company; (2) our
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Sierra Oncology will be required to pay GSK (or its designee) a termination
fee.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Remedies.”
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is certain
compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of Sierra Oncology’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying
plans and arrangements that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by GSK or its affiliates (including, following
the consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to our named executive officers in connection with or following the merger is not
subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 2: Approval, on a Non-Binding,
Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Sierra Oncology is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra
Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra
Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not required to consummate the merger.
Q:
What will happen if Sierra Oncology’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to its
named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is
not a condition to consummation of the merger. This is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Sierra Oncology or GSK. The underlying plans
and arrangements providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger will or may be paid to Sierra Oncology’s named executive
officers even if our stockholders do not approve such compensation.

Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have
been sent directly to you by or on behalf of Sierra Oncology. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares
at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of our common stock held in
“street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you
by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner,
you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also
invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting
unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special
meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the
proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment proposal, except to the extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience);
•
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
•
by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of our common stock and to
confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is
no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common stock by proxy. If you are a
stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of our common stock
at the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will
revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Table of Contents
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker
or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. However, because
you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
May I attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting?
A:
Yes. You may attend the special meeting via a live interactive webcast on the internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SRRA2022SM. You
will be able to listen to the special meeting live and vote online. The special meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on June 29, 2022. Online
check-in will begin a few minutes prior to the special meeting. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form
in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares). As the special meeting is virtual, there will be no physical meeting
location.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, we encourage you to sign, date
and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet
or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card). If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you
provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. Otherwise, you
should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be considered at the special meeting without
your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be counted for purposes of a quorum or voted at the meeting, which will have the
same effect as voting against the adoption of the merger agreement.
Q:
Why did Sierra Oncology choose to hold a virtual special meeting?
A:
The Sierra Oncology Board decided to hold the special meeting virtually given the current health and travel implications of COVID-19 and our
desire to promote the health and welfare of our stockholders, as well as our positive experiences with virtual meetings. Additionally, the virtual
nature of the special meeting is generally designed to enable participation of and access by more of our stockholders while decreasing the cost of
conducting the special meeting.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy
to vote your shares of our common stock is called a “proxy card.” You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by
telephone or by the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Stephen Dilly, Christina Thomson, and
Kevin Norrett, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special meeting.

Table of Contents
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy and by the applicable
deadline;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary prior to the special meeting; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding
how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving
you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares in the way that
you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the Sierra Oncology Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will
be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to
send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented
by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash
payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you hold your shares of our common stock in
book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead the payment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger
consideration upon receipt of a customary “agent’s message” and any other items specified by the payment agent.
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective date of the merger. If you sell or
transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a
proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies Sierra Oncology in writing of such
special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger is completed, to the person
to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your
shares of our
20
Table of Contents
common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for
your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card).
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy card and voting instruction form
that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than
one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting
materials that you receive.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
If available, Sierra Oncology may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Sierra Oncology intends to publish
final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Sierra Oncology files
with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
our common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger
unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.
Both U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders may also potentially be subject to backup withholding tax if they do not provide certain tax certifications,
as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.”
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances, as well as any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-
income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information purposes only and
does not constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is
provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2022 or before. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,
cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our
control.
21
Table of Contents
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has
expired or been terminated.
The initial waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 31, 2022.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their
shares of our common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions
and statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal,
will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders
will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be
fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving
corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such
entry of judgment. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
additional detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached
as Annex B to this proxy statement.
Q:
Do any of Sierra Oncology’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Sierra Oncology stockholders
generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3)
unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Sierra Oncology Board was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of Sierra Oncology’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts,
including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the merger. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of
forward-looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,”
“forecast” and other words of similar import. Our stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-
K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:
•
the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or the failure to satisfy the other
conditions to the completion of the merger, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary
regulatory approval;
•
the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay a termination fee;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement;
•
risks that the merger affects our current operations or our ability to retain or recruit employees;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share price will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that, if the merger is completed, our stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful
execution of Sierra Oncology’s current strategy as an independent company;
•
the possibility that Sierra Oncology could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including licensing, partnership, collaboration
or other strategic transactions, including the acquisition of Sierra Oncology or some or all of Sierra Oncology’s assets by one or more as yet
unknown purchasers;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Sierra Oncology is restrained from soliciting other acquisition proposals during the
pendency of the merger;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, operating results and business generally,
including risks related to the diversion of the attention of Sierra Oncology management or employees during the pendency of the merger;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;
•
the risk that the proposed merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, exceeding the expected costs of the merger;
•
the risk that our stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the merger and may decline significantly if the merger is not completed;
and
•
risks related to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval to the merger.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information contained or incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement, including: (1) the information contained under this caption; and (2) information in our most recent filings on Form 10-
K and Form 10-Q, including the information contained under the caption “Risk Factors,” and information in our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking
statements.

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Our stockholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that we make on related subjects as may be
detailed in our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record date. Adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the
merger.
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast for or against the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast for or against the proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and will have no effect on: (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become
payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later
date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because
the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any
“broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there
are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on: (1)
the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient

The Sierra Oncology Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and its stockholders; and

In addition to the proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement and (2) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or
may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, our stockholders are also being asked to approve
a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional votes or proxies in favor of the proposal

present, the chairperson of the special meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may
adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. The
chairperson may also adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time, even if a quorum is present. In addition, the special meeting could be postponed
before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, our stockholders who have already
submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before they are voted at the special meeting.

We currently expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2022 or before. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,
cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their
shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements
described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of
their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to seek appraisal of their
shares by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective
date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge)
as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded
quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each
stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value
of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation
is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek
appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a written
demand for appraisal to Sierra Oncology before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in
favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the effective time of
the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in
respect of Sierra Oncology unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL
for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the
DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your

Parties Involved in the Merger
Sierra Oncology, Inc.
Sierra Oncology is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, on a mission to deliver targeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer. Sierra’s main
focus is the development and potential commercialization of momelotinib, an investigational agent for the treatment of myelofibrosis. In January 2022,
Sierra Oncology announced positive topline results from its global Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis who are symptomatic and anemic
and previously treated with an approved JAK inhibitor called MOMENTUM. In addition to momelotinib, Sierra’s pipeline consists of two assets in Phase
I, SRA515 and SRA737. SRA515 is a selective bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitor with a
novel bivalent binding mode that inhibits both protein bromodomains, and SRA737 is a novel checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor.
Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “SRRA.” Sierra’s corporate offices are located at 1820 Gateway Drive, Suite 110, San
Mateo, California 94404, and its telephone number is (650) 376-8679.
GlaxoSmithKline plc
GSK is a global consumer healthcare and pharmaceuticals business that develops and delivers medicines, vaccines, and consumer healthcare
products that impact human health at scale. GSK’s operations span the value chain from identifying, researching, developing and testing ground-
breaking discoveries, to regulatory approval, manufacturing and commercialization.
GSK’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GSK.” GSK’s corporate offices are located at 980 Great West
Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS England, and its phone number is +44 20 8047 5000.
Orikum Acquisition Inc.
Acquisition Sub is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GSK and was formed on April 7, 2022, solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Acquisition Sub has not engaged in any business activities other than as incidental to its formation
and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and arranging of the equity financing and any debt financing in
connection with the merger. Upon completion of the merger, Acquisition Sub will cease to exist and Sierra Oncology will continue as the surviving
corporation.
Acquisition Sub’s address is FMC Tower at Cira Center South, 2929 Walnut Street, Suite 1700, Philadelphia, PA 19104.
Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, (1)
Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Sierra Oncology; (2) the separate
32Table of Contents
existence of Acquisition Sub will cease; and (3) Sierra Oncology will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and as an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of GSK.
As a result of the merger, Sierra Oncology will cease to be a publicly traded company, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and
deregistered under the Exchange Act and Sierra Oncology will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the merger is completed, you will not own
any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.
The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, GSK and Acquisition Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).
Effect on Sierra Oncology if the Merger is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, (1) Sierra Oncology will remain an independent public
company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to
file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that: (1) our management will continue to operate the business as
it is currently being operated; and (2) our stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject,
including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Sierra Oncology operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not to be completed, the price of our
common stock may decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future value of your shares of our common stock.
If the merger is not completed, the Sierra Oncology Board will continue to evaluate and review, among other things, Sierra Oncology’s business,
operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted by our
stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Sierra Oncology’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely
impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the transaction is terminated, Sierra Oncology will be required to pay GSK (or its designee) the applicable
termination fee.
Per Share Price
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger:
•
each share of our common stock that is (1) held by Sierra Oncology as treasury stock; (2) owned by GSK or Acquisition Sub; or (3) owned
by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GSK or Acquisition Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor; and
•
each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than the
shares identified in the prior bullet and shares of our common stock held by our stockholders who have (1) neither voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing; and (2) properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such shares in accordance with the DGCL) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the per share price.
At or prior to the closing of the merger, GSK will cause a sufficient amount of cash to be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the
aggregate amount of the merger consideration. Once a stockholder has
33
Table of Contents
provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with
respect to book-entry shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment agent, then the payment agent will pay the
stockholder the per share price in exchange for each share of our common stock held by that stockholder. For more information, see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, each of our stockholders will have the right to receive the per share price for each share of our common stock that
such stockholder owned, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares,” but will no
longer have any rights as a Sierra Oncology stockholder (except that our stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly
withdraw or subsequently lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares, determined pursuant to an
appraisal proceeding contemplated by the DGCL as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Appraisal Rights”).",40,42
"Sierra Oncology, Inc._20220516_DEFM14A_20099747_4463777.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Sierra Oncology Board, together with Sierra Oncology management, regularly evaluates Sierra Oncology’s business strategy, short-term and
long-term business objectives and financial needs with a view towards enhancing stockholder value and furthering Sierra Oncology’s mission to deliver
targeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer. As part of this evaluation, the Sierra Oncology Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of
strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) continued investment in the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of
Sierra Oncology’s existing product candidates; (2) opportunities for strategic partnerships, collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with
third parties with respect to the development and potential commercialization of product candidates, either by Sierra Oncology with respect to new
product candidates or by third party pharmaceutical companies with respect to Sierra Oncology’s existing product candidates; (3) various capital raising
alternatives, including private and public equity and debt financing transactions; and (4) various other financial and strategic alternatives, including a
sale of Sierra Oncology or certain of its assets.
As part of its business strategy, Sierra Oncology’s management has from time to time engaged in discussions with participants in the
pharmaceutical industry regarding opportunities for strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib, in particular in
jurisdictions outside of the United States. Sierra Oncology management regularly updates the Sierra Oncology Board on opportunities and significant
discussions regarding potential strategic partnerships. Sierra Oncology and the counterparties have entered into confidentiality agreements to facilitate
these discussions which have not included a “standstill” or other restriction on the counterparty’s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire
Sierra Oncology.
In December 2021, Sierra Oncology engaged Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (which we refer to as “Lazard Frères”) and Lazard & Co., Limited (which we
refer to collectively with Lazard Frères as “Lazard”) for Lazard to act as financial advisory investment banker to Sierra Oncology in connection with the
possible sale of Sierra Oncology or another possible licensing, partnership or similar transaction involving Sierra Oncology’s product candidates. The
Sierra Oncology Board approved the terms of the engagement. The Sierra Oncology Board determined to engage Lazard as financial advisor in
connection with Sierra Oncology’s evaluation of potential strategic alternatives after considering Lazard’s qualifications, independence, expertise,
international reputation, knowledge of the biopharmaceutical industry and experience acting as financial advisor in connection with similar partnership
and strategic transactions. As part of the Sierra Oncology Board’s evaluation of strategic alternatives, Lazard had previously and from time-to-time
reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board its preliminary market and valuation perspectives with respect to Sierra Oncology and the biopharmaceutical
industry generally, as well potential counterparties for a partnership or other strategic transaction involving Sierra Oncology.
34Table of Contents
In January 2022, in order to facilitate the Sierra Oncology Board’s assistance and oversight of Sierra Oncology management in connection with the
evaluation and pursuit of strategic transactions, the Sierra Oncology Board established two separate committees of the Sierra Oncology Board, one to
review, evaluate and negotiate, on behalf of the Sierra Oncology Board, potential strategies which could include a merger, sale, business combination or
other transaction (which we refer to as the “Strategic Transactions Committee”) and another to review, evaluate and negotiate, on behalf of the Sierra
Oncology Board, one or more transactions involving the incurrence of debt and/or sale of equity securities by Sierra Oncology (which we refer to as the
“Financing Committee”). The Strategic Transactions Committee and the Financing Committee were formed in light of (1) the potentially significant
workload that could be involved in any decision by Sierra Oncology to evaluate applicable strategic or financing transactions; (2) the possibility that
Sierra Oncology management may need feedback and direction on relatively short notice; and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of
directors oversee any process of considering applicable strategic alternatives. Gaurav Aggarwal, Mona Ashiya, Craig Collard, Georgia Erbez and Robert
Pelzer were appointed by the Sierra Oncology Board as members of the Strategic Transactions Committee, and Andrew Allen, Jeffrey Cooper, Christy
Oliger, Josh Richardson (who resigned from the Sierra Oncology Board on March 6, 2022) and Andrew Sinclair were appointed by the Sierra Oncology
Board as members of the Financing Committee. The Sierra Oncology Board resolved that it would not effectuate a merger, sale, business combination or
other transaction if it had not first been approved or recommended by the Strategic Transactions Committee, or effectuate a transaction involving the
incurrence of debt and/or sale of equity securities by Sierra Oncology if it had not first been approved or recommended by the Financing Committee. It
was understood that the full Board would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., Sierra Oncology’s outside counsel (which we refer to as “Wilson Sonsini”), reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board its
fiduciary duties in connection with these matters.
On January 25, 2022, Sierra Oncology announced that momelotinib achieved statistically significant benefit on symptoms, anemia and splenic size
in the pivotal Phase 3 MOMENTUM study for myelofibrosis. Sierra Oncology further noted it planned to submit a New Drug Application (a “NDA”) with
the US Food & Drug Administration for momelotinib in the second quarter of 2022.
Also on January 25, 2022, Sierra Oncology announced a proposed underwritten public offering of Sierra Oncology common stock and pre-funded
warrants that ultimately raised $145.3 million. Sierra Oncology effected the offering to continue financing its preparation for the potential
commercialization of momelotinib, clinical development of its other product candidates, research, clinical and process development and manufacturing of
its product candidates, working capital, and capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
Following the announcement of the MOMENTUM clinical data for momelotinib, Sierra Oncology management met with various participants in the
pharmaceutical industry with which it had been engaged in discussions regarding potential strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of
momelotinib to update them on the results of the study.
On February 17, 2022, Nina Mojas, Senior Vice President of Oncology at GSK, emailed Stephen Dilly, Chief Executive Officer and President at Sierra
Oncology, regarding a potential strategic partnership between GSK and Sierra Oncology.
On February 18, 2022, Sierra Oncology and GSK executed a confidentiality agreement to facilitate discussions and information sharing between the
parties. This agreement did not include a “standstill” or other restriction on GSK’s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire Sierra Oncology.
On February 22, 2022, Dr. Dilly and Ms. Mojas met to discuss Sierra Oncology, momelotinib and opportunities for a potential strategic partnership
between GSK and Sierra Oncology. As part of this discussion, Ms. Mojas inquired as to whether Sierra Oncology was for sale. Dr. Dilly responded that
Sierra Oncology was not seeking a sale transaction at such time. Following the discussion, Ms. Mojas introduced Dr. Dilly to Ian
35
Table of Contents
Greenberg, Vice President & Head of Business Development, Global Pharmaceuticals Commercial Portfolio at GSK, via email, and Dr. Dilly introduced Ms.
Mojas and Mr. Greenberg to Kevin Norrett, Chief Business Officer at Sierra Oncology, via email, to continue discussions regarding a potential strategic
partnership.
On February 23, 2022, Mr. Norrett and Mr. Greenberg met to discuss opportunities for a potential strategic partnership between Sierra Oncology
and GSK with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib by GSK in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States. In furtherance of continued
discussions regarding a potential strategic partnership, Mr. Norrett and Mr. Greenberg outlined a plan for GSK to conduct a due diligence review of Sierra
Oncology and momelotinib.
On March 1, 2022, Sierra Oncology granted representatives of GSK access to an electronic data room containing due diligence information
regarding Sierra Oncology and momelotinib relevant to potential strategic partnership discussions.
On March 7, 2022, following an introduction by Ms. Mojas, Dr. Dilly met with Luke Miels, Chief Commercial Officer at GSK. During the discussion,
Mr. Miels expressed interest in an acquisition of Sierra Oncology by GSK.
On March 8, 2022, Mr. Miels delivered to Dr. Dilly a non-binding proposal for GSK to acquire Sierra Oncology for $46.00 in cash per share of Sierra
Oncology common stock, which we refer to as the “initial GSK proposal.” Dr. Dilly informed Mr. Miels of his personal view that he did not think the
proposed acquisition price would be interesting to the Sierra Oncology Board, and Mr. Miels responded that he expected GSK would submit an increased
proposal.
On March 10, 2022, the Strategic Transactions Committee met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. Dr. Dilly updated the Strategic Transactions Committee on discussions with GSK and the receipt of the initial GSK proposal.
Representatives of Lazard reviewed preliminary market and valuation perspectives with respect to Sierra Oncology. The Strategic Transactions Committee
discussed next steps if Sierra Oncology were to receive an increased acquisition proposal from GSK, and the potential valuation at which an acquisition
proposal would merit further exploration, including by commencing a process to solicit interest regarding a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology from
additional counterparties. Representatives of Lazard discussed various alternatives and considerations with respect to a potential outreach process,
including additional potential acquirors that Sierra Oncology might consider engaging with based on those parties’ previous interest in a potential
strategic partnership with Sierra Oncology, track record of transactions, ability to finance and consummate an acquisition, and likely interest and strategic
rationale for a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology, including the potential for synergies. Also discussed were the potential risks of an outreach
process, including potential public disclosure leaks, management and employee distraction, and adverse impacts on Sierra Oncology business, and the
increase in the likelihood of those risks in a wider private or public process relative to a more targeted outreach. The Strategic Transactions Committee
directed management and Lazard to continue discussions and provide additional diligence information to GSK in connection with a potential acquisition,
while also commencing a targeted outreach process to solicit interest from 10 additional potential acquirors designated by the Strategic Transactions
Committee as expected to have the most likely interest and ability to consummate an acquisition, if GSK submitted a revised acquisition proposal for
$50.00 or more per share of Sierra Oncology common stock. The Strategic Transactions Committee also directed Sierra Oncology management to continue
to engage with other counterparties regarding potential strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib.
On March 11, 2022, Mr. Miels delivered to Dr. Dilly a revised non-binding acquisition proposal for $51.00 in cash per share of Sierra Oncology
common stock, which we refer to as the “revised GSK proposal.” Messrs. Dilly and Norrett updated the members of the Sierra Oncology Board on the
receipt of the revised GSK proposal.
Between March 11, 2022 and March 15, 2022, in accordance with the directives of the Strategic Transactions Committee, representatives of Lazard
and members of Sierra Oncology management commenced
36
Table of Contents
their outreach to the 10 potential additional acquirors designated by the Strategic Transactions Committee, several of which were engaged in discussions
regarding a potential strategic partnership with Sierra Oncology and were already reviewing the MOMENTUM study data in connection with such
discussions. Four of these ten counterparties declined to proceed with discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology and did not enter
into a confidentiality agreement. Representatives of Lazard and members of Sierra Oncology management engaged in discussions regarding a potential
acquisition of Sierra Oncology with the remaining six counterparties, which we refer to as “Party A,” “Party B,” “Party C,” “Party D,” “Party E” and
“Party F,” as described below. Party A, Party B and Party C had previously entered into confidentiality agreements with Sierra Oncology in connection
with discussions regarding potential licensing, partnership and other strategic transactions, each of which did not include a “standstill” or other
restriction on the counterparty’s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire Sierra Oncology.
Also on March 11, 2022, Dr. Dilly called a representative of Party B to discuss a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology. Party B had been engaged
in ongoing discussions and due diligence review with Sierra Oncology with respect to a potential licensing or partnership transaction. The representative
of Party B indicated to Dr. Dilly that Party B would submit a proposal for an acquisition of Sierra Oncology.
On March 14, 2022, Party B delivered to Dr. Dilly and Mr. Norrett a non-binding proposal for Party B to acquire Sierra Oncology for $40.00 in cash
per share of Sierra Oncology common stock, which we refer to as the “Party B proposal.”
Also on March 14, 2022, Mr. Norrett called a representative of Party C to discuss a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology. The representative of
Party C indicated to Mr. Norrett that Party C’s interest with respect to an acquisition of Sierra Oncology by Party C would be contingent on receiving
additional clarity regarding anticipated regulatory approvals for momelotinib.
On March 16, 2022, the Strategic Transactions Committee met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. Members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard updated the Strategic Transactions Committee on the terms of the
revised GSK proposal, as well as the results of Sierra Oncology’s outreach process to solicit interest from additional potential acquirors to date, including
the receipt of the Party B proposal. The Strategic Transactions Committee also directed Sierra Oncology management and Lazard to continue the outreach
process and discussions, including by providing management presentations and due diligence information to potentially interested acquirors, including
to seek improved proposals from GSK and Party B. The Strategic Transactions Committee discussed considerations and risks with respect to a broader
outreach process and likely interest from potential additional acquirors, and determined not to reach out to additional counterparties at such time. The
Strategic Transactions Committee also determined to update the Sierra Oncology Board on the discussions with GSK and the results of Sierra Oncology’s
outreach process to date and, as part of the Sierra Oncology Board’s consideration of these matters, requested that Lazard present to the Sierra Oncology
Board a preliminary valuation analysis of Sierra Oncology.
Also on March 16, 2022, representatives of Lazard called representatives of Party B’s financial advisor to indicate to them that the value of Party
B’s proposal was well below the value of another acquisition proposal received by Sierra Oncology and that Party B would need to provide substantially
higher value in its proposal, but that Sierra Oncology would provide additional due diligence information to Party B in order to support an increased
proposal.
On March 18, 2022, Sierra Oncology management met with representatives of Party A to provide a management presentation on Sierra Oncology’s
business and product candidates.
Between March 18, 2022 and March 20, 2022, members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard held multiple calls and
conferences with representatives of GSK and its financial

advisor, PJT Partners LP (“PJT”), to discuss the scope of GSK’s due diligence review of Sierra Oncology at that time.
On March 21, 2022, Sierra Oncology granted representatives of GSK, Party A and Party B and certain of their respective advisors access to an
electronic data room containing due diligence information regarding Sierra Oncology and its product candidates relevant to potential acquisition
discussions. Over the next 10 days, members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard held discussion and meetings with
representatives of GSK and other potentially interested acquirors regarding Sierra Oncology’s product candidates and pipeline, regulatory approvals and
other relevant due diligence information.
On March 22, 2022, a representative of Party B called Dr. Dilly. Dr. Dilly re-iterated to the representative that the Party B proposal was not in a range
that the Sierra Oncology Board believed would merit further exploration. The representative of Party B declined to submit an improved proposal and
indicated that Party B would discontinue due diligence and discussions with respect to an acquisition of Sierra Oncology at that time, but would be
interested in re-engaging if Sierra Oncology’s process did not result in a more attractive proposal.
Also on March 22, 2022, Sierra Oncology entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party D, which included a “standstill” provision restricting
Party D from making public proposals with respect to the acquisition of Sierra Oncology without Sierra Oncology’s prior consent (but not restricting
confidential proposals to the Sierra Oncology Board or Sierra Oncology’s chief executive officer), which restrictions terminated in accordance with their
terms upon Sierra Oncology’s execution of the merger agreement.

attendance. Members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the discussions with GSK
and the terms of the revised GSK proposal, as well as the results of Sierra Oncology’s outreach process to solicit interest from additional potential
and the terms of the revised GSK proposal, as well as the results of Sierra Oncology’s outreach process to solicit interest from additional potential
acquirors to date. The Sierra Oncology Board reviewed with Sierra Oncology management various unaudited forward-looking financial information with
respect to Sierra Oncology’s future financial performance and the underlying assumptions, including the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
Representatives of Lazard presented their preliminary valuation analysis of Sierra Oncology relative to the revised GSK proposal. Following discussion,
the Sierra Oncology Board directed members of Sierra Oncology management and Lazard to seek an increased proposal from GSK and also continue to
provide management presentations and due diligence information to potentially interested acquirors that had already been contacted at that time. The
Sierra Oncology Board discussed considerations and risks with respect to a broader outreach process and likely interest from potential additional
acquirors, and determined not to reach out to additional counterparties at that time. It was the consensus of the Sierra Oncology Board that outreach to
additional
38
Table of Contents
potential acquirors at such time was not likely to lead to an attractive acquisition proposal and would increase the risk of public disclosure leaks,
management and employee distraction and adverse impacts on Sierra Oncology’s business. The Strategic Transactions Committee also directed Sierra
Oncology management to continue to engage with other counterparties regarding potential strategic partnerships with respect to the commercialization of
momelotinib.
On March 26, 2022, Dr. Dilly and Mr. Miels met to continue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sierra Oncology and GSK’s continued
diligence. Dr. Dilly indicated to Mr. Miels that an increased acquisition proposal would be required from GSK for Sierra Oncology to provide more in-
depth due diligence information. Mr. Miels requested further diligence information regarding Sierra Oncology’s momelotinib product pipeline and
opportunities in order to support an increased proposal.
On March 28, 2022, representatives of Party D notified Dr. Dilly and Mr. Norrett that Party D was not interested in proceeding with further
discussions regarding an acquisition of Sierra Oncology.

acquisition of Sierra Oncology.
On March 31, 2022, Sierra Oncology management met with representatives of Party E to provide a management presentation on Sierra Oncology’s
business and product candidates.
Also on March 31, 2022, representatives of Lazard called representatives of PJT to discuss next steps with respect to GSK’s due diligence review
and discussions regarding an acquisition of Sierra Oncology. Representatives of PJT indicated that GSK’s remaining due diligence review would be
confirmatory in nature. Representatives of Lazard indicated that Sierra Oncology was expecting an increased proposal from GSK and representatives of
PJT indicated that Mr. Miels would be calling Dr. Dilly.
On April 1, 2022, Mr. Miels called Dr. Dilly to discuss next steps with respect to GSK’s confirmatory due diligence review and discussions regarding
an acquisition of Sierra Oncology. Mr. Miels and Dr. Dilly also discussed Sierra Oncology’s willingness to enter into an exclusivity arrangement with GSK.
Dr. Dilly indicated that Sierra Oncology’s willingness to enter into exclusive negotiations with GSK would depend in part on the revised proposal from
GSK. Mr. Miels indicated that GSK would be submitting a revised proposal the next day.
Also on April 1, 2022, representatives of Party E notified representatives of Lazard that Party E was not interested in proceeding with further
discussions regarding an acquisition of Sierra Oncology
Also on April 1, 2022, Dr. Dilly met with a representative of a biopharmaceutical company, that we refer to as “Party G,” in connection with ongoing
discussions between Sierra Oncology and Party G regarding opportunities for licensing, partnership and other strategic transactions. As part of the
discussion, Dr. Dilly and the representative discussed on a preliminary basis the possibility of a business combination between Sierra Oncology and
Party G, but deferred further discussion to a future date.

On April 2, 2022, Mr. Miels delivered to Dr. Dilly a revised non-binding acquisition proposal for $55.00 in cash per share of Sierra Oncology
common stock, which we refer to as the “last GSK proposal.” As part of the last GSK proposal, GSK requested that Sierra Oncology enter into an
agreement to negotiate exclusively with GSK for two weeks. Dr. Dilly updated the members of the Sierra Oncology Board on the receipt of the last GSK
proposal.
On April 3, 2022, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. Members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the discussions with GSK
and the terms of the last GSK proposal, including Sierra Oncology management’s view that GSK’s remaining due diligence review would be confirmatory
in nature and that the last GSK proposal represented the highest value proposal GSK could offer at this time based on, among other things, the value of
the synergies that GSK and Sierra Oncology management believed could be obtained in an acquisition. Members of Sierra Oncology management and
representatives of Lazard also updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the results of Sierra Oncology’s outreach process to solicit interest from additional
potential acquirors to date, including that a management presentation was scheduled with representatives of Party F and that discussions with potential
counterparties to a strategic partnership transaction with respect to the commercialization of momelotinib were ongoing. It was the consensus of the
Sierra Oncology Board that re-engagement with the other potential acquirors contacted during the process or outreach to additional potential acquirors at
such time was not likely to lead to a superior acquisition proposal than the last GSK proposal, and might jeopardize the successful execution of a
transaction with GSK based on the last GSK proposal. Following this discussion, the Sierra Oncology Board authorized Sierra Oncology to enter into
exclusive negotiations with GSK for a period of seven days and directed Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini to negotiate
the terms of an acquisition of Sierra Oncology with GSK on the basis of the last GSK proposal. Following this meeting, consistent with the directions of
the Sierra Oncology Board, representatives of Lazard called representatives of PJT to indicate that Sierra Oncology would be prepared to provide
confirmatory due diligence information and enter into exclusive negotiations with GSK for a period of seven days on the basis of the last GSK proposal.
On April 4, 2022, representatives of PJT called representatives of Lazard to accept Sierra Oncology’s proposal for a shortened exclusivity period.
On April 4, 2022, following negotiation of the terms, Sierra Oncology and GSK entered into an exclusivity agreement in which Sierra Oncology
agreed to negotiate exclusively with GSK until 11:59 p.m. (pacific time) on April 11, 2022. The exclusivity period was not subsequently extended or
renewed.
Also on April 4, 2022, Sierra Oncology contacted representatives of Party F to cancel their scheduled management presentation meeting. Sierra
Oncology also cancelled the scheduled conferences with potential counterparties to a strategic partnership transaction with respect to the
commercialization of momelotinib.
Also on April 4, 2022, Wilson Sonsini delivered an initial draft of the definitive agreement to Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, GSK’s outside
counsel (which we refer to as “Cleary Gottlieb”) in connection with the merger. Between April 4, 2022 and April 12, 2022, representatives of Sierra
Oncology and GSK and their respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the merger agreement. Key terms of the merger agreement negotiated
between the parties included (1) the structure of the acquisition, (2) the terms of the “no-shop” restrictions and the circumstances in which the Sierra
Oncology Board could change its recommendation to its stockholders or negotiate or accept an alternative acquisition transaction, including the
circumstances in which the merger agreement could be terminated; (3) the amount of the termination fee and the circumstances in which it would be
payable; (4) the definition of “Material Adverse Effect” with respect to Sierra Oncology; (5) the conditions to each party’s obligation to complete the
merger; (6) the parties’ commitments in connection with obtaining required regulatory approvals; (7) the interim operating covenants applicable to Sierra
Oncology prior to the closing of the merger and related exceptions for matters such as employee hiring and compensation and entry into material
contracts or transactions by Sierra Oncology; and (8) Sierra Oncology’s other representations,
40
Table of Contents
warranties and covenants in the merger agreement. Representatives of GSK also discussed with representatives of Sierra Oncology the possibility of
entering into retention agreements with certain members of Sierra Oncology management following the completion of the merger to facilitate GSK’s
integration and transition efforts with respect to Sierra Oncology’s business and product candidates, and potential related compensation arrangements.
The Sierra Oncology Board was kept apprised of these discussions. GSK declined to enter into any retention or compensation agreements with members
of Sierra Oncology management prior to the execution of the merger agreement.
Also beginning on April 4, 2022, representatives of GSK and its advisors, including Cleary Gottlieb, were provided access to additional legal and
operational due diligence documents and information regarding Sierra Oncology in its electronic data room to support their continued due diligence
review of Sierra Oncology. Between April 4, 2022 and April 12, 2022, members of GSK management and its advisors conducted confirmatory operational,
regulatory, legal, financial, employment and other due diligence on Sierra Oncology, including reviews of Sierra Oncology’s product candidates and
anticipated regulatory approvals, efforts in support of potential commercialization, intellectual property, commercial relationships and employment
arrangements and employee benefit plans, and from time to time had discussions with members of Sierra Oncology management and its advisors
regarding due diligence information and related matters.
On April 8, 2022, Cleary Gottlieb delivered an initial draft of the support agreement to Wilson Sonsini. GSK requested that each director and
executive officer of Sierra Oncology, and each of their affiliates holding shares of our common stock (including certain funds affiliated with OrbiMed
Advisors, LLC, Abingworth Management Limited, and Vivo Capital LLC that are affiliated with certain of Sierra Oncology’s directors) enter into
agreements to support the merger. Between April 8, 2022 and April 12, 2022, representatives of Sierra Oncology, GSK and certain of the support agreement
parties and their respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the support agreement. Key terms of the support agreement negotiated between the
parties included (1) the support required from the support agreement parties based on the structure of the acquisition; (2) the restrictions on transfer of
Sierra Oncology’s securities by the support agreement parties prior to the completion of the merger and exceptions thereto; and (3) the support agreement
parties’ other representations, warranties and covenants in the support agreements.
On April 10, 2022, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. Members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the negotiation of the merger
agreement and support agreements. Representatives of Lazard reviewed Lazard’s financial analyses with respect to the merger, and confirmed their
expectation that Lazard Frères would be in a position to deliver its opinion regarding the fairness of the merger consideration. The Sierra Oncology Board
also reviewed with members of Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard the results of Sierra Oncology’s outreach process to solicit
interest from alternative potential acquirors; it was the consensus of the Sierra Oncology Board that re-engagement with the other potential acquirors
contacted during the process or outreach to additional potential acquirors was not likely to lead to a superior acquisition proposal than the merger, could
jeopardize the successful entry into an acquisition transaction with GSK at the per share price and could cause significant disruption to Sierra Oncology.
Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board their fiduciary duties. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the key
terms of the merger agreement and support agreements. The Sierra Oncology Board noted the customary relationship disclosures provided by Lazard
regarding its relationship with GSK (which disclosures had been updated as of January 7, 2022); the Sierra Oncology Board of directors did not identify
any concerns with these disclosures. The Sierra Oncology Board directed Sierra Oncology management and Wilson Sonsini to continue the negotiation
of the merger agreement.
On April 11, 2022, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. Members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the negotiation of the merger
agreement and support agreements. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed modifications to the terms of the merger agreement and support
41
Table of Contents
agreements since the meeting of the Sierra Oncology Board held the prior day. Representatives of Lazard Frères reviewed Lazard Frères’ financial
analyses with respect to the merger. The representatives of Lazard Frères rendered the oral opinion of Lazard Frères, subsequently confirmed by delivery
of a written opinion dated April 12, 2022, to the Sierra Oncology Board that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various
matters, limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the per share price (subject to applicable withholding of taxes) to be received by the
holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (as such terms are defined in
the merger agreement), if applicable) pursuant to the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Sierra Oncology Board directed
Sierra Oncology management and Wilson Sonsini to finalize the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
On April 12, 2022, after market close, the Sierra Oncology Board met with Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. Members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini updated the Sierra Oncology Board on the negotiation of the
merger agreement and support agreements. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the final merger agreement and support agreement.
Representatives of Lazard Frères confirmed that the oral opinion of Lazard Frères, previously provided on April 11, 2022 and subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated April 12, 2022, to the Sierra Oncology Board that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the
various matters, limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the per share price (subject to applicable withholding of taxes) to be
received by the holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (as such terms
are defined in the merger agreement), if applicable) pursuant to the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, was unchanged. The
meeting of the Sierra Oncology Board was then adjourned, and the Strategic Transactions Committee met with the other members of the Sierra Oncology
Board, Sierra Oncology management and representatives of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Transactions Committee approved
the merger agreement and the merger and recommended that the Sierra Oncology Board approve the merger agreement and the merger. The Sierra
Oncology Board meeting then reconvened and the Sierra Oncology Board, upon consideration of the factors more fully described in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “—Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” unanimously (1) determined
that it is in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and Sierra Oncology stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement and
consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the
merger agreement and the support agreement by Sierra Oncology, the performance by Sierra Oncology of its covenants and other obligations in the

agreements.
Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board and Reasons for the Merger
Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board
The Sierra Oncology Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
42
Table of Contents
The Sierra Oncology Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation
that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Sierra Oncology Board consulted with Sierra Oncology management, as well as
representatives of each of Lazard and Wilson Sonsini. In recommending that Sierra Oncology stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement, the Sierra Oncology Board considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented
in order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Sierra Oncology Board
concluded that entering into the merger agreement with GSK was advisable and in the best interests of Sierra Oncology and our stockholders.
The Sierra Oncology Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and recommendation:
•
Business, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the current and historical financial
condition and results of operations, competitive positioning, assets, business and prospects of Sierra Oncology, including certain
unaudited forward-looking financial information with respect to Sierra Oncology’s future financial performance prepared by members of
Sierra Oncology management and the execution risks and uncertainties associated with the development, regulatory approvals and
commercialization of Sierra Oncology’s product candidates. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the potential opportunity to create value
through continued execution of its business plan, and certain risks and uncertainties associated with Sierra Oncology and its business,
including the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of novel therapeutic treatments; risks and uncertainties regarding the
receipt, timing and scope of regulatory approvals for momelotinib and Sierra Oncology’s other product candidates; risks related to
effectively commercializing momelotinib and Sierra Oncology’s other product candidates; risks relating to Sierra Oncology’s ability to enter
into and successfully execute on value-creating licensing, partnership and other strategic relationships with third parties with respect to
product candidates; risks related to the manufacture and supply of Sierra Oncology’s products; competition from other hematology and
oncology companies, some of which have substantially more financing resources than Sierra Oncology; factors affecting the revenues,
operating costs and profitability of biopharmaceutical companies generally and other risk factors described in Sierra Oncology’s other
filings with the SEC, as listed under the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.” In connection with these matters and the
evaluation of strategic alternatives, the Sierra Oncology Board considered the fact that Sierra Oncology had recently completed a public
offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants that raised $145.3 million. The Sierra Oncology Board also noted the fact that Sierra
Oncology has incurred net losses in every year since inception and anticipate that Sierra Oncology will continue to incur net losses for
some time, and considered the risks and uncertainties related to the potential need for additional debt, equity financing or other financing in
the future, as well as the potential impact of restrictions on Sierra Oncology’s operations, potential dilution of Sierra Oncology’s
stockholders, or the loss of rights resulting from financing transactions.
•
Results of Strategic Review Process. The merger agreement was the result of an extensive strategic review process overseen by the
Strategic Transactions Committee and the Sierra Oncology Board. The Sierra Oncology Board considered Sierra Oncology’s outreach
process, with the assistance of Lazard, to identify whether other potential parties might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Sierra
Oncology on attractive terms, and to contact those parties believed to be most likely to have interest in pursuing such an acquisition; and
considered the responses received from such contacted parties,
43
Table of Contents
including the fact that only Party B (in addition to GSK) submitted a proposal to acquire Sierra Oncology at a value of $40.00 per share of
Sierra Oncology common stock. The Sierra Oncology Board, after consulting with Sierra Oncology management and Lazard, determined that
further engagement with the other potential acquirors contacted during Sierra Oncology’s outreach process or engagement with additional
potential acquirors was not likely to lead to a superior acquisition proposal than the merger, could jeopardize the successful entry into an
acquisition transaction with GSK at the per share price and could cause significant disruption to Sierra Oncology. The Sierra Oncology
Board also noted that Sierra Oncology had historically engaged in discussions with various participants in the biopharmaceutical industry
regarding opportunities for strategic partnerships and collaborations with respect to the development and commercialization of product
candidates, and that Sierra Oncology’s business and product candidates were well-known to various counterparties that could have made a
proposal to acquire Sierra Oncology if such a transaction had been interesting or attractive to such counterparties.
•
Cash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists entirely of cash,
which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business and financial execution risks of Sierra Oncology’s long-term
operating plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of
Sierra Oncology’s business. In that regard, the Sierra Oncology Board noted that Sierra Oncology’s stock price could be negatively
impacted if we failed to meet investor expectations with respect to the development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of Sierra
Oncology’s product candidates or results of operations.
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Sierra Oncology Board that the per share merger consideration represents the best
value reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking into account the business, operations, prospects, business
strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Sierra Oncology on a historical and prospective basis. In addition, the Sierra
Oncology Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks (described above), the per share merger consideration
reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common stock. The Sierra Oncology Board also noted Sierra Oncology management’s
belief that the per share merger consideration represented the highest value proposal GSK could offer at this time based on, among other
things, the value of the synergies that GSK and Sierra Oncology management believed could be obtained in an acquisition. The Sierra
Oncology Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 39 percent to the
closing price of our common stock on April 12, 2022, which was the last full trading day before announcement of the transaction; and (2) a
premium of approximately 63 percent to the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over the 30 trading days ending
April 12, 2022.
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Sierra Oncology Board that none of the possible alternatives to the merger
(including the possibility of continuing to operate Sierra Oncology as an independent company, including the need for Sierra Oncology to
pursue strategic partnerships and collaborations and capital raising transactions, and the desirability and perceived risks of those
alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Sierra Oncology’s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and likelihood
of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us to create greater value for our stockholders,
taking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.
•
Fairness Opinion of Lazard Frères. The oral opinion of Lazard Frères rendered to the Sierra Oncology Board, subsequently confirmed in
writing, that, as of April 12, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Lazard Frères as set forth in its written opinion, the merger
consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock, subject to applicable withholding taxes, (other than the
excluded holders) in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of
44
Table of Contents
Lazard Frères & Co. LLC” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
•
Speed and Likelihood of Consummation. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the likelihood that the merger would be consummated, and
the expected timing of the consummation of the merger, based on, among other things, (1) the limited conditions to each party’s obligation
to consummate the merger, including the fact that there is no financing condition to GSK’s obligation to consummate the merger; (2) that
there are not expected to be significant antitrust or other regulatory impediments, other than review pursuant to the HSR Act, to completing
the merger, as further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Regulatory Approvals”; (3) each party’s obligations in
connection with obtaining required regulatory and other approvals and satisfying the conditions to the consummation of the merger; (4) the
fact that Sierra Oncology stockholders (including certain funds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors, LLC, Abingworth Management Limited,
and Vivo Capital LLC that are affiliated with certain of Sierra Oncology’s directors) holding approximately 28% of the outstanding Sierra
Oncology shares entered into support agreements committing to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; and (5) the
business reputation, capabilities and financial condition of GSK, and the Sierra Oncology Board’s perception that GSK is willing to devote
the resources necessary to complete the merger in an expeditious manner.
•
Negotiations with GSK and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which was the product of arms’-length
negotiations with the assistance of Sierra Oncology’s advisors. Certain provisions of the merger agreement that the Sierra Oncology Board
considered important included, among others:
•
Sierra Oncology’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties
regarding acquisition proposals.
•
The Sierra Oncology Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
•
The Sierra Oncology Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative
acquisition agreement. In that regard, the Sierra Oncology Board believed that the termination fee payable by Sierra Oncology in such
instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
•
Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders who timely and properly exercise such
appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.
The Sierra Oncology Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including the following (which are not listed
in any relative order of importance):
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash transaction means that our stockholders
will not participate in Sierra Oncology’s future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving
corporation.
•
No-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Sierra Oncology’s ability to solicit competing proposals (subject to
certain exceptions to allow the Sierra Oncology Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only upon
the payment of a termination fee).
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and if it is not
consummated, that: (1) Sierra Oncology’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort
and will have experienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of Sierra Oncology during the pendency of the merger; (2) Sierra
Oncology will have incurred significant transaction and other costs; (3) Sierra
45
Table of Contents
Oncology’s continuing business relationships with business partners and employees may be adversely affected; (4) the trading price of our
common stock could be adversely affected; (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to Sierra Oncology in the event of the
termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both; and (6) the failure of the merger to be consummated could
result in an adverse perception among Sierra Oncology’s existing and potential business partners, employees and investors about Sierra
Oncology’s prospects.
•
Impact of Interim Restrictions on Sierra Oncology’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The restrictions on the conduct of
Sierra Oncology’s business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay or prevent it from undertaking strategic initiatives
before the completion of the merger that, absent the merger agreement, Sierra Oncology might have pursued.
•
Effects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the: (1) effects on Sierra Oncology’s
employees, operating results and stock price; (2) impact on Sierra Oncology’s ability to attract and retain key management, sales and
marketing and technical personnel; and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the merger.
•
Termination Fee Payable by Sierra Oncology. The requirement that Sierra Oncology pay GSK the termination fee of $70,000,000 under
certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the Sierra Oncology Board terminates the merger
agreement to accept a superior proposal. The Sierra Oncology Board considered the potentially discouraging impact that this termination
fee could have on a third party’s interest in making a competing proposal to acquire Sierra Oncology.
•
Taxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.
•
Interests of Sierra Oncology’s Directors and Executive Officers. The interests that our directors and executive officers may have in the
merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.
This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the Sierra Oncology Board in its
consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the Sierra Oncology Board concluded that the potential benefits of entering into
the merger agreement outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In light of the variety of factors considered by the Sierra Oncology Board and the
complexity of these factors, the Sierra Oncology Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Sierra Oncology Board applied his or her own
personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative weights to the different factors. The Sierra Oncology Board adopted
and approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommended that Sierra Oncology stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the
totality of the information presented to, and considered by, the Sierra Oncology Board.",42,54

The full text of Lazard Frères’ written opinion, dated April 12, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken
46Table of Contents
by Lazard Frères in connection with its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary
of Lazard Frères’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion and Sierra Oncology’s stockholders are encouraged to
read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Lazard’s engagement and Lazard Frères’ opinion were provided for the benefit of the Sierra Oncology Board (in its capacity as such) and its
opinion was rendered to the Sierra Oncology Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger, and addressed only the fairness, as of the date of the
opinion, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than the
excluded holders). Lazard Frères’ opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote or act with respect to the merger or any matter relating thereto.
Lazard Frères’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market, and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to Lazard Frères as of the date of its opinion. Lazard Frères assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on
circumstances or events occurring after such date. The current volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets relating to, among others, the
COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, may have an effect on Sierra Oncology, and Lazard Frères did not express an opinion as to the
effects of such volatility or such disruption on Sierra Oncology. Lazard Frères did not express any opinion as to the price at which shares may trade at
any time subsequent to the announcement of the merger. Lazard Frères’ opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
other transaction or business strategy in which Sierra Oncology might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Sierra Oncology to engage in
the merger.
In connection with its opinion, Lazard Frères:
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Sierra Oncology;
•
reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to it by Sierra Oncology relating to the business of Sierra Oncology;
•
held discussions with members of Sierra Oncology’s senior management with respect to the businesses and prospects of Sierra Oncology;
•
reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business Lazard Frères believed to be generally relevant in
evaluating the businesses of Sierra Oncology;
•
reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business Lazard Frères believed to be
generally relevant in evaluating the business of Sierra Oncology;
•
reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock; and
•
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard Frères deemed appropriate.
Lazard Frères assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such
information. Lazard Frères did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Sierra
Oncology or concerning the solvency or fair value of Sierra Oncology, and Lazard Frères was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. With
respect to the financial forecasts utilized in its analyses (referred to herein as Unaudited Prospective Financial Information), Lazard Frères assumed, with
the consent of Sierra Oncology, that such forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best available estimates and judgments as to the
future financial performance of Sierra Oncology. Lazard Frères relied, with the consent of Sierra Oncology, on the
47
Table of Contents
assessments of Sierra Oncology as to the validity of, and risks associated with, the product candidates of Sierra Oncology (including, without limitation,
the timing and probability of successful development, testing and marketing of such product candidates and approval thereof by appropriate
governmental authorities). Lazard Frères assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on which they
were based.
In rendering its opinion, Lazard Frères assumed, with the consent of Sierra Oncology, that the merger will be consummated on the terms described
in the merger agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions. Lazard Frères also assumed, with the consent of Sierra
Oncology, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the merger will not have an adverse effect on
Sierra Oncology or the merger. Lazard Frères did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger, nor did
Lazard Frères’ opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard Frères understood that Sierra Oncology obtained such
advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard Frères expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the
merger consideration to the extent expressly specified therein) of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any
agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the merger. In addition, Lazard Frères expressed no view or opinion as
to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the
merger, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise.
Summary of Lazard Frères’ Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Lazard Frères in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of
its written opinion, dated April 12, 2022, to the Sierra Oncology Board. The summary of Lazard Frères’ analyses and reviews provided below is not a
complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Lazard Frères’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular
circumstances, and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Lazard Frères did not draw in isolation conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Lazard Frères made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its
analyses. Considering selected portions of its analyses and reviews in the summary set forth below, without considering its analyses and reviews as a
whole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and reviews underlying Lazard Frères’ opinion.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Lazard Frères considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Sierra Oncology. No company, business or transaction considered in Lazard
Frères’ analyses and reviews is identical to Sierra Oncology or the merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely
mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in Lazard Frères’
analyses and reviews. The estimates contained in Lazard Frères’ analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those suggested by Lazard Frères’ analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used
in, and the results derived from, Lazard Frères’ analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Table of Contents
The summary of the analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard
Frères’ analyses and reviews, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of Lazard Frères’ analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full description of its analyses and
reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying its analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Lazard
Frères’ analyses and reviews.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed
on or before the date of Lazard Frères’ opinion, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information provided to, and approved by Sierra Oncology for use by, Lazard Frères for the purposes of
its financial analyses and fairness opinion, Lazard Frères performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Sierra Oncology.
A discounted cash flow analysis is a valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of a company by calculating the present value of the
company’s estimated future cash flows. A company’s “estimated future cash flows” are its projected unlevered free cash flows, and “present value”
refers to the value today or as of an assumed date of the future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting the estimated future cash flows or
amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, capital structure,
income taxes, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
For purposes of this analysis, Lazard Frères calculated a range of enterprise values for Sierra Oncology by discounting to present value, utilizing
discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%, chosen by Lazard Frères based upon its analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Sierra Oncology
and using the mid-year convention, (i) the estimated probability-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows to be generated by Sierra Oncology from
March 31, 2022 through the end of terminal year of 2040; and (ii) a range of terminal values for Sierra Oncology.
The terminal values were derived by applying a negative terminal growth rate range of (50%) – (30%) to the estimated unlevered free cash flow for
the terminal year to be generated by Sierra Oncology. The negative terminal growth rates used by Lazard Frères were estimated by Lazard Frères based on
its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
Lazard Frères then added to the range of enterprise values the estimated net cash of Sierra Oncology at March 31, 2022 of approximately $271
million to derive a range of total equity values for Sierra Oncology. Lazard Frères then calculated a range of implied equity values per share by dividing
such total equity values of Sierra Oncology by the number of fully diluted shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (approximately 32.7 million), as
calculated based on information provided by Sierra Oncology with respect to dilutive securities outstanding as of April 8, 2022. The results of this
analysis implied an equity value per share range of $38.05 to $43.45, rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Selected Public Companies Analysis
Using public filings and data sources, Lazard Frères reviewed and analyzed certain financial information, valuation multiples and market trading
data related to selected comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies, the operations of which Lazard Frères believed, based on its experience
with companies in the biotechnology industry and its professional judgment, to be generally relevant in analyzing Sierra Oncology’s operations for
purposes of this analysis. Lazard Frères compared such information for the selected comparable companies to the corresponding information for Sierra
Oncology.
49
Table of Contents
The companies in the biotechnology industry selected by Lazard Frères for this analysis were as follows:
•
Blueprint Medicines Corporation
•
Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.
•
ImmunoGen, Inc.
•
ADC Therapeutics SA
•
Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
•
Macrogenics, Inc.
•
CTI Biopharma Corp.
Lazard Frères selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses similar in certain respects to
the business of Sierra Oncology. However, none of the selected companies is identical to Sierra Oncology and certain of these companies may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of Sierra Oncology. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Frères believes that
purely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the merger and that qualitative judgments concerning differences
between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Sierra Oncology and the selected companies that could affect the public
trading values of each company are also relevant.
For each of the selected companies above, Lazard Frères calculated the enterprise value of the selected company (calculated as the market
capitalization, taking into account in-the-money options and other equity awards and convertible securities, plus the book value of debt, and preferred
equity, less cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments, plus book value of minority interests) as of April 11, 2022, as a
multiple of the probability-adjusted revenue estimates for 2026 from FactSet Research Systems, Wall Street research and public filings, referred to in this
section as “EV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue.” The results of this analysis are as follows:
Enterprise

Probability-
Adjusted
FY+5
Revenue
75th Percentile
2.1x
Median
1.5x
Mean

Using its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Frères then applied a range of multiples of estimated EV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5
Revenues, based on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the estimated EV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue for the selected companies of 1.2x
and 2.1x, respectively, to Sierra Oncology’s estimated probability-adjusted revenues for 2026, from the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information. The
results of this analysis implied an equity value per share range of $27.05 to $37.65, rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Using public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard Frères reviewed and analyzed selected precedent transactions involving
biotechnology companies that Lazard Frères viewed as generally relevant in evaluating the merger. In performing these analyses, Lazard Frères analyzed
certain financial information and transaction multiples relating to companies in the selected transactions and compared such information to the
corresponding information for the merger.
50
Table of Contents
Specifically, Lazard Frères reviewed five merger and acquisition transactions in the biotechnology industry announced since January 1, 2018, that
Lazard Frères deemed relevant to consider in relation to Sierra Oncology and the merger. These transactions are listed below. Although none of the
selected precedent transactions or the target companies in such transactions is directly comparable to the merger or to Sierra Oncology, all of the
transactions were chosen because they involve transactions that, for the purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to the merger and/or
involve targets that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to Sierra Oncology.

Using data regarding the precedent transactions and the target companies available from public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard
Frères examined the selected transactions with respect to the upfront consideration, as a multiple of the target company’s five-year forward probability-
adjusted revenues (which are referred to in this section as “TV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue”), as reflected in publicly available consensus
estimates at the time of the transaction announcement. The results of this analysis are as follows:

Using its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Frères then applied a range of TV/Probability-Adjusted FY+5 Revenue multiples for the
selected precedent transactions based on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of TV/FY+5 Revenue multiples, which ranged from 1.2x to 2.7x, to Sierra
Oncology’s estimated revenues for 2026, from the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The results of this analysis implied an equity value per
share range of $27.05 to $44.75, rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Other Analyses
The analyses and data described below were presented to the Sierra Oncology Board for informational purposes only and did not provide the basis
for, and were not otherwise material to, the rendering of Lazard Frères’ opinion.
Premia Paid Analysis
Using information from public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard Frères analyzed the premia paid for acquisitions of publicly-
traded companies in the biotechnology industry by strategic buyers with transaction equity values implied for the target company in the transaction
based on the consideration payable at the closing of the selected transaction (excluding contingent value rights) ranging between $1 billion and $4 billion
that have been announced since January 1, 2018. For each of the precedent transactions, Lazard Frères calculated the implied premia as a percentage
based on the amount by which the per share consideration in each transaction exceeded the target company’s (i) closing share price on the last trading
day upon which shares of Sierra Oncology traded on an unaffected basis, (ii) 30-day volume weighted average price based on trading days (“VWAP”)
and (iii) 52-week high share price based on intraday prices.
51
Table of Contents
Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard Frères then (i) applied the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the 1-day unaffected per
share price premia for the selected companies of approximately 54% and 111%, respectively, to the 1-day unaffected price per share of Sierra Oncology
common stock to calculate an implied equity value per share range of $59.05 to $80.90, rounded to the nearest $0.05, (ii) applied the 25th percentile and
75th percentile of the 30-day VWAP premia for the selected companies of approximately 59% and 123%, respectively, to the 30-day VWAP of the shares of
Sierra Oncology common stock to calculate an implied equity value per share range of $53.20 to $74.60, rounded to the nearest $0.05, and (iii) applied the
25th percentile and 75th percentile of the 52-week intraday high premia for the selected companies of approximately (12)% and 37%, respectively, to the
52-week intraday high price of the shares of Sierra Oncology common stock to calculate an implied equity value per share range of $34.95 to $54.40,
rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Research Analyst Price Targets
Lazard Frères reviewed selected equity research analyst price targets based on published, publicly available Wall Street equity research reports.
Lazard Frères observed that such price targets ranged from $39.00 per share to $51.00 per share, with a median of $45.00 per share.
52-Week High/Low Trading Prices
Lazard Frères reviewed the range of trading prices of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock for the 52 weeks ended on April 11, 2022. Lazard
Frères observed that, during such period, the intraday share price of the shares of Sierra Oncology common stock ranged from $14.90 per share to $39.70
per share, in each case rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Miscellaneous
The Company has agreed to pay Lazard an estimated transaction fee of approximately $44 million, payable upon the consummation of the merger, of
which $2.0 million became payable upon delivery of the fairness opinion.
In addition, Sierra Oncology has agreed to reimburse Lazard for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement,
including reasonable fees of counsel, and will indemnify Lazard and certain related persons against certain liabilities arising out of Lazard’s engagement.
Lazard has in the two years prior to the delivery of Lazard Frères’ opinion on April 12, 2022 provided certain financial advisory services to GSK and
certain of its affiliates, including advising GSK in connection with investor analysis, for which Lazard has received and expects to receive compensation
in an amount less than $150,000 in the aggregate. Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and
its affiliates and employees may trade securities of Sierra Oncology, GSK and certain of their affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their
customers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of Sierra Oncology, GSK and
certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard Frères’ opinion was approved by the opinion committee of Lazard Frères.
Lazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other services. Lazard was selected
to act as financial advisor to Sierra Oncology after considering Lazard’s qualifications, independence, expertise, international reputation, knowledge of
the biopharmaceutical industry and experience acting as financial advisor in connection with similar partnership and strategic transactions.
Lazard Frères prepared these analyses solely for purposes of, and the analyses were delivered to the Sierra Oncology Board in connection with, the
provision of its opinion to the Sierra Oncology Board as to the fairness,
52
Table of Contents
from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Sierra Oncology common stock (other than shares held by the excluded holders) of the merger
consideration to be paid in the merger. Lazard Frères did not recommend any specific consideration to the Sierra Oncology Board or that any given
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Lazard Frères’ opinion was one of many factors considered by the Sierra
Oncology Board, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board and the
Reasons for the Merger.”

We do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,
unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Sierra Oncology’s management regularly prepares and reviews
with the Sierra Oncology Board estimates regarding the success and timing of the development of, regulatory filings and approvals for and the
commercialization of our product candidates, as well as various partnership scenarios for the development and commercialization of our product
candidates outside of the United States. In connection with our strategic planning process and the Sierra Oncology Board’s evaluation of strategic
alternatives, as described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Background of the Merger,” Sierra Oncology’s management
prepared and reviewed with the Sierra Oncology Board various unaudited forward-looking financial information with respect to our future financial
performance for fiscal years 2022 through 2040, including the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information summarized below.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Sierra
Oncology Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also
provided to, and approved by Sierra Oncology for use by, Lazard, Sierra Oncology’s financial advisor, for the purposes of Lazard Frères’ financial
analyses and fairness opinion in connection with the merger (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of
Lazard Frères & Co. LLC”). The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information includes estimates of Sierra Oncology’s financial performance on a
probability-adjusted basis for purposes of Lazard Frères’ discounted free cash flow analysis and other financial analyses. These probability adjustments
were reviewed by Sierra Oncology’s management and approved for Lazard Frères’ use by Sierra Oncology. With Sierra Oncology’s consent, Lazard Frères
assumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments as to our future financial performance, and relied on Sierra Oncology’s assessments of as to the validity of, and risks associated with, our
product candidates.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed by Sierra Oncology’s management as estimates of our future financial
performance as an independent company, without giving effect to the merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger
agreement or the merger, the expenses that have already and will be incurred in connection with completing the merger or any changes to Sierra
Oncology’s operations or strategy that may be implemented during the pendency of or following the consummation of the merger. The Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed; it should not be viewed as accurate or
continuing in that context.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared
with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to
prospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,
reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information; (2) expressed any opinion or
any other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information; or (3) assumed any
responsibility for the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
53Table of Contents
Because the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as
well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers
multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
is not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact
and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results.
Although the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates
as to future events made and approved by Sierra Oncology’s management. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by, among
other factors, our ability to achieve our goals for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug candidates on the timeline
assumed for purposes of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions and
uncertainties that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not
to be achieved are described in various risk factors described in the sections of this proxy statement captioned “— Risk Factors” and “—Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and in our other filings with the SEC, as listed under the section titled “Where You Can Find More
Information.” All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information, whether or not the merger is consummated. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also reflects
assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may differ from publicized
analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date that it was prepared, including the announcement of
the entry into the merger agreement. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information has not been updated or revised to reflect information or results
after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not
intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information
was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events. Sierra Oncology has or may report results of operations for periods included in the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information that were or will be completed following the preparation of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to Sierra Oncology’s periodic filings with the SEC for information on Sierra Oncology’s actual historical
results.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are “non-GAAP financial measures.” These are
financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a
substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are
limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business
combination transaction, such as the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures”
under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding
disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial
measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Sierra Oncology Board or Lazard. Accordingly, no
reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives

has made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information. Sierra Oncology has made no representation to GSK, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information. The inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the
Sierra Oncology Board Sierra Oncology or any other person considered, or now considers, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to be
predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute
an admission or representation by Sierra Oncology that the information presented is material. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is
included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that was provided to the Sierra Oncology Board and Lazard.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any Sierra Oncology stockholder to make
any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares.
The following table presents a summary of unaudited prospective financial information of Sierra Oncology as an independent company for fiscal
years 2022 through 2040, as prepared and used as described above, which information is referred to as the “Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information.” Sierra Oncology management made various judgments and assumptions when preparing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,
including, among others (1) the commercial launch of momelotinib in 2023, the launch of SRA515 in 2027 and the launch of SRA737 in 2028, (2) revenue

When considering the recommendation of the Sierra Oncology Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders. Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of our directors and executive officers, together with certain
funds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors, LLC, Abingworth Management Limited, and Vivo Capital LLC that are affiliated with certain of our directors, in
each case solely in their capacities as holders of our common stock and other Sierra Oncology securities (which we refer to as the “support agreement
parties”), entered into the support agreements with GSK and Sierra Oncology. These support agreements obligate the applicable stockholders to vote
their respective shares of Sierra Oncology’s common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against the approval of any acquisition
proposal. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the
merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Sierra Oncology Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed
at the time, among other matters. These interests are more fully described below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Sierra Oncology will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and
insurance coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
Treatment of Sierra Options
As of March 31, 2022, there were outstanding Sierra options to purchase an aggregate of 5,236,309 shares of our common stock with an exercise
price below the per share price (such options “in-the-money”), of which Sierra options to purchase an aggregate of 341,146 shares of our common stock
were held by our current non-employee directors and of which Sierra options to purchase an aggregate of 1,948,691 shares of our common stock were
held by our current executive officers. Other than the Sierra options, there are no other outstanding compensatory Sierra Oncology equity or equity-
based awards.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger all Sierra options that are outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will accelerate vesting in full and will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share of such option, and (2) the
number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Sierra option. The number of shares of our common stock issuable for Sierra
options subject to performance-based vesting that have performance periods outstanding at the effective time will be deemed to be the number of shares
issuable upon satisfaction of maximum achievement of performance criteria. The cash payment amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)
will be paid to the applicable Sierra option holder following the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. All
Sierra options with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the per share price will be cancelled without any cash payment in respect thereof.

Executive Severance Agreements
Stephen G. Dilly
On June 1, 2020, we entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Stephen Dilly, our chief executive officer. Under the terms of the agreement, if
Dr. Dilly is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the employment agreement and described below) and
such termination does not occur within the 12 month period following a “change of control” (as such term is defined in the employment agreement and
described below), then, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, Dr. Dilly will be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum payment equal
to his base salary for 12 months as in effect as of the employment termination date, (ii) cash consideration in the form of monthly payments equal to his
monthly cost to maintain his health plan coverage at the same level in effect as of his employment termination date for a period of up to 12 months
following the termination date, and (iii) accelerated vesting of any unvested time-based equity awards that would otherwise vest within 12 months of the
termination date.
If Dr. Dilly is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 12 months following a change of control, then, subject to his execution
and non-revocation of a release of claims, Dr. Dilly would be entitled to (i) a lump sum payment equal to his base salary for 18 months, except his annual
“base salary” for purposes of this calculation will be deemed to equal the sum of (A) his base salary as in effect as of the employment termination date
and (B) the average of his actual annual bonuses paid for the last two fiscal years prior to the date of termination, with any pro-rated bonuses from an
initial fiscal year of employment annualized for this purpose (or, if employed for only the most recently completed fiscal year or less, the amount set forth
in the employment agreement), (ii) cash consideration in the form of monthly payments equal to his monthly cost to maintain his health plan coverage at
the same level in effect as of his employment termination date, for a period of up to 18 months following the termination date, and (iii) full vesting of all
outstanding equity or equity-based awards on the termination date; provided however that any equity or equity-based awards that vest based on the
achievement of performance criteria will vest in accordance with the change of control provisions in the award agreements applicable to such equity or
equity-based awards and, if there are no such change of control provisions in the applicable award agreements, such equity and equity-based awards will
fully vest on the termination date. Further, upon the consummation of a change in control, the time-based Sierra options and the time-based portion of the
performance-based Sierra options granted to Dr. Dilly will accelerate in full.
Other Executive Officers
We are party to employment agreements with Christina Thomson, Kevin Norrett, Barbara Klencke, William Turner and Sukhi Jagpal, which include
the following severance terms.
Pursuant to the employment agreements, if the executive is terminated without “cause” (as defined in the employment agreement and described
below) or resigns for “good reason” (as defined in the employment agreement and described below), then, subject to the executive’s execution and non-
revocation of a release of
59
Table of Contents
claims, he or she will be entitled to receive (i) a continuation of his or her base salary in effect as of the employment termination date for a period of 12
months following the termination date (the “Executive Severance Period”), subject to the required payroll deductions and withholdings and paid on our
normal payroll schedule, and (ii) cash consideration in the form of monthly payments equal to the executive’s monthly cost to maintain health plan
coverage at the same level in effect as of his or her employment termination date through the earlier of (x) 12 months following the termination date or (y)
the date that he or she becomes eligible for group health insurance coverage through a new employer.
If the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 12 months following a “change of control” (as defined in the
employment agreement and described below), then, subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, the Executive
Severance Period will be increased to the applicable length of time indicated in the table below, and he or she will be entitled to receive (i) a continuation
of his or her base salary for the increased Executive Severance Period, except that his or her annual “base salary” for purposes of this calculation will be
deemed to equal the sum of (A) his or her base salary in effect as of the employment termination date and (B) the average of his or her actual annual
bonuses paid for the last two years prior to the date of termination, with any pro-rated bonuses during an initial fiscal year of employment annualized for
this purpose (or, if employed for only the most recently completed fiscal year or less, the amount set forth in the employment agreement) and (ii) cash
consideration in the form of monthly payments equal to the executive’s monthly cost to maintain health plan coverage at the same level in effect as of his
or her employment termination date for a period of up to the expiration of the increased Executive Severance Period. The increased Executive Severance
Period is determined based on the executive’s years of service with our company, as set forth below:

Additionally, if the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 12 months following a change of control, he or she will
be entitled to full vesting of all outstanding equity and equity-based awards, except that any equity and equity-based awards that vest based on the
achievement of performance criteria shall vest in accordance with the change of control provisions in the applicable award agreement (or, if no such
provisions exist, shall vest in full).
General Severance and Change in Control Benefit Matters
All severance and severance-related acceleration benefits described above are subject to the named executive officer’s execution and non-
revocation of a release of claims in favor of us. Under the employment agreements, the named executive officers are also subject to covenants regarding
confidentiality and prohibition on solicitation of our employees or independent contractors or the business of our customers or prospective customers
for a period of one year following the termination of employment.
Under the employment agreements, in the event the severance payments and other benefits payable to an executive constitute “parachute
payments” under Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and would be subject to the applicable excise tax, then the executive’s severance
payments and benefits will be either (i) delivered in full or (ii) delivered to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such payments or
benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by executive on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of benefits.

and, for executive officers other than Mr. Dilly, the acquisition of Sierra Oncology and subsequent conversion to a division or unit of the acquiring entity
will not by itself result in a diminution; (ii) without the executive’s written consent, a reduction in base salary or, with respect to Dr. Dilly, bonus
opportunity, as in effect immediately prior to such reduction by more than 10%, unless such reduction is also applicable to all other senior executives
(with respect to Dr. Dilly, such reduction to all other senior executives must be of no more than 15% to qualify for this exception); (iii) our material
violation of any contract or agreement between the executive and us; or (iv) without the executive’s written consent, any requirement by us that the
executive relocates to a work site located more than 50 miles from his or her principal place of employment as of the date of the executive’s employment
agreement with us.
Impact of Corporate Transaction or Change in Control under Equity Plans
Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”) and our 2018 Equity Inducement Plan (“2018 Plan”), each provide that in the event of a “corporate
transaction” as defined under the applicable plan, any or all outstanding awards may be assumed or replaced by the successor corporation, including
through the substitution of equity awards or substantially similar consideration. In the event that the successor or acquiring corporation does not
assume, convert, replace or substitute awards, then such awards will fully vest immediately prior to the corporate transaction, and either the award holder
will be notified that such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction and will then terminate upon the
expiration of the specified period of time, or the award will be cancelled upon the occurrence of the corporate transaction in exchange for cash of
equivalent value.
Our 2015 Plan provides that all awards granted to non-employee directors automatically accelerate vesting in full immediately prior to the
consummation of a “corporate transaction.” The merger is a “corporate transaction” under the 2015 Plan and the 2018 Plan.
61
Table of Contents
Similarly, under our 2008 Stock Plan (“2008 Plan”), in the event of a merger or “change in control,” as defined under the 2008 Plan, each
outstanding award will be assumed or substituted by the successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary, except that if a successor corporation or its
parent or subsidiary does not assume or substitute an equivalent award for any outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, and such award will
become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified
period of time. All awards granted under our 2008 Plan are fully vested.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger
that may be paid or become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Please see the previous portions of this
section for further information regarding this compensation with respect to certain of our executive officers.
The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable to our named executive officers assuming, solely for
purposes of this table, that the merger was consummated on March 31, 2022, and in the case of each named executive officer, that the named executive
officer’s employment is terminated by Sierra Oncology without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, in each case, on that date.
Sierra’s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other perquisites or benefits in
connection with the merger. The values in this table assume no reduction under the terms of the employment agreements for any payments that may
constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the merger. In addition to the assumptions
regarding the consummation date of the merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are
described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with
the mergers may differ from the amounts set forth below.

On March 22, 2022, we entered into a transition agreement and release with Dr. Kowalski, our former Chief, Research and Early Development,
pursuant to which his employment terminated on March 10, 2022. This agreement was entered into independently of the merger and for purposes of
this table, we assume that none of the consideration received by Dr. Kowalski in connection with the transition agreement is contingent upon or
related to the merger. Under the transition agreement, Dr. Kowalski received or is in the process of receiving a total severance payment of $474,986,
representing twelve months base salary, less applicable withholdings, paid over twelve months from the termination date, plus a total of $17,290 to
assist Dr. Kowalski’s out-of-pocket healthcare costs, at a rate of $1,330 per month, less applicable withholdings, for thirteen months from the
termination date. Dr. Kowalski also entered into a consulting agreement with Sierra Oncology following the termination of his employment through
June 30, 2023, pursuant to which he will be paid $400 per hour of consulting service provided. Under the transition agreement, Dr. Kowalski agreed
to permanently forfeit the unvested portion of each time-based Sierra option as of the termination date. Dr. Kowalski’s performance-based Sierra
options remain outstanding following his termination and will accelerate vesting and be cancelled in accordance with the merger agreement.
Employment and Non-Compete Arrangements Following the Merger
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Sierra Oncology’s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on potential employment or
other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with GSK or Acquisition Sub; or (2) entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements
regarding employment or other retention with the surviving corporation or with GSK or Acquisition Sub to be effective following the consummation of
the merger. However, prior to the effective time of the merger, GSK or Acquisition Sub may have discussions regarding employment, compensation or
other retention arrangements or terms and may enter into definitive agreements, or amendments to definitive agreements currently in effect, regarding
employment, compensation, retention or other restrictive covenants with certain of Sierra Oncology’s employees to be effective as of the effective time of
the merger. Certain currently contemplated arrangements are described below. However, the parties may choose to revise the terms of, or not enter into,
these arrangements.
Stephen Dilly Non-Competition Agreement
It is currently expected that Dr. Dilly will enter into a non-competition agreement in favor of GSK which will become effective as of the closing,
provided the closing occurs on or before March 1, 2023. Under the expected terms of this agreement, Dr. Dilly would receive a payment of $100,000 in
exchange for the non-compete, which shall be paid to Dr. Dilly within five (5) business days of closing.

Christina Thomson and Barbara Klencke Employment Agreement Amendments
It is currently expected that each of Ms. Thomson and Dr. Klencke’s employment agreements will be amended to extend the non-competition period
required under such agreements to 18 months following their termination of employment. Their current employment agreements restrict competition
through a period of 12 months following termination of employment for Ms. Thomson and during employment for Dr. Klencke. If entered into, the
amendments will become effective as of the closing, provided the closing occurs on or before March 1, 2023. Under the expected term of the agreement,
Ms. Thomson and Dr. Klencke each would receive a payment of $5,000 in exchange for the extended period, which would be paid to the applicable
executive within five (5) business days of closing.

Appraisal Rights",72,72
"Sierra Oncology, Inc._20220516_DEFM14A_20099747_4463777.Pdf",Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly demand an
appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold their shares through the effective time of the merger, who otherwise comply with the procedures of
Section 262 of the DGCL and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in
connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section 262.” Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in
Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” or to a “holder of shares” are to a record holder of our common stock.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the
full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following
summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights
under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
person having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a
bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure
that appraisal rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as well as the information discussed below.
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares to Sierra Oncology prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the
procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common stock appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
64Table of Contents
the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However, after an
appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal
proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our common stock for which appraisal
rights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as measured in accordance with subsection
(g) of Section 262; or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the
“ownership thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal
award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue
thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such
voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and
include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Sierra Oncology’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are
available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any
holder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review
Annex B carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights
under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares
of our common stock, Sierra Oncology believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of
legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Sierra Oncology a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special
meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a
stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger); and
•
a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the
value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal
rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
65
Table of Contents
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, each of
our stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or not
vote his, her or its shares.
Filing Written Demand
A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Sierra Oncology, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the
special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. In addition, that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by
mail or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed
written demands for appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is
made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of
appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption
of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand
for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of
the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of
the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform
Sierra Oncology of the identity of the holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. If the shares
are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf
of the record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should
be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand
for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the
demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN “STREET NAME” BY A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH
TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL
OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH
AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN
A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
Sierra Oncology, Inc.
1820 Gateway Drive, Suite 110
San Mateo, California 94404
Attention: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for
appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by
delivering to Sierra Oncology, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the
demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall
not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger. If Sierra Oncology, as the
surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any
stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the
appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered
pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each record holder of shares of
our common stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of our common stock
who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed
by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving
corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will
file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of our
common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of
our common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262
could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied with the requirements for an
appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Sierra Oncology has
received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation
67
Table of Contents
must send this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a
statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of our
common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or
request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder
of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation,
the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given
to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given by
one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving
corporation.
After notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may
require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as
measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights
have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at
any time prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking
appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on
the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the
shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value
68
Table of Contents
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court
stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme
Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date
of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares
and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an
opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Sierra Oncology believes that the per share price is fair, no
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should
recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per share price. Neither Sierra
Oncology nor GSK anticipates offering more than the per share price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Sierra Oncology and GSK
reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for
purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is less than the per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if
neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will
cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of
a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value
of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly
withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of
the merger into the right to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such
holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds
above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with
Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to
vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the stockholders
seeking appraisal rights or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval

of the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. In
that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before
attempting to exercise those rights.",72,78

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) whose shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This
discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the “Code”), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the
Code, court decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in
effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their
particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as
financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or
pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in
securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate
investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock”
for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of our
common stock; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction
transaction;
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of
options or warrants;
•
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,
organized or resident outside the United States;
70Table of Contents
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of our
common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in the Code);
•
the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
•
any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
•
tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend
upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein
should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described below. If the IRS
contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO
ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER
FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons
as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as
a United States person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s
holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to
long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder
acquired different blocks of shares of our common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and
holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.
71
Table of Contents
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder
nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such
gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the completion of the
merger, and certain other conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a
lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the
merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S.
Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification
of such Non-U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (b) otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will
generally be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S. federal income tax return, for the taxable
year that includes the Merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger.
FATCA
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (which we refer to as
“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under
these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the
U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of
such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a
U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a
certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or
credits of such taxes.
72
Table of Contents
The U.S. Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding
tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the
U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the
disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.

General Efforts
Under the merger agreement, GSK, Acquisition Sub and Sierra Oncology agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, do, or cause to be done, all things and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable law to consummate the merger, including: (1) obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from
governmental authorities; and (2) making all registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities, in each case that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the merger.
HSR Act; Competition and Regulatory Laws
Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until GSK and Sierra Oncology file a Notification and Report Form with the Federal Trade
Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”), and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. The parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on April 28, 2022. A
transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their
respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The initial waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59
p.m., Eastern time, on May 31, 2022.
Sierra Oncology and GSK have each agreed to cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with the making of filings with the FTC, the DOJ
or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which a filing is made pursuant to other antitrust laws or other laws that provide for
review of the cross-border acquisition of any interest in or assets of a business (including for national security or defense reasons) (which we refer to,
collectively, as “regulatory laws”). Sierra Oncology and GSK have each also agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause
the other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the governmental
authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made; and (2) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action
necessary to, as soon as practicable, (a) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
antitrust laws or other regulatory laws applicable to the merger, (b) obtain any required approvals, consents, and clearances pursuant to any antitrust
laws applicable to the merger and to remove any court or regulatory orders under any regulatory laws impeding the ability to consummate the merger by
the termination date (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”), and
(c) certify compliance with any request for additional information or documentary material from any governmental authority with respect to the merger
pursuant to the HSR Act or other regulatory laws.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the
DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws (or the relevant authorities for filings made under other regulatory laws) as it deems necessary or
desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to
license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or
73Table of Contents
after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under
its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of Sierra Oncology or GSK. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary
approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory
approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how
long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial
period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances
and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result
in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.
The Support Agreements",81,82
"Sierra Oncology, Inc._20220516_DEFM14A_20099747_4463777.Pdf",The Support Agreements,"The Support Agreements
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on April 12, 2022, following Sierra Oncology Board approval thereof, the support agreement
parties, in each case solely in their capacities as holders of our common stock and other Sierra Oncology securities, entered into the support agreements
with GSK and Sierra Oncology. As of May 11, 2022, the support agreements cover approximately 27 percent of our common stock.
Under the support agreements, the support agreement parties have agreed to vote all of their shares of our common stock (1) in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger; and (2) in favor of any adjournment, recess, delay or postponement recommended by
Sierra Oncology (and not publicly opposed by GSK) with respect to any stockholder meeting with respect to the merger agreement, (3) against (a) the
adoption or approval of any acquisition proposal; and (b) against any other proposed action, agreement or transaction involving Sierra Oncology that is
intended, or would reasonably be expected, to prevent, materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including any merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Sierra Oncology (other than the
merger). The support agreement parties have also waived appraisal rights in connection with the merger, and have agreed not to raise certain legal
challenges to the merger.
Pursuant to the support agreements, the support agreement parties have agreed not to, until the termination of the support agreements and subject
to certain exceptions in the support agreements, (1) create or permit to exist any liens (other than certain permitted liens) on their shares of common stock,
(2) transfer, sell (including short sell), assign, gift, hedge, pledge, grant a participation interest in, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any
derivative agreements with respect to any of their shares of common stock, or grant any right or interest therein (or consent to do any of the foregoing),
(3) grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power of attorney, or other authorization or consent in or with respect to any of their shares of common stock
inconsistent with such stockholder’s obligations under the support agreement, (4) deposit or permit the deposit of any of their shares of common stock
into a voting trust or enter into a support agreement or arrangement with respect to any of their shares of common stock or (5) take any other action that
would in any way be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impair the stockholder’s ability to timely perform its obligations under the support
agreement.
74Table of Contents
The support agreements terminate automatically upon the earliest to occur of (1) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms, (2) the effective time of the merger, (3) the effectiveness of any amendment, modification or supplement to the merger agreement that decreases the
per share price or changes the form of the consideration to be received by the holders of common stock in the merger, or (4) as to any stockholder, by
mutual agreement with GSK, Sierra Oncology and the stockholder.

At the effective time of the merger and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, each Series A warrant that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and extinguished and represent only the right of the holder thereof to receive
an amount in cash (less any required withholding and other taxes), without interest, equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in such Series A
warrant), which is calculated under the terms of the Series A warrants to be
$45.98 per share of our common stock subject to the Series A warrants.
At the effective time of the merger and upon the terms, each pre-funded warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be deemed exercised in full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the pre-funded warrants) effective upon the effective time of the
merger, in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (less any required
withholding and other taxes), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the amount of the per share price by (2) the number of
shares of common stock deemed to be issuable upon exercise in full of the pre-funded warrant as a “cashless exercise” calculated in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions of the pre-funded warrants.
At the effective time of the merger, any outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of Sierra Oncology with a per share exercise price greater
than the per share price will be cancelled and extinguished without any cash payment in respect thereof.

Southern District of New York by a purported Sierra Oncology shareholder in connection with the proposed merger. The complaint names Sierra
Oncology and members of the Sierra Oncology Board as defendants, and alleges that Sierra Oncology’s preliminary proxy statement is materially
incomplete and misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks corrective disclosures, an injunction of the

On May 9, 2022, a lawsuit captioned Arrow v. Sierra Oncology, Inc., et al., 3:22-cv-02742, was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California by a purported Sierra Oncology shareholder in connection with the proposed merger. The complaint names Sierra
Oncology and members of the Sierra Oncology Board as defendants, and alleges that Sierra Oncology’s preliminary proxy statement is materially
incomplete and misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. It also alleges that the proposed merger is unfair because certain
directors and members of senior management will receive merger consideration for their stock options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards and
certain members of senior management will receive severance packages should their employment be terminated under certain

the proposed merger. The complaints name Sierra Oncology and members of the Sierra Oncology Board as defendants, and alleges that Sierra Oncology’s
preliminary proxy statement is materially incomplete and misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints seek
corrective disclosures, an injunction of the proposed merger, rescission or rescissory damages (if the merger is consummated), damages, and attorneys’

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires
that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by
Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
—Interests of Sierra Oncology’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the additional disclosures
referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Sierra Oncology’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Sierra Oncology to our named executive officers
in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Sierra
Oncology’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional
disclosures referenced therein. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have
previously formed part of Sierra Oncology’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to
stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements and/or on Form 8-K. These
historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Sierra Oncology Board, which is composed solely of non-
employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Sierra Oncology, Inc. approve the compensation that will or may become payable to Sierra Oncology’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests
of Sierra Oncology’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” in Sierra Oncology’s proxy statement for the
special meeting.”
Our stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a non-binding, advisory vote, the result will
not be binding on Sierra Oncology, the Sierra Oncology Board or GSK. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not,
by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named
executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments.

approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the

applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to GSK and Acquisition
Sub by Sierra Oncology in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the
merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Sierra Oncology and GSK and Acquisition Sub rather than to establish
matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the
representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement
may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in
circumstance or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of
Sierra Oncology, GSK or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing
of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not
rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub because
the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise
consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and
included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual
information regarding Sierra Oncology, GSK, Acquisition Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and
in our filings with the SEC regarding Sierra Oncology and our business.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions; or (2) at such other time agreed to by Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub. On the
closing date of the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The
merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as may be agreed to in writing by the parties and
specified in such certificate of merger.

The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
effective time of the merger: (1) Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into Sierra Oncology; (2) the separate existence of Acquisition Sub will cease;
and (3) Sierra Oncology will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GSK. From and after the

bylaws of Sierra Oncology as the surviving corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to conform to the bylaws of Acquisition Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, in each case, until thereafter amended.
From and after the effective time of the merger, the parties will take all necessary actions so that the board of directors of the surviving corporation
will consist of the directors of Acquisition Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their resignation or

Equity Awards
The merger agreement provides that Sierra Oncology’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:
Treatment of Sierra Options
At the effective time of the merger, each Sierra option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will accelerate vesting in full and will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the
excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share of such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon
exercise in full of such Sierra option. The number of shares of our common stock issuable for Sierra options subject to performance-based vesting for
performance periods outstanding at the effective time will be deemed to be the number of shares issuable following satisfaction of maximum achievement
of performance criteria. The cash payment amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable Sierra option holder
following the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Sierra options with an exercise price per share equal to or
greater than the per share price will be cancelled without any cash payment in respect thereof.
Sierra Warrants
At the effective time of the merger and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, each warrant to purchase common stock of
Sierra Oncology issued on January 31, 2020, and as amended on September 8, 2021 (the “Series A warrants”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and extinguished and represent only the right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash (less
any required withholding and other taxes), without interest, equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in such Series A warrant), which is calculated
under the terms of the Series A warrants to be $45.98 per share of our common stock subject to the Series A warrants (which we refer to as the “Series A
warrant consideration”).
At the effective time of the merger, each pre-funded warrant to purchase common stock of Sierra Oncology originally issued January 31, 2022 (the
“pre-funded warrants” and together with the Series A warrants, the “Sierra warrants”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be deemed exercised in full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the pre-funded warrants) effective upon the effective time of the
merger, in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (less any required
withholding and other taxes), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the amount of the per share price by (2) the number of
shares of common stock deemed to be issuable upon exercise in full of the pre-funded warrant as a “cashless exercise” calculated in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions of the pre-funded warrants.
At the effective time of the merger, any outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of Sierra Oncology with a per share exercise price greater
than the per share price will be cancelled and extinguished without any cash payment in respect thereof.

"Sierra Oncology, Inc._20220516_DEFM14A_20099747_4463777.Pdf","Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures","Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the closing of the merger, GSK will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to Sierra Oncology, which we refer to as the “payment agent,” to
make payments of the merger consideration to our stockholders and warrant holders. At or prior to the closing of the merger, GSK will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the payment agent cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate amount of merger consideration to our stockholders
and warrant holders in accordance with the merger agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within 3 business days) following the effective time of the merger, GSK and the surviving corporation will cause the
payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to
82Table of Contents
the effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented outstanding shares of our common
stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for
merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates,
together with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
requested by the payment agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the aggregate
number of shares of our common stock represented by such certificate and (b) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to our
stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of our common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to as “uncertificated shares”)
will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof. Each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of our common stock will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in
customary form at the effective time of the merger, and any documents as may reasonably be requested by the payment agent, be entitled to receive, and
the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of our
common stock represented by such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares; and (2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such
Sierra Oncology stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes. Such uncertificated shares so
surrendered will be cancelled.
If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the merger, such cash will be returned to
GSK upon demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger
agreement will thereafter look only to GSK for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar laws). None of the payment agent, GSK, the surviving corporation or any other party will be liable to any of our stockholders with respect to any
cash amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the
event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the payment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the
making by such holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. GSK or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as GSK or the payment agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against GSK, the surviving corporation or the payment agent with respect to such certificate.",90,91

From the date of the merger agreement until either the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms or the effective time of the
merger, Sierra Oncology has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted with any person and its
representatives relating to an acquisition proposal.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sierra Oncology has agreed that it will not, and its subsidiaries, affiliates and any director, executive
officer, outside legal counsel or affiliate of Sierra Oncology will not, and it will not authorize or permit any of its representatives to:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any acquisition
proposal or any proposals that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
•
furnish to any person (other than GSK, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective representatives) any non-public information relating to
Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person (other than GSK, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
representatives) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Sierra
Oncology or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case in connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or the making of any proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

inquiries from third persons relating to the making of an acquisition proposal; or
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an
acquisition transaction, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement (we refer to any of these as an “alternative acquisition
agreement”)
However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, Sierra Oncology and the Sierra Oncology Board may, directly or
indirectly through one or more of their representatives (including its financial advisor), subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement, (1)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; or (2) (a) furnish any non-public information relating to Sierra Oncology or any of its
subsidiaries to; or (b) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information or to any personnel, of Sierra
Oncology or any of its subsidiaries to any person or its representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to Sierra Oncology a written acquisition
proposal after date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in breach of the applicable restrictions. Sierra Oncology may do this only if the Sierra
Oncology Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such acquisition proposal
either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
During the period between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, Sierra Oncology has agreed that it will promptly
(and, in any event, within 24 hours from the receipt thereof) notify GSK in writing if any acquisition proposal, or inquiry or request that would reasonable
be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal is received by, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company or any of its directors, executive officers, outside legal counsel, financial advisor or Affiliate of the Company, or to the knowledge of Sierra
Oncology, any of its other representatives with respect to an acquisition proposal or any such inquiry or request. Such notice must include (1) the
identity of the person or group making such acquisition proposal, inquiry, or request; and (2) a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof and,
in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, Sierra Oncology must keep GSK reasonable informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of, any other
material developments regarding any acquisition proposal, inquiry or request (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions
or negotiations, including by providing copies of all written materials received by Sierra Oncology or any of its representatives from the person or group
making such acquisition proposal, inquiry or request or its representatives relating to such acquisition proposal, inquiry or request.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement:
•
“acquisition transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger) for:
(1)
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group (other than GSK or Acquisition Sub or any of their
affiliates, or any group that includes GSK or Acquisition Sub or any of their affiliates), of securities representing more than 15 percent
of the total outstanding voting power of the capital stock of Sierra Oncology after giving effect to the consummation of such
purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or group that, if consummated in
accordance with its terms, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more than 15 percent of the total outstanding
voting power of the capital stock of Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries after giving effect to the consummation of such tender
offer or exchange offer;
(2)
any direct or indirect license, purchase or other acquisition by any person or group (other than GSK or Acquisition Sub or any of
their affiliates, or any group that includes GSK or Acquisition

Sub or any of their affiliates) of assets (including equity securities of the Sierra Oncology’s Subsidiaries) constituting or accounting
for more than 15 percent of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of Sierra Oncology and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(in each case, other than non-exclusive licenses of Sierra Oncology’s intellectual property by Sierra Oncology or its subsidiaries, in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice for ordinary course commercial purposes); or
(3)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction
involving Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group (other than GSK or Acquisition Sub or

of Sierra Oncology’s subsidiaries) constituting or accounting for more than 15 percent of the fair market value of the consolidated
assets of Sierra Oncology and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
“superior proposal” means any written acquisition proposal on terms that the Sierra Oncology Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (i) would be more favorable to our stockholders (in their capacity as such) from a
financial point of view than the merger (taking into account (A) any revisions to the merger agreement irrevocably committed to in writing by GSK prior to
the time of such determination; and (B) those factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Sierra Oncology Board, which factors may include
the (1) identity of the person making the proposal and (2) legal, financial (including the financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of such
acquisition proposal) and (ii) would be reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with the terms of such acquisition proposal. For purposes of
the reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this definition, all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” will be deemed to
be references to “50 percent.”",97,99

actions described in these five bullets as a “Sierra Oncology Board recommendation change”); or
•
cause or permit Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, the Sierra Oncology Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Sierra Oncology
Board recommendation change in response to an intervening event if and only if:
•
the Sierra Oncology Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
•
Sierra Oncology has provided prior written notice to GSK at least 4 business days in advance to the effect that the Sierra Oncology Board
has (1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Sierra Oncology Board recommendation change, which notice will describe the
intervening event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Sierra Oncology Board recommendation change, Sierra Oncology and its representatives, until 5:00 p.m. at the end of
such 4 business day period, have negotiated with GSK and its representatives in good faith (to the extent GSK requests to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents so that the Sierra Oncology
Board no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Sierra Oncology Board recommendation change in response to such
intervening event would reasonable be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, if Sierra Oncology has received a written acquisition proposal that the Sierra
Oncology Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, then the

proposal (and any prior acquisition proposal, proposal or inquire by the person or group making such acquisition proposal);

describes the basis for such Sierra Oncology Board recommendation change or termination, including the identity of the person or group

prior to effecting such Sierra Oncology Board recommendation change or termination, Sierra Oncology and its representatives, until 5:00

cease to constitute a superior proposal, it being understood that (i) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement
to such acquisition proposal, Sierra Oncology will be required to deliver a new written notice to GSK and to comply with the requirements of
the merger agreement with respect to such new written notice (with the “notice period” in respect of such new written notice being 2

From and after the effective time of the merger, and for so long as necessary in accordance with the terms thereof, the surviving corporation will
honor all of our written severance arrangements contained in employment agreements and transition agreements and any individual service provider
providers in effect as of the date of the merger agreement in the form we have provided to GSK (we refer to these arrangements as “severance
agreements”), except that the surviving corporation is permitted to amend or terminate such severance agreements and other Sierra benefit plans in
accordance with their terms.
As of the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries will continue to employ all of our employees and all of the
employees of our subsidiaries. For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger (or until an earlier termination of employment for a
particular continuing employee), the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries generally will either (1) maintain for the benefit of continuing employees
the Sierra plans or arrangements providing for compensation and employee benefits (which we refer to as “Sierra plans”) (other than the opportunity to
participate in equity-based benefits and post-employment welfare benefits (the “excluded benefits”)) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those
in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger; (2) provide other compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits) to each
continuing employee that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-
based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time; or (3) provide some
combination of Sierra plans and comparable plans such that each continuing employee receives compensation
93Table of Contents
and benefits (other than excluded benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits)
provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time. In each case, base compensation and target annual incentive compensation
opportunities will not be decreased during the one-year period following the effective time of the merger below the level applicable as of immediately prior
to the effective time for any continuing employee employed during that period.
GSK will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause continuing employees to be granted service credit for service with us and our subsidiaries
prior to the effective time of the merger and with GSK, the surviving corporation and any of their subsidiaries on or after the effective time of the merger,
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for vacation accrual but not for
purposes of equity-based compensation or post-employment welfare benefits), except if such service credit would result in duplication of benefits. GSK
will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) permit continuing employees to participate immediately in any new compensation or benefit arrangements
that replace Sierra plans (“new plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any new plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Sierra plan in
which the continuing employee participates immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (“old plans”); (2) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
conditions or similar requirements to be waived for continuing employees and their covered dependents for purposes of new plans providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits; (3) cause any eligible expenses paid by a continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Sierra plan during the portion of the plan year of the old plan ending on the date the continuing employee’s participation in the
corresponding new plan begins to be given credit with respect to any new benefit arrangement that replaces the applicable Sierra plan for purposes of
satisfying the corresponding deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements for the applicable plan year; and (4)
credit continuing employees for any unused balances in flexible spending accounts. Continuing employees will also receive credit for any accrued but
unused vacation or paid time off as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture
and will not limit future accruals.",101,102

of incorporation, bylaws or other similar organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to

expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Sierra, as applicable, as of

will be paid by the surviving corporation; and (2) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified person to repay any amount if it is
ultimately determined that such indemnified person is not entitled to indemnification, the surviving corporation will advance all reasonable fees and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) as incurred by an indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding, whether or
not the surviving corporation elects to control the defense of any such legal proceeding; and (C) no indemnified person will be liable for any settlement
of such legal proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the
surviving corporation is entirely responsible).

GSK will cause the surviving corporation to) maintain in effect the directors’ and officers’ insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the effective time of the merger on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the directors’ and officers’ insurance in effect prior to the effective of the merger, subject to certain annual premium maximums described in the merger
agreement. In lieu of the foregoing, prior to the effective time of the merger, Sierra Oncology may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Sierra Oncology and GSK. Upon valid termination of the merger agreement under
specified circumstances, Sierra Oncology will be required to pay GSK (or its designee) a termination fee of $70,000,000. Specifically, this termination fee
will be payable by Sierra Oncology to GSK if the merger agreement is terminated:
•
by GSK, if the Sierra Oncology Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger;
•
by GSK, if a willful and material breach of Sierra Oncology’s non-solicitation restrictions in the merger agreement has occurred; or
•
by Sierra Oncology, if Sierra Oncology enters into an alternative acquisition agreement.
The termination fee will also be payable in certain circumstances if:
•
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date and, at such time, the closing
conditions related to the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and the
absence of any order, injunction, legal restraint or law that prevents or materially impairs the consummation of the merger are
satisfied; (2) because of Sierra Oncology’s failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders; or (3) subject to a 30-day cure
period, because Sierra Oncology breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants in a manner that would
cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied; and
•
prior to such termination (but after the date of the merger agreement) an acquisition proposal to acquire at least 50 percent of Sierra
Oncology’s stock or assets is publicly announced or publicly disclosed by a third party (or, in the case of a termination because Sierra
Oncology has breached its covenants, disclosed to the Sierra Oncology Board) and not withdrawn and within one year of such
termination Sierra Oncology enters into a definitive agreement providing for, an acquisition transaction involving the acquisition of at
least 50 percent of its stock or assets that is subsequently consummated.

The merger agreement also provides that Sierra Oncology, on one hand, or GSK and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, may specifically enforce
the obligations under the merger agreement.
Sierra Oncology is not required to pay GSK the termination fee on more than one occasion.
GSK’s receipt of the termination fee payable by Sierra Oncology, to the extent owed, will be the sole and exclusive remedy of GSK, Acquisition Sub
and their respective representatives against Sierra Oncology and their representatives in respect of the merger agreement, the transaction documents, the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the transaction documents, the termination of the merger agreement or the failure to consummate
the merger agreement. Upon payment of the termination fee, none of Sierra Oncology nor its representatives will have any further liability or obligation to

under the laws of England and Wales (“Parent”), Orikum Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(“Acquisition Sub”), and Sierra Oncology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company are
sometimes referred to as a “Party.” All capitalized terms that are used in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in Article I.
RECITALS

into this Agreement providing for the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”) in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations in this Agreement, and the

this Agreement, the performance of its covenants and other obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement herein; (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of GlaxoSmithKline
LLC in its capacity as Acquisition Sub’s sole stockholder; and (iv) recommended GlaxoSmithKline LLC (in its capacity as sole stockholder of Acquisition

willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of the Company, and certain of their Affiliates, are entering into a
Support Agreement (the “Support Agreements”) pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company party thereto, among other things, agree to vote

AGREEMENT
The Parties therefore agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS & INTERPRETATIONS
1.1 Certain Definitions. For all purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms have the following respective meanings:
(a) “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a customary confidentiality agreement (whether in effect as of the execution of this
Agreement or executed after the execution of this Agreement) (i) containing terms no less restrictive in any material respect to the counterparty than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes necessary in order for such Party to be able to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement) and (ii) that does not prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying
with, Section 5.3, it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making of any Acquisition Proposal. If the provisions of such confidentiality agreement are less restrictive in any material respect to the counterparty
than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (other than because of the absence of a “standstill” or similar provisions or other prohibition on the
making of any Acquisition Proposal) or would prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, and otherwise
complying with, Section 5.3, then such confidentiality agreement will be deemed to be an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement if the Company amends
such confidentiality agreement so as to make the provisions of such confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive in all material respects as the
provisions of such the Confidentiality Agreement or not prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, and
otherwise complying with, Section 5.3, as applicable.

outstanding voting power of the capital stock of the Company after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any Person or Group that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such Person or
Group beneficially owning more than 15 percent of the total outstanding voting power of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
giving effect to the consummation of such tender offer or exchange offer;
(ii) any direct or indirect license, purchase or other acquisition by any Person or Group (other than Parent or Acquisition Sub or any

Subsidiaries) constituting or accounting for more than 15 percent of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (in each case, other than non-exclusive licenses of Company Intellectual Property by the Company or its Subsidiaries, in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice for ordinary course commercial purposes); or
(iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or

the direction of the management and policies of that Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
(e) “Anti-Corruption Laws” means applicable Laws related to corruption and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of

1.3 Certain Interpretations.
(a) References to this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) when a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, that reference is to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) references to
“paragraphs” or “clauses” are to separate paragraphs or clauses of the Section or subsection in which the reference occurs. References to this
Agreement (in this Agreement or any Transaction Document) mean this Agreement as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in
accordance with Section 9.3.
(b) Hereof, Including, etc. When used in this Agreement, (i) the words “hereof,” “herein” and “herewith” and words of similar import will,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (ii) the phrase “the
date hereof” means “the date of this Agreement;” and (iii) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words “without limitation.”
(c) Neither, etc. Not Exclusive. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, “neither,” “nor,” “any,” “either” and “or” are not
exclusive. The rule known as the ejusdem generis rule will not apply, and accordingly, general words introduced by the word “other” will not be given a
restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they are preceded by words indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.
(d) Extent. The phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does not simply mean “if.”
(e) Dollars. When used in this Agreement, references to “$” or “Dollars” are references to United States dollars. All amounts in this
Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or expenses incurred by any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a
currency other than Dollars, to the extent applicable, the Dollar equivalent for such costs, fees and expenses will be determined by converting such other
currency to Dollars at the foreign exchange rates published by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source reasonably determined
by the Company, in effect at the time that such amount, cost, fee or expense is incurred. If the resulting conversion yields a number that extends beyond
two decimal points, it will be rounded to the nearest penny.
(f) Meaning of Terms. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this Agreement is equally applicable to both the
singular and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender include all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement,
each of its other grammatical forms has a corresponding meaning. All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise defined in such certificate or document. References to the
“United States” or abbreviations thereof mean the United States of America and its states, territories and possessions.
(g) References to Parties. References to any Person (including any Party) include references to such Person’s successors and permitted
assigns, and, in the case of any Governmental Authority, to any Person succeeding to its functions and capacities.
(h) References to Subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement to the Subsidiaries of a Person will be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person.
(i) Writings. References to “writing” mean the representation or reproduction of words, symbols or other information in a visible form by
any method or combination of methods, whether in electronic form or otherwise, and including writings delivered by Electronic Delivery. “Written” will be
construed in the same manner.

references to any specific legislation will be deemed to refer to such legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations, statutory instruments and
applicable guidance, guidelines, bulletins or policies issued or made in connection therewith by a Governmental Authority) as of such date. References to

California.
(n) Calculation of Time Periods. Unless otherwise indicated or with respect to any period measured in hours, (i) when calculating the
period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference
date in calculating such period will be excluded; (ii) if the last day of such period is not a Business Day, then the period in question will end on the next
Business Day; (iii) if any action must be taken on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may be validly taken on or by the next day that
is a Business Day; (iv) the measure of a period of one month or year for purposes of this Agreement will be the day of the following month or year
corresponding to the starting date; and (v) if no corresponding date exists, then the end date of such period being measured will be the next actual day of
the following month or year (for example, one month following February 18 is March 18 and one month following March 31 is May 1). References to
“from” or “through” any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including such date, respectively.

by or on behalf of any Party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such Exhibit, Schedule or document.
(s) No Admission. The information contained in this Agreement and in the Company Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained in this Agreement or in the
A-15
Table of Contents
Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of
Law or breach of contract; or (ii) that such information is material or is required to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of any
information or document in the Company Disclosure Letter is not a statement or admission that it is material or required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter constitutes an admission against the Company’s interest or represents the Company’s legal
position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No reference in this Agreement to dollar amount thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or materiality.
(t) Nature of Information Disclosed. It is understood and agreed that the (i) specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material; and (ii) the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that such items are or are not material or are within or outside of
the ordinary course of business. In each case, no Party may use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Company Disclosure Letter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this
Agreement is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or whether any obligation, item or matter included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or
is not material for purposes of this Agreement or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business.
(u) No Reliance by Others on Representations. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations
among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties
in accordance with Section 9.4 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement

(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:
(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Acquisition Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation;
(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub; or
(C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
“Owned Company Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor; and
(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to $55.00, without interest thereon (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10 (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12).
(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock distribution or dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.
(i) Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Capital
Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by any Company Stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights under the DGCL and has properly and validly exercised such statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share
Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who
have failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Price, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided
in Section 2.10.
(ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal

demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of

2.8 Equity Awards.
(a) Company Options. Parent will not assume any Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option) by (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (such amount in cash, the “Company Option
Consideration”). For purposes of the previous sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of a Company
Option with performance-based vesting pursuant to a performance period that is still outstanding as of the Effective Time will be deemed to be the
number of shares issuable upon exercise following satisfaction of the maximum achievement of performance criteria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Company Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
(b) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate Company Option Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options. Parent and the Company will
cooperate to provide that all holders of Company Options will receive a payment, subject to Section 2.13, from the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Company Options that are cancelled and
converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a), as applicable, no later than the second payroll date following the Closing and the Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary prior to the Effective Time in order that the Company’s payroll provider will be in a position to timely process the payments
contemplated by this Section 2.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a), as
applicable, cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will
issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in
no event later than the second payroll date following the Closing).
(c) Necessary Further Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action reasonably necessary to effect the cancellation
of Company Options as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8, such that as of the Effective Time, no individual shall have any
entitlement in respect of Company Options or any other equity-based award except as expressly contemplated by this Section 2.8.
2.9 Effect on Company Warrants.
(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time:
(i) each Company Series A Warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished
and represent only the right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the
Company Series A Warrant), calculated in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Company Series A Warrants (the “Company
Series A Warrant Consideration”); and
(ii) each Company Pre-Funded Warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed exercised in
full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the Company Pre-Funded Warrants) effective upon the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the
Company Pre-Funded Warrants, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed to be issuable upon exercise in full of
the Company Pre-Funded Warrant as a “cashless exercise,”
A-19
Table of Contents
calculated in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of such Company Pre-Funded Warrant (the “Company Pre-Funded Warrant
Consideration” and, together with the Company Series A Warrant Consideration, the “Company Warrant Consideration”).
(b) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, subject to Section 2.13, the applicable Company Warrant Consideration to each holder of the
applicable Company Warrant in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Warrant.
2.10 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Warrants pursuant to Section 2.7
and Section 2.9, respectively, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock and holders of
Company Warrants become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section 2.9, respectively. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully
guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no
more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation,
respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the
“Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes
for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 and Section 2.9; or (C) all
or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7 and Section 2.9 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level
sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7 and Section 2.9. Any interest or other income from investment of the
Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.12) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to
A-20
Table of Contents
receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price. The Certificate
so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment
Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of any holder of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.10(c)(i). Until so surrendered,
the Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment
Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood
that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such
other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Per Share Price. The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Uncertificated Shares on the amount
payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.10(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has evidenced timely payment to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any Transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or otherwise timely established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such Transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares
will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(e) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which
any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then
any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the
A-21
Table of Contents
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or
transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.10 will
thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.
2.11 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the
exchange procedures of Section 2.10(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
2.12 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in
exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
2.13 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, or any Agent of the Parent, Company or the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any
applicable Laws related to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.
2.14 Future Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record
date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.
2.15 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Acquisition Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Acquisition Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
take all such lawful and necessary action.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY
With respect to any Section of this Article III, except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (including exhibits and other information
incorporated by reference therein) filed since the Lookback Date and publicly available prior to the date hereof (other than (i) with respect to Section 3.2,
Section 3.3, or Section 3.7 or (ii) any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements,”
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of information, factors or risks
that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature); or (b) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:
3.1 Organization; Good Standing. The Company (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL;
and (b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its
properties and assets as such properties and assets are presently being owned, leased or operated. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Bylaws, each as amended to date. The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.
3.2 Corporate Power; Enforceability. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b)
perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement; and (c) subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate the Merger.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement,
and the consummation of the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have each been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize (i) the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement;
or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors’ rights generally; and (B) is subject
to general principles of equity.
3.3 Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws.
(a) Company Board Approval. The Company Board has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the Company
Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Support Agreements by the Company, the performance by the
Company of its covenants and other obligations in this Agreement and the Support Agreements, and the consummation of the Merger and each of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreements, respectively, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; (iii)
directed the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the Company Stockholders; and (iv) recommended that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the “Company Board Recommendation”).
(b) Fairness Opinion. The Company Board received the written opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of the Company
Financial Advisor to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and
A-23
Table of Contents
based upon and subject to the various matters, limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price (subject to applicable
withholding of Taxes) to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company
Shares, if applicable) pursuant to the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such opinion is for
the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Acquisition Sub).
(c) Anti-Takeover Laws. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the
Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other
similar applicable “anti-takeover” Law will not be applicable to the Merger, the Support Agreements, and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.
3.4 Requisite Stockholder Approval. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to vote to adopt this Agreement (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”) is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company Capital
Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter or the Bylaws to consummate the Merger.
3.5 Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not (a)
violate or conflict with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or governing documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company; (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of, constitute a change of control or default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of purchase, right to receive
payment, termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or other adverse change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the
Company is entitled pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.6, violate or conflict with any
Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound; or (d) result in the creation
of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of
clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, rights, terminations, amendments, cancellations, accelerations or Liens that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
3.6 Requisite Governmental Approvals.
(a) No Consent, authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to any Governmental Authority is required on the part of the
Company in connection with the (a) execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (b) performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) consummation of the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (i)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the

access to diligence) of, any Person and its Representatives relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Unless the Company has already so requested, promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) with whom (x) the Company
or its Subsidiaries has executed a confidentiality agreement and (y) the Company or its Representatives have engaged in any discussions or negotiations
within the 12 months preceding the date of this Agreement, in each case, in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Transaction, promptly

determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within

Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.

commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such delay being considered a violation of this
Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a
“Company Board Recommendation Change”), it being understood that none of (1) the determination in itself by the Company Board that an Acquisition

(2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance to the effect that the
Company Board has (A) so determined and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which

the end of such four (4) Business Day period, have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that the Company Board no
longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:

the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;

consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), which notice will describe the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal and include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and
(4) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives,
until 5:00 p.m. on the last day of the Notice Period, have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, it being understood that (a) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to
such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.3(d)(ii)(4) with respect to such new written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice being two (2) Business Days); and (b)

status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by providing copies of all written materials received by the Company or any of its
Representatives from the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or its Representatives relating to such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request.

withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board Recommendation Change.

of the Company or by the Financial Advisor (collectively, the “Specified Representatives”) that, if taken by Company, would constitute a breach of any
provision set forth in this Section 5.3 shall be deemed to constitute a breach of such provision by the Company; and (ii) if the Company is made aware of
an action by any of its Representatives (other than the Specified Representatives) that would constitute a breach of any provision of this Section 5.3 if
taken by the Company and the Company does not use its reasonable best efforts to prohibit or terminate such action, then such action will be deemed to

(a) Filings Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Regulatory Laws. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.1, each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, will
use (and will cause its respective Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to file (i) a Notification and Report Form relating to this

Regulatory Laws. Each of Parent and the Company will (and will cause each of its respective Representatives, as applicable, to) (A) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings; (B) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply the other (or cause the other to be
supplied) any information that may be required in order to make such filings; (C) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause the other

(b) Cooperation. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub will (and will cause each of
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, (i) promptly notify the other Parties of (and, if in writing,
furnish them with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise them of the contents of)) any material communication received by such Person
from a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good
faith any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal notifications, filings, submissions or other written
communications (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in
connection with the Merger to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such
submissions and filings to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and any developments, meetings or discussions with any

of any waiting period; (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action
or proceeding under applicable Law; and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental

Governmental Authority in respect of the Merger without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting, hearing, proceeding or
discussion, and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to “outside counsel” only and any
such information will not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the non-public information. Each
of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub may redact any valuation and related information before sharing any information provided to any
Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside counsel” only basis. Without limiting Section 6.2(a), including the obligation to make the
filings contemplated by clause (i) of Section 6.2(a), Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and direct all aspects of the Parties’ efforts to obtain the
required approvals under the applicable Regulatory Laws, including making the final determination as to the appropriate strategy relating to any matters
relating to the applicable Regulatory Laws, including with respect to any filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any
Governmental Authority; provided, that Parent shall consult with the Company in a reasonable manner and consider in good faith the views and
comments of the Company in connection with the foregoing.
6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings.
(a) Preparation. Subject to Parent’s timely compliance with Section 6.3(b), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days from the date of this Agreement), the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the Company Stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting (the proxy statement,
including any amendments or supplements, the “Proxy Statement”). Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter,
Parent and its legal counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (including all amendments and
supplements thereto and including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent and its legal counsel with a copy or a description of any comments (including oral comments) received by the Company or its
legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.3 and unless a Company Board
Recommendation Change has been made in accordance with Section 5.3, the Company will (i) include the Company Board Recommendation and the
fairness opinion of the Company Financial Advisor referred to in Section 3.3(b) in the Proxy Statement; and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Promptly following the (A) confirmation by the SEC that it has no further comments or (B)
expiration of the 10-day waiting period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company will cause the Proxy Statement
in definitive form to be mailed to the Company Stockholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company: (i) shall promptly respond to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement and (B) to the extent required by the applicable requirements of United States securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement to the extent that such information shall be or
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement, as
supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and, to
A-51
Table of Contents
the extent required by the United States securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, to be disseminated to holders of
Company Common Stock.
(b) Parent Cooperation. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or the Company’s
legal counsel all information concerning the Parent or their respective Affiliates that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with the
Proxy Statement or any action contemplated by this Section 6.3(b).
(c) No Amendments to Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.3 and unless Company Board Recommendation Change made in accordance
with Section 5.3, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without the approval of Parent, which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
(d) Other Required Company Filings. If the Company determines that it is required to file any document, other than the Proxy Statement,
with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company
Filing”), then the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The
Company will cause any Other Required Company Filing to (i) comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC and Nasdaq and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is
made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in such Other Required Company Filing. Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter, the Company may
not file any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon, and the Company will give reasonable consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel.
(e) Other Required Parent Filings. If Parent or Acquisition Sub determines that it is required to file any document (other than any Form 20-
F or Form 6-K under the Exchange Act), with the SEC as a result of the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (an “Other Required Parent Filing”), then
Parent and Acquisition Sub will use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC.
Parent and Acquisition Sub will cause any Other Required Parent Filing to (i) comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in such Other Required Parent Filing. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub may file any
Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,
and Parent will give good faith consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Company or its counsel.
(f) SEC Correspondence. The Parties will notify each other as promptly as practicable of the receipt of any comments, whether written or
oral, from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent
Filing, or for additional information, and will supply each other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to such filings. The Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC
comments, if any, with respect to the Proxy Statement, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof.

6.4 Company Stockholder Meeting.
(a) Call of Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Charter and
the Bylaws to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (including any adjournment,
postponement or other delay thereof, the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of (i) seeking the Requisite Stockholder Approval; (ii) in accordance with Regulation 14A under
the Exchange Act, seeking advisory approval of a proposal in connection with a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may
become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the Merger; and (iii) a customary proposal to
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting and shall cooperate with
and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the definitive
Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and submit the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement for the approval of the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting whether or not a Company Board Recommendation
Change shall have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company, the Company
Board or the Company’s Representatives or the Company Stockholders.
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will be
permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present
or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; (ii) and solely to the extent
the Company is required to do so to comply with applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC (provided that the Company shall consult with Parent as
reasonably practicable prior to any such postponement or adjournment); or (iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that it is required by applicable Law to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give the Company
Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made
available to the Company Stockholders. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company Stockholder Meeting will not be postponed or
adjourned by more than 5 Business Days at a time without the prior written consent of Parent, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4(b)(ii). In no
event will the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent, unless required by applicable Law
(including in connection with any postponement of the meeting permitted in accordance with the prior sentence).
(c) Matters to be Considered. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
and the proposals described in Section 6.4(a)(ii) and Section 6.4(a)(iii) shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting.
6.5 Anti-Takeover Laws. Neither Parent nor the Company will take any action that would be reasonably expected to cause any “takeover” Law to
become applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, and each of Parent, the Company and the Company Board will (a) take all reasonable actions within
their power to ensure that no “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to
the Merger, use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate or minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger.
6.6 Access. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice,
A-53
Table of Contents
to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and promptly provide Parent and Parent’s Representatives with
all reasonably requested information regarding the business of the Company and such additional information regarding the Company as Parent may
reasonably request, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or
information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such
documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause
a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; or (d) such documents or information
are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the
other hand provided, however, that, in such instances, the Company shall inform Parent of the general nature of the information being withheld and, upon
Parent’s request, reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the
outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (d). Nothing in this Section 6.6 will be construed to require any advisors (including any legal
counsel, financial advisors or accountants) of the Company or its Subsidiaries to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.6 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject
to the Company’s reasonable and generally applicable security measures, health and safety measures, and will not include the right to perform any
“invasive” testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including any Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth in this Section 6.6 by electronic means if reasonably practicable if physical
access is not permitted under applicable Law as a result or COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this Section 6.6. No access or investigation hereunder shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreement of
the Company or the conditions or obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available
hereunder.
6.7 Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
6.8 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Indemnified Persons. Each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, its obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between it and any of its current or former
directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee of it prior to the Effective Time) (collectively, the “Indemnified
Persons”) set forth on Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter or that use the same form in all material respects as the form of indemnification
agreement filed with the SEC Reports. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause
its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Charter, the Bylaws or the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement.
During such six-year period or such period in which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.8(b), whichever
is longer, such provisions may not be
A-54
Table of Contents
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to any applicable Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.8(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and
hold harmless, in accordance with provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws or the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains,
directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to the
Merger (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), then the claim asserted in such
notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection with any Legal Proceeding of the
type contemplated by this Section 6.8(b), (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B) to
the extent required in the applicable organizational documents or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (1) the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by any Indemnified Person in connection with such Legal
Proceeding will be paid by the Surviving Corporation; and (2) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any
amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will advance all reasonable
fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (C) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any
settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which
the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible).
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the D&O Insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to
those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300 percent amount, the “Maximum
Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of
maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Company may (and, at Parent’s request, shall use reasonable best effort to) purchase
a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, it being understood that if the aggregate cost would exceed that limit, the Company may
A-55
Table of Contents
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable up to such limit. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, then the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8 if Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person.
(e) No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.8 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the
Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8, with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.8
will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and
officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.
6.9 Employee Matters.
(a) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time and for so long as necessary in accordance with the terms thereof, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the written severance arrangements contained in employment
agreements and transition agreements between the Company and any individual Service Provider in effect as of the date hereof, in the form provided to
Parent as of the date hereof, and disclosed on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Severance Agreements”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to Section 6.9(c), nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plans or
Severance Agreements in accordance with their terms.
(b) Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time by taking such actions, if
any, as are required by applicable Law. For one year following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, through the applicable Continuing Employee’s termination
of employment) (the “Comparability Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Company Benefit Plans and any other employee benefit plans or other
compensation arrangements (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and post-employment welfare benefits) of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) on
A-56
Table of Contents
terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (ii) provide compensation and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, and post-employment welfare benefits)
to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in
equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
(“Comparable Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives
compensation and benefits (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and post-employment welfare benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and post-employment
welfare benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target incentive
compensation opportunity will not be decreased during the Comparability Period below the level applicable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. For purposes of this Section 6.9(b), the portion of compensation and benefits attributable to
termination entitlements to a Continuing Employee applicable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be as reflected on Section 6.9(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter or in a Severance Agreement, as applicable.
(c) New Plans. At or after the Effective Time, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to, or cause the Surviving Corporation or any
other Subsidiary of Parent to, cause to be granted to the Continuing Employees credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual but excluding equity-based
benefits, and post-employment welfare benefits) (it being understood that it shall not be deemed to be commercially unreasonable for Parent to, or to
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide credit for all such services for purposes of the severance as contemplated in Section 6.9(b) of this Agreement
and the Company Disclosure Letter), except in each case that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to (i) cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to
the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations,
physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, (iii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance,
offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New
Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but
unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective
Time, will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.

deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement
is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such termination.
(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual
written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. Following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party or it Representatives to the other
Parties, as applicable, except, and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, that Section 6.12, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each survive
the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject to Section
8.3, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for Fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this
Agreement (which liability the Parties acknowledge and agree (i) may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs; and (ii) will be
determined in the discretion of the Chosen Court). No termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.
8.3 Fees and Expenses.
(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.10(d), Parent will be responsible for, and
pay or cause to be paid, all Transfer Taxes.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to (x) Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d) and, at the time of
such termination, the conditions set forth Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied; or (y) Section 8.1(e) as a result of the Company having
failed to perform any of its covenants contained in this Agreement; (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed (or, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e),
disclosed to the Company Board) and not withdrawn; and (C) within one year of such termination, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or
the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is
subsequently consummated, then the Company will, concurrently with the consummation of such
A-64
Table of Contents
Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15 percent” in the
definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50 percent.”
(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company
must, within two (2) Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent.
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must, concurrently with
such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by Parent.
(c) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination may be payable pursuant to more than one provision
of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation;
and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee if, as and when required to
be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party
receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
(d) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Except in the event of Fraud or Willful Breach, (i) if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the sole and exclusive remedies of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Representatives against the Company and its Representatives in respect of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to
consummate the Merger and (ii) upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company nor its Representatives will have any further
liability or obligation to Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Representatives or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any matters forming the basis of
such termination.
(e) Payment Default. If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for, or the Company otherwise pays, the amount set
forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof, then the Company will pay or cause to be paid to Parent the reasonable and document out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonably and documented attorneys’ fees) of such party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on
such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published by The Wall Street Journal or other authoritative source on the
date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus three percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by Law.

(b) Additional Procedures. Rejection or other refusal to accept any notice properly delivered hereunder, or the inability to deliver because
of changed address or other details of which no notice is given, will be deemed to be receipt of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.2 as of the date of
rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. Any notice received by the addressee on any Business Day after 5:00 p.m., addressee’s local time, or on any day
that is not a Business Day will be deemed to have been received at 9:00 a.m., addressee’s local time, on the next Business Day. From time to time, any
Party may provide notice to the other Parties of a change in its address or any of the other details specified in or pursuant to this Section 9.2 through a
notice given in accordance with this Section 9.2, except that notice of any such change will not be deemed to have been received until, and will be
deemed to have been received upon, the later of the date (i) specified in such notice; or (ii) that is five (5) Business Days after such notice would
otherwise be deemed to have been received pursuant to this Section 9.2.
9.3 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
prior to by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by
the Company Board), except that if the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, then no amendment may be made to this Agreement
that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without receiving such approval.
9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable; (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party in this Agreement; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement by a Party to any
such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to this
Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.
9.5 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Acquisition Sub will have the right to assign all or any portion of their respective rights and
obligations pursuant to this
A-67
Table of Contents
Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a) in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or Acquisition Sub or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation; or (b) to any of their respective Affiliates. It is understood
and agreed that, in each case, such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by
any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement.
9.6 Confidentiality. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this
Agreement, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were the
counterparty thereto.
9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred
to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Support Agreements and the Company Disclosure Letter constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until the
earlier to occur of the (i) Effective Time and (ii) date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated.
9.8 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.8 and this Section 9.8, the Parties agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies under this Agreement, except (a) as set
forth in or contemplated by Section 6.8; and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Options, and Company Warrants to receive the consideration set forth in Article II.
9.9 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
9.10 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
(b) Specific Performance.
(i) Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
A-68
Table of Contents
provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the
Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement (including specific performance to
cause the other Parties to consummate the Merger, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII); (B) the provisions of
Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
(ii) No Objections; Cooperation. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. Each Party agrees that it
will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in seeking and agreeing to an expedited schedule in any litigation seeking an
injunction or order of specific performance to attempt to fully resolve any dispute between the Parties prior to the Termination Date.
9.11 Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.
9.12 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 9.12 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees
not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by applicable Law.
9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
A-69
Table of Contents
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
(WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY;
AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.13.
9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments to this Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be
considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail or through an electronic signature service (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature, agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever
waives any such defense.
9.15 No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be
cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and
(c) nothing set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability
or effect of any other provision of this Agreement.

(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock,
or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the
execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger

§ 262 Appraisal rights
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of

(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock,
or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the
execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger
did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251,
252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
(a) Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof;
(b) Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts

B-1Table of Contents
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of
the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided
that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly
designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder
and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or
consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein
provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each
stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or
(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20
days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares;
provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any)
expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of
the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to
appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to
all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following
the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the
B-2
Table of Contents
first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record
date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon
the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the
merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)
(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and,
in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall
be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names
and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied
by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such
petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated.
Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be
approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If
B-3
Table of Contents
immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are
available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for
appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger
was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair
value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application
by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of
stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.
(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection
(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to
the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with
the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the

Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

the Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions. We also have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that
obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Transaction will not have an adverse effect on the
Company or the Transaction. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Transaction, nor does our
opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed
necessary from qualified professionals. We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the Consideration to the extent
