This Proxy Statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
laws. Such statements include statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not
historical facts. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” “positions,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,”
“forecast,” “guidance,” “goal,” “objective,” “prospects,” “possible” or “potential,” by future conditional
verbs such as “assume,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by
similar expressions or the negative thereof. All forward-looking statements included in this Proxy Statement
are based upon information available to us as of the filing date of this Proxy Statement, and, except to the
extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking
statements for any reason. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by these statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement include the factors identified in US Ecology’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed on February 28, 2022, under the heading “Risk
Factors,” as updated from time to time by US Ecology’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other
documents of US Ecology on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or in this
Proxy Statement filed with the SEC by US Ecology, and the following factors:
the pendency of the merger may cause disruption in US Ecology’s business;
the failure to complete the merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price
of US Ecology’s common stock, as well as US Ecology’s future business and our results of operations
and financial condition;
In order to complete the merger, US Ecology and Republic Services must obtain certain governmental
approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the
merger may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced;
the effect of limitations that the Merger Agreement places on US Ecology’s ability to operate its
business, return capital to stockholders or engage in alternative transactions;
the nature, cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings, including
any such proceedings related to the merger and instituted against US Ecology and others;
the risk that the merger and related transactions may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays;
and
other economic, business, competitive, legal, regulatory, and/or tax factors.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements we make in this Proxy Statement are qualified by the
information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including, but not limited to, (i) the information
contained under this heading and (ii) the information contained under the heading “Risk Factors” and
information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent filing on
Form 10-K and subsequent periodic and interim report filings (see “Additional Information and Where to Find It”
beginning on page 94 of this Proxy Statement). No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors
that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements.

The Special Meeting (page 11)
At the Special Meeting, our stockholders will consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of US Ecology common stock
issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote thereon must
adopt the Merger Agreement in order for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to adopt the
Merger Agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex
A to this Proxy Statement, and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are summarized in the

Record Date and Quorum (page 11)
The holders of record of US Ecology common stock as of the close of business on March 28, 2022,
the record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special
Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 31,337,533 shares of US Ecology common
stock were issued and outstanding.
The presence at the Special Meeting of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of US
Ecology common stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will
constitute a quorum.
Required Vote (page 12)
For US Ecology to complete the merger, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of US Ecology
common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to
vote thereon must vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your
shares of US Ecology common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in street name by
your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, it
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Voting by US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers (page 12)
The directors and executive officers of US Ecology may have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of US Ecology stockholders generally. These interests
are described in more detail in the section entitled “Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.

nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a specific control number (as
applicable).
Certain Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration (page 29)
If the Merger Agreement is adopted by US Ecology stockholders and the other conditions to the
closing of the transactions contemplated the Merger Agreement (the “closing”) are either satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into US Ecology, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease, and US Ecology will continue as the surviving company in the merger as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Republic Services (the “merger”).
Upon the consummation of the merger, each share of US Ecology common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than Excluded Shares (as defined below),
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $48.00 in cash, without interest (the “merger
consideration”). At the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), US Ecology stockholders
will cease to have ownership interests in US Ecology or rights as stockholders of US Ecology, except
as provided in the Merger Agreement or by law.
US Ecology common stock is currently registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”) and is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol
“ECOL.” Warrants to purchase shares of US Ecology common stock are currently registered under the
Exchange Act and are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (together with Nasdaq Global Select
Market, “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “ECOLW.” As a result of the merger, US Ecology will cease
2 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Republic Services.
Following the consummation of the merger, US Ecology common stock and warrants to purchase US
Ecology common stock will be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act, in
each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by US Ecology stockholders, or if the merger is not
completed for any other reason, US Ecology stockholders will not receive any payment for their
shares of US Ecology common stock in connection with the merger. Except in certain circumstances
where US Ecology has entered into an alternative transaction to the merger, US Ecology will remain a
public company, and shares of US Ecology common stock and warrants to purchase shares of US
Ecology common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and
traded on Nasdaq.
Treatment of US Ecology Equity Awards in the Merger (page 61)
The parties have agreed that all outstanding vested and unvested stock options, performance stock
units, restricted share awards and restricted stock units of US Ecology under the Amended and
Restated US Ecology, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan will automatically vest and settle in cash based on
the value of the merger consideration, rather than being assumed by, and converted into equity
awards of, Republic Services.
For additional details on the treatment of US Ecology stock options, performance stock units,
restricted share awards and restricted stock units in the merger, please see the section entitled
“Treatment of US Ecology Equity Awards in the Merger” beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.
Recommendation of the Board (page 37)
The Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, are fair to, and in the best interests of, US Ecology and its stockholders; (ii) approved
and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, including the execution, delivery, and performance
thereof, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including
the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (iii) directed that the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote of US Ecology’s stockholders for adoption at the Special Meeting;
and (iv) resolved to recommend that US Ecology’s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
Opinions of Financial Advisors (page 42)
Barclays Capital, Inc. (“Barclays”) and Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. (“Houlihan Lokey” and, together
with Barclays, the “Co-Financial Advisors”) were retained as co-financial advisors to the Company
in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving the Company. As part of that
engagement, the Board requested that each of the Co-Financial Advisors render an opinion with
respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to US Ecology stockholders of the merger
consideration to be offered to or received by (as applicable) such stockholders in the merger. On
February 8, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the proposed merger, Barclays rendered
its opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various procedures,
assumptions and matters considered and the qualifications and limitations described in such opinion,
the merger consideration to be offered to the US Ecology stockholders (other than the holders of
Excluded Shares) in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. At the
same meeting of the Board, Houlihan Lokey rendered its opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to
the Merger Agreement was fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

Co-Financial Advisor. Barclays’ opinion is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated by
reference herein, and Houlihan Lokey’s opinion is attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement and is
incorporated by reference herein. Barclays’ opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with, and for the purpose of, its evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the merger consideration to be offered to the holders of US Ecology common stock (other than the holders of
Excluded Shares) in the merger, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related
transaction. Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with, and for the purpose of, its evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration to be received by the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related transaction. The
opinion of each Co-Financial Advisor does not address the relative merits of the merger or any related
transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be available to US Ecology or
US Ecology’s underlying business decision to effect the merger or any related transaction. The opinion of each
Co-Financial Advisor does not constitute a recommendation to any US Ecology stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any related transaction.
Financing (page 65)
Republic Services has committed to have, at closing, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate merger
consideration contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to perform the other obligations of
Republic Services and Merger Sub contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Republic Services
expects to finance the merger using existing and new sources of debt. The consummation of the
merger is not conditioned upon Republic Services’ or Merger Sub’s receipt of financing, but US
Ecology has agreed to cooperate with Republic Services in obtaining its financing for the
transactions. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Other Covenants and Agreements - 
Financing Cooperation “ beginning on page 79 of this Proxy Statement for additional details.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 65)
The exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the
merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, an US Ecology
stockholder that is a “U.S. holder”  (as defined in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1: The Merger - 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 65 of this Proxy
Statement) will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i)
the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in the merger plus the amount used to satisfy any
applicable withholding taxes and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of US
Ecology common stock exchanged therefor. With respect to an US Ecology stockholder that is a
“non-U.S. holder”  (as defined in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1: The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 65 of this Proxy Statement), the exchange
of shares of US Ecology common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger generally
will not result in tax to such non-U.S. holder under U.S. federal income tax laws unless such non-U.S.
holder has certain connections with the United States. Backup withholding may apply to the cash
payment made pursuant to the merger unless the US Ecology stockholder or other payee provides a
valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures (generally, by
providing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 or applicable successor
form).
Each US Ecology stockholder is urged to read the discussion in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1:
The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 65 of this
Proxy Statement and to consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or
non-U.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the merger.
No Shop; Takeover Proposals (page 75)
Except as permitted by the Merger Agreement, including under the Board’s “fiduciary out” exception
(as more fully described in the “Board Recommendation; Change of Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception”
section of this Proxy Statement beginning on page 76), during the pre-closing period, US

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ecology has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce
the making or submission of, or knowingly encourage or facilitate in any way any offer, inquiry or
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal (as defined
below) or (ii) continue, enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any person (and their respective representatives) regarding any Takeover Proposal
(or inquiries, offers or proposals or any other effort or attempt that could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Takeover Proposal), provided that US Ecology may communicate with third parties in order
to notify those parties of the existence of these contractual restrictions under the Merger Agreement.
US Ecology has also agreed that, after entering into the Merger Agreement, (i) it will not grant a
waiver, amendment or release (to the extent not automatically waived, amended or released upon the
announcement of, or entering into the Merger Agreement) any “standstill” provisions of any contract
to which US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries is a party relating to a Takeover Proposal, and (ii) it
will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
previously conducted with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Regulatory Clearances (page 68)
Under the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot be completed until any applicable waiting period
under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”)
has expired or been terminated. US Ecology and Republic Services made the necessary filings with
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) on February 28, 2022.
Even after the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expires or is terminated, the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before
or after the merger is completed. Likewise, at any time before or after the consummation of the merger,
a U.S. state or a foreign governmental authority with jurisdiction over the parties could take such
action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking
to enjoin the consummation of the merger, to rescind the merger or to seek divestiture of particular
assets. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. Neither US Ecology nor Republic Services can provide assurance that any action
under antitrust laws will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger.
The Merger Agreement also provides that the merger cannot be completed until the following
regulatory approvals, in addition to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, have been received:
All necessary approvals under any antitrust and foreign direct investment laws applicable to the
merger (including the requisite approval of the Turkish Competition Authority, which has been
received); and
Any necessary approval or written non-objection by the State of Washington in connection with
the transfer of (i) Radioactive Materials License WN-I019-2 issued by the Washington State
Department of Health and (ii) US Ecology’s Sublease with the Washington Department of
Ecology, in each case, in connection with US Ecology’s site activities in Hanford, Washington or
operations in Richland, Washington
The parties to the Merger Agreement must, and must cause their respective subsidiaries to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain and to cooperate in obtaining any regulatory
approvals required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the Merger
Agreement and as required to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. See the
section entitled “Efforts to Complete the Merger; Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 77 of
this Proxy Statement for additional details.
De-listing and De-registration of US Ecology Common Stock (page 69)
If the merger is completed, US Ecology common stock and warrants will be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-
registered under the Exchange Act. As such, following the completion of the merger, US Ecology will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Appraisal Rights (page 88)
Shares of US Ecology common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and
that are held by US Ecology stockholders who have neither voted for the merger nor consented to the
merger in writing and who have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand will not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the merger consideration, unless and until such holder fails to
perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under the DGCL. At the
effective time, all dissenting shares will no longer be outstanding and automatically will be cancelled
and will cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by applicable laws, each holder of
dissenting shares will cease to have any rights with respect to the dissenting shares, other than such
rights as are granted under Section 262 of the DGCL. Such stockholders will be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all dissenting shares held by stockholders who have failed to
perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under such
Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the effective time, the right to receive the merger consideration, without
interest, upon surrender, in the manner provided in the Merger Agreement, of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Termination Fee” section of this Proxy Statement) and certain other specified general provisions of
the Merger Agreement, each of which will survive the termination of the Merger Agreement.
Termination Fee (page 81)
Under the Merger Agreement, US Ecology is required to pay Republic Services a termination fee in
the amount of $46,253,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the applicable party under the
following specified circumstances:
If Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement because there has been a material willful
breach by US Ecology of the “no shop” covenant;
If Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement because the Board has changed its
recommendation in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining the US Ecology
stockholder approval at the Special Meeting or US Ecology has approved or adopted, or
recommended the approval or adoption of, any alternative acquisition agreement;
If US Ecology terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal prior to its receipt of the requisite Company stockholder vote; or
If US Ecology or Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances
and, in any such case, prior to such termination, a Takeover Proposal by a third-party shall have
been publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn and within 12 months following the date of
termination, US Ecology shall have entered into a definitive written agreement with respect to an
alternative acquisition transaction (whether or not relating to a Takeover Proposal made,
communication or publicly disclosed prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement).
In the event that US Ecology fails to pay in a timely manner the termination fee and, in order to obtain
such payment, Republic Services makes a claim against the Company that results in a judgment
against US Ecology, US Ecology will be required to pay to Republic Services the reasonable costs
and expenses of Republic Services incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, with interest at
the prime rate.
Furthermore, if the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by US Ecology or Republic Services
because either the effective time has not occurred on or before August 8, 2023, or a law or injunction
has been enacted by any governmental entity which enjoins the merger, and at the time of such
termination the only conditions to the closing which have not been satisfied are the condition
relating to required regulatory approvals (including under the HSR Act), the condition relating to

We are furnishing this Proxy Statement to US Ecology stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by
the Board for use at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy
Statement provides US Ecology stockholders with the information they need to know to be able to vote or
instruct their vote to be cast at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held virtually via the Internet on April 26, 2022 beginning at 8:00
a.m. Mountain Time or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. US Ecology has chosen to hold the
Special Meeting solely by means of remote location (via the Internet) and not in a physical location given
the current public health impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) and its desire to promote the health and safety
of US Ecology stockholders, as well as US Ecology directors, officers, employees and other constituents.
Only individuals who were US Ecology stockholders as of the close of business on the record date or their
authorized representatives and proxies may attend the Special Meeting. If you plan to attend the Special
Meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card or voting instruction form
that is accompanied by your proxy materials. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and
wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee for
further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a specific control number (as applicable). To ensure that
you will be represented, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website,
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM, we encourage you to promptly submit the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet
or by telephone. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote your shares by ballot via the Special Meeting
website, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted with respect to such shares.
Please contact your broker, bank or other nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a
specific control number (as applicable).
This Proxy Statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders of record on
or about March 29, 2022.
Purposes of the Special Meeting
The primary purpose of the Special Meeting is for our stockholders to consider and vote upon the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement. Our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of US Ecology common
stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote thereon must
adopt the Merger Agreement in order for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this Proxy
Statement, and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are summarized in the section of this Proxy
Statement entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 70 of this Proxy Statement.
Our stockholders are also being asked to approve the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related
compensation as well as the adjournment proposal, which relates to one or more adjournments of the Special
Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special
Meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Record Date and Quorum
The holders of record of US Ecology common stock as of the close of business on March 28, 2022, the
record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting. As
of the close of business on the record date, 31,337,533 shares of US Ecology common stock were issued and
outstanding.
The presence at the Special Meeting of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of US Ecology
common stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum.
Once a share is represented at the Special Meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a
11 TABLE OF CONTENTS
quorum at the Special Meeting. However, if a new record date is set for an adjourned Special Meeting, then a
new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the
calculation of the number of shares considered to be present for the purpose of determining a quorum at the
Special Meeting. Shares that a beneficial owner holds through a bank, broker or other nominee for which the
beneficial owner fails to provide voting instructions, described below under the section entitled “The Special
Meeting - Attendance; Voting; Proxies; Revocation - Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy - Shares of US Ecology
Common Stock Held in Street Name” beginning on page 13 of this Proxy Statement, will not be included in the
calculation of the number of shares considered to be present for the purpose of determining a quorum at the
Special Meeting.
Required Vote
Holders of US Ecology common stock are entitled to one vote on each proposal submitted to a vote at the
Special Meeting for each share of US Ecology common stock they own at the close of business on the record
date. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 31,337,533 shares of US Ecology common
stock issued and outstanding.
For US Ecology to complete the merger, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of US Ecology
common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote
thereon must vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your shares of US
Ecology common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other
nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Assuming that a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast “FOR” each of the
non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation and the adjournment proposal is required to
approve such proposals. Assuming that a quorum is present, an abstention from voting will have no effect
on the advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal and, if your shares are held in street name by your
broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your failure to
do so will have no effect on the advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Voting by US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of US Ecology were entitled to
vote 383,382 shares of US Ecology common stock, or approximately 1.22% of the shares of US Ecology
common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently expect that US Ecology directors and
executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-
binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation and “FOR” the adjournment proposal to be
considered at the Special Meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.
The directors and executive officers of US Ecology may have interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, the interests of US Ecology stockholders generally. These interests are described in
more detail in the section entitled “Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.
Attendance; Voting; Proxies; Revocation
Attendance
All holders of shares of US Ecology common stock as of the close of business on the record date, including
stockholders of record and beneficial owners of US Ecology common stock registered in the street name of a
broker, bank or other nominee, are invited to attend the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website.
During the Special Meeting, US Ecology stockholders will be able to vote their shares. If you are a beneficial
owner of shares held in street name and wish to vote via the Special Meeting website,
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM, you should contact your broker, bank or other
nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a specific control number (as applicable).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Voting at the Virtual Meeting
Stockholders of record and their respective proxies will be able to vote at the Special Meeting via the Special
Meeting website, www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM. If you are a beneficial owner of
shares held in street name and wish to vote at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website, you
should contact your broker, bank or other nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a
specific control number (as applicable).
Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of US Ecology common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend
that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in
person (virtually).
Shares of US Ecology Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may submit a proxy to vote your shares using one of the following
methods:
To submit a vote by proxy on the Internet, go to www.proxyvote.com to complete an electronic proxy
card.
To submit a vote by proxy by telephone, dial the toll-free number listed on your proxy card using a
touch-tone telephone and follow the recorded instructions.
To submit a vote by proxy using a mailing card, complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and
return it promptly in the envelope provided.
If you submit a signed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, but do not specify how
you want to vote your shares on a particular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in
accordance with the recommendations of the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. If you
fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record as of the close of business on the record date,
unless you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares of US Ecology
common stock will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement and will have no effect on the vote regarding the non-binding advisory
proposal on merger-related compensation or the adjournment proposal.
Shares of US Ecology Common Stock Held in Street Name
If your shares of US Ecology common stock are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you will
receive instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. You must follow
the instructions of your bank, broker or other nominee in order for your shares of US Ecology common stock
to be voted. The ability to submit voting instructions via telephone and Internet also will be offered to
stockholders owning shares through certain banks, brokers and other nominees. If your shares of US
Ecology common stock are not registered in your own name but are held through your bank, broker or other
nominee and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting, you should contact your bank,
broker or other nominee to obtain a “legal proxy” or broker’s proxy card and bring it to the Special Meeting
in order to vote.
In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of US Ecology
common stock in street name for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with
respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-
related compensation or the adjournment proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not
receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares
with respect to these proposals. Shares that are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee for
which a beneficial owner fails to provide voting instructions if any, will not be considered present at the
Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and, assuming that a
13 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
quorum is present, will have no effect on the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation
or the adjournment proposal. Thus, for shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name, only shares
of US Ecology common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be
counted as a vote “FOR” such proposal.
Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time
before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote
is taken at the Special Meeting by:
submitting a later proxy over the Internet or by telephone as instructed on the proxy card. Only your
latest Internet or telephone proxy will be counted. In order to ensure that the Company receives any
such later proxy in time for the Special Meeting, you are advised to submit any such proxy over the
Internet or by telephone after 11:59 p.m. Mountain Time, on April 25, 2022;
providing a written notice of revocation that is received before the Special Meeting by the Secretary
at US Ecology, Inc., 101 S. Capitol Blvd., Suite 1000, Boise, Idaho 83702, Attention: Secretary;
completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to US Ecology before the Special
Meeting (received by or with our last mail delivery before the Special Meeting); or
attending the Special Meeting and requesting that your proxy be revoked and/or voting in person as
instructed above.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without
taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. If you want to revoke your
proxy by mailing a new proxy card or by sending a written notice of revocation to US Ecology, you should
ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be
received by US Ecology before the Special Meeting (such new proxy cards or written notices of revocation
should be received by or with our last mail delivery before the Special Meeting to ensure that they are
counted).
If you hold your shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the
instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit
new voting instructions. You may also revoke your proxy by obtaining a legal proxy from your broker, bank
or other nominee and voting your shares in person at the Special Meeting.
Abstentions
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from
voting. Abstentions will be included as shares of US Ecology common stock present or represented at the
Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. Abstaining from voting
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and, if a quorum
is present at the Special Meeting, will have no effect on the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related
compensation or the adjournment proposal.
Adjournments or Postponements
Although it is not currently expected, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed if necessary or
appropriate, including for the purpose of soliciting a sufficient number of proxies “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement. In the event that a sufficient number of shares of US Ecology common stock is
present or represented, in person or by proxy, and voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
at the Special Meeting such that the US Ecology stockholder approval will have been obtained, US Ecology
does not anticipate that it will adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting.
Assuming that a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast “FOR” each of the
non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation and the adjournment proposal is required to
approve such proposals. The Special Meeting may also be adjourned as otherwise permitted by law, whether
or not a quorum is present. Any adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting will allow
14 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
US Ecology stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time before their use
at the Special Meeting that was adjourned or postponed.
Solicitation of Proxies
We are paying the cost for the preparation, printing and distribution of the proxy materials. We may use the
services of our directors, officers and employees, without additional compensation, to solicit proxies. We will
reimburse any holder of record for its reasonable expenses incurred in completing the mailing of stockholder
requested proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock. US Ecology has engaged Innisfree
M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. US Ecology estimates that
it will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $75,000, plus reimbursement of certain expenses. In addition, US
Ecology may reimburse its transfer agent, brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners
of shares of US Ecology common stock for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such
beneficial owners.
Householding
We are permitted to send a single set of proxy materials to stockholders who share the same last name and
address. This procedure is called “householding” and is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs.
This means that we may send a single set of our proxy materials, containing a single copy of this Proxy
Statement but separate proxy cards or voting instruction forms for each stockholder in your household. We
will promptly deliver a separate copy of our proxy materials to you if you write or call Innisfree M&A
Incorporated, our proxy solicitor, at:
Innisfree M&A Incorporated 
501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor 
New York, NY 10022

From other locations please dial: +1 (412) 232-3651 
Banks and Brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833
Such requests by street name holders should be made through their broker, bank or other nominee.
In addition, stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the Proxy Statement, may
request that in the future they receive a single copy by contacting (i) US Ecology at US Ecology, Inc., 101 S.
Capitol Blvd., Suite 1000, Boise, Idaho 83702, Attention: Secretary or by calling (208) 331-8400 (if your shares
are registered in your own name) or (ii) your broker, bank or other nominee (if your shares are registered in
their name).
Other Information
You should not return any evidence of your shares of US Ecology common stock or send documents representing US
Ecology common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send to
you a letter of transmittal, if applicable, and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of US
Ecology common stock.

VIRTUAL MEETING PHILOSOPHY
We are pleased to conduct our Special Meeting online via the Internet through a live audio webcast and
online stockholder tools. The Board believes that holding the Special Meeting in a virtual format provides
the opportunity for participation by a broader group of stockholders, while reducing the costs associated
with planning, holding and arranging logistics for in-person meeting proceedings, as well as reducing the
health risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This balance allows the meeting to be focused on matters directly
relevant to the interests of stockholders in a way that recognizes the value to stockholders of an efficient
use of Company resources. We have designed the virtual format to enhance stockholder access and
participation and protect stockholder rights. The Board intends that the virtual meeting format will provide
stockholders a level of transparency as close as possible to the traditional in-person meeting format and will
take the following steps to achieve this experience:
Providing stockholders with the ability to submit appropriate questions real-time via a virtual
platform;
Answering questions pertinent to the Special Meeting; and
Providing support to assist stockholders with any technical difficulties they may have in accessing or
hearing the Special Meeting.
OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING RIGHTS
The Board of Directors of the Company fixed March 28, 2022 as the record date (“Record Date”) for the
determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. On the Record Date there
were 31,337,533 shares of common stock issued, outstanding, and entitled to vote. The Company has no
other voting securities outstanding. Each stockholder of record is entitled to one vote per share held on all
matters which are to be voted upon at the Special Meeting.

"US Ecology, Inc._20220329_DEFM14A_19977995_4426339.Pdf",QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions
regarding the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the merger. These questions and answers may
not address all questions that may be important to you as a US Ecology stockholder. Please refer to the
section entitled “Summary” preceding this section and the more detailed information contained elsewhere
in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement, including the Merger Agreement, and the
documents referred to in this Proxy Statement, all of which you should read carefully.
Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement?
On February 8, 2022, US Ecology entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the merger of Merger
Sub with and into US Ecology, with US Ecology surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Republic Services. You are receiving this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies
by the Board “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-binding advisory
proposal on merger-related compensation and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of US
Ecology common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at
the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your
shares of US Ecology common stock is called a “form of proxy” or “proxy card.” The Board has
designated each of Jeffrey R. Feeler and Wayne Ipsen, with full power of substitution, as a proxy for the
Special Meeting.
What is the proposed transaction?
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of US Ecology by Republic Services through the merger of
Merger Sub with and into US Ecology pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Following the effective time,
US Ecology will be privately held as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Republic Services, and you will no
longer own shares of US Ecology common stock and instead will have only the right to receive $48.00 in
cash, without interest, per share of US Ecology common stock. Following the consummation of the
merger, US Ecology’s common stock and warrants will be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under
the Exchange Act; thus, US Ecology will no longer be a public company.
What will I receive in the merger?
If the merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $48.00 in cash for each share of US Ecology
common stock you own, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. After the effective time,
you will no longer have any rights as an US Ecology stockholder, other than the right to receive the
merger consideration.

What proposals will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
There are three proposals scheduled to be voted on at the Special Meeting:
to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
to approve on a non-binding advisory basis certain merger-related compensation; and
to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or time if necessary, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
What is the Board’s voting recommendation?
Upon consideration, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote your shares:
“FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
“FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation; and
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to approve the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by US Ecology and to recommend the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, please see the section entitled “Proposal No. 1: The Merger - Recommendation of the Board”
and “- Reasons for Recommendation” beginning on page 37 of this Proxy Statement. In addition, in
considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that some of our directors and executive officers may have interests that may be different from, or
in addition to, the interests of US Ecology stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests,
please see the section entitled “Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
All shares of US Ecology common stock owned by you as of the record date, which is the close of
business on March 28, 2022, may be voted by you. You may cast one vote per share of US Ecology
common stock that you held on the record date. These shares include shares that are:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
held directly in your name as the stockholder of record; and
held through a broker, bank or other nominee for you as the beneficial owner, including those shares over
which broker, bank or other nominees has provided you with a specific control number (as applicable) and
further instructions allowing you to vote those shares via the Special Meeting website.
As of the close of business on the record date, there were 31,337,533 shares of US Ecology common
stock issued and outstanding, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Each share of US Ecology
common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the record date will be entitled to
one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting.
Do holders of US Ecology warrants have the right to vote at the Special Meeting?
No. A warrant does not entitle the holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company,
including, without limitation, the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in
respect of the meetings of stockholders.
What is the difference between holding shares as a “stockholder of record” and as a “beneficial owner”?
Our stockholders may hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in
their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and
those owned beneficially.
Stockholder of Record. If your shares of US Ecology common stock are registered directly in your
name with US Ecology’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are
considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record, and this Proxy Statement was
sent directly to you by US Ecology. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote via the
Special Meeting website, www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM, grant a proxy to vote
your shares directly to certain officers of US Ecology or to appoint a representative of your choosing
to attend the Special Meeting and vote on your behalf by granting such person a “legal proxy.”
Beneficial Owner. If your shares of US Ecology common stock are held in an account at a broker,
bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and
this Proxy Statement was forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, who is considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares on your behalf at the
Special Meeting, or you may contact your broker, bank or other nominee for further instructions on
how to obtain a proxy and a specific control number (as applicable). Because you are not the
“stockholder of record,” you may not vote your shares via the Special Meeting website unless you
request and obtain a “legal proxy” or broker’s proxy card and bring it to the Special Meeting in order
to vote.
What must I do if I want to attend the Special Meeting?
Only individuals who were US Ecology stockholders as of the close of business on the record date or
their authorized representatives may attend the Special Meeting. If you plan to attend the Special
Meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card or voting instruction
form that is accompanied by your proxy materials. During the Special Meeting, US Ecology stockholders
will be able to vote their shares. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and wish to
vote at the Special Meeting, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee for further
instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a specific control number (as applicable). To ensure that you
will be represented, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website,
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM, we encourage you to promptly submit the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over
the Internet or by telephone. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot via the Special
Meeting website, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted. Please contact
your broker, bank or other nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and a specific
control number (as applicable).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If I am a stockholder of record of shares of US Ecology common stock, how do I vote?
If you are a stockholder of record, there are three ways you can submit a proxy in advance of the Special
Meeting:
To submit a proxy on the Internet, go to www.proxyvote.com to complete an electronic proxy
card.
To submit a proxy by telephone, dial the toll-free number listed on your proxy card using a touch-
tone telephone and follow the recorded instructions.
To submit a proxy using a mailing card, complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and
return it promptly in the envelope provided.
If I am a beneficial owner of shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name, how do I vote?
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name, you will
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. You must
follow the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee in order for your shares to be voted. The
ability to submit voting instructions via telephone and Internet also will be offered to stockholders
owning shares through certain brokers, banks and other nominees. If your shares are not registered in
your own name but are held through your broker, bank or other nominee and you plan to vote your
shares via the Special Meeting website, www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM, you
should contact your broker, bank or other nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and
a specific control number (as applicable). Please note that if you hold your shares through a broker,
bank or other nominee, such nominee cannot vote your shares unless you have given your nominee
specific instructions as to how to vote. In order for your vote to be counted, please make sure that you
submit your voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.
Will my shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name or another form of record ownership be
combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
No. Because any shares of US Ecology common stock you may hold in street name will be deemed to be
held by a different stockholder of record than any shares of US Ecology common stock you hold of
record, any shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name will not be combined for voting
purposes with shares of US Ecology common stock you hold of record.
Similarly, if you own shares of US Ecology common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly
with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign
and return, a separate proxy card or separately submit a proxy by telephone or Internet with respect to
those shares of US Ecology common stock because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Shares of US Ecology common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted
by an authorized officer of the entity or its duly appointed proxy. Shares of US Ecology common stock
held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing such account.
What is the quorum requirement for the Special Meeting?
A quorum is necessary to hold a valid meeting of US Ecology stockholders. The holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of common stock on the Record Date entitled to vote at the Special Meeting
present in person (virtually) or by proxy will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the
Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be
adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.
If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on
the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present
at the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the
nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether
a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, we expect to adjourn or postpone the
Special Meeting until we solicit enough proxies to obtain a quorum.
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?
Stockholder of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a signed proxy card or submit
your proxy by telephone or the Internet, but do not specify how you want to vote your shares on a
particular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with the
recommendations of the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. Thus, your shares of US
Ecology common stock will be voted:
“FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
“FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation; and
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Beneficial Owner. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, under applicable stock
exchange rules the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares may generally vote on routine
proposals but cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters unless they have discretionary
authority. None of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are considered routine
proposals. As a result, if the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares does not receive
instructions from you on how to vote your shares, no vote will be cast at the Special Meeting with
respect to such shares. Therefore, we urge you to give voting instructions to your broker. Shares that
are held by a broker, bank or other nominee for which the beneficial owner provides no voting
instructions will not be counted as present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy in
determining whether there is a quorum. The failure to provide voting instructions with respect to any
shares that you beneficially own through a broker, bank or other nominee will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and, assuming that a quorum is present,
will have no effect on the adjournment proposal. Your abstention will have the same effect as a as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and, assuming that a quorum is present, will
have no effect on the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation or the
adjournment proposal.
What is the voting requirement to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?
Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires stockholders holding a majority of the shares of US
Ecology common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled
to vote thereon to vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your
shares of US Ecology common stock or an abstention from voting on this proposal will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in
street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement.
What is the voting requirement to approve the advisory proposal on merger-related compensation?
Assuming that a quorum is present, the approval of the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-
related compensation requires that a majority of the votes cast at the Special Meeting be cast “FOR” the
advisory proposal. Assuming that a quorum is present, an abstention from voting on the non-binding
advisory proposal on merger-related compensation will have no effect on the advisory proposal. If your
shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the
nominee how to vote your shares, your failure to do so will have no effect on the non-binding advisory
proposal on merger-related compensation assuming that a quorum is present.
What is the voting requirement to approve the adjournment proposal?
Assuming that a quorum is present, the approval of the adjournment proposal requires that a majority of
the votes cast at the Special Meeting be cast “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Assuming that a quorum
is present, an abstention from voting on the adjournment proposal will have no effect on the
adjournment proposal. If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and

you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your failure to do so will have no effect on
the adjournment proposal assuming that a quorum is present.
How do US Ecology directors and executive officers intend to vote?
We currently expect that US Ecology directors and executive officers will vote their shares of US
Ecology common stock “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-binding
advisory proposal on merger-related compensation and “FOR” the adjournment proposal, although they
have no obligation to do so.
The directors and executive officers of US Ecology may have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of US Ecology stockholders generally. These interests are
described in more detail in the section entitled “Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger” beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become
payable by US Ecology to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
SEC rules require US Ecology to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or
may become payable by US Ecology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
What effects will the merger have on US Ecology and US Ecology’s common stock?
US Ecology common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is listed on Nasdaq
Global Select Market under the symbol “ECOL.” At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and
into US Ecology, with US Ecology continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Republic Services. As a result of the merger, US Ecology cease to be a publicly traded
company. Following the consummation of the merger, US Ecology common stock will be de-listed from
Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act.
What effects will the merger have on US Ecology equity awards?
At the effective time, each US Ecology stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time and that has an exercise price per share that is less than $48.00, whether or not vested, will
become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive, promptly after the
effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding
requirements) equal to the product of (i) the excess of $48.00 over the per-share exercise price of such
US Ecology stock option and (ii) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such US Ecology stock
option. Each US Ecology stock option with an exercise price equal to or greater than $48.00 will be
cancelled as of the effective time without payment of any consideration and will have no further force or
effect.
At the effective time, each performance stock unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive,
promptly after the effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax
withholding requirements) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares equal to the greater of (a) the
target number of shares with respect to such performance stock unit award and (b) the number of shares
that would be considered earned under the terms of such performance stock unit award based on the
most recent fiscal year-end results multiplied by (ii) $48.00.
At the effective time, each restricted share unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive,
promptly after the effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax
withholding requirements) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such restricted
share unit award and (ii) $48.00.
Further, at the effective time, each restricted share award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive,
promptly after the effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax

withholding requirements) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such restricted
share award and (ii) $48.00.
No US Ecology equity awards have been granted to any director, executive officer or employee of US
Ecology between the date of the Merger Agreement and the date of this Proxy Statement.
For additional details on the treatment of US Ecology stock options, performance stock units, restricted
share awards and restricted stock units in the merger, please see the section entitled “Treatment of US
Ecology Equity Awards in the Merger” beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.
What effects will the merger have on US Ecology warrants?
US Ecology warrants are currently registered under the Exchange Act, and are listed on the Nasdaq
Capital Market under the symbol “ECOLW.”  At the effective time, in accordance with the terms of
each warrant issued pursuant to that certain Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to the Warrant
Agreement between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, dated November 1,
2019, Republic Services will cause the surviving corporation to issue a replacement warrant to each
holder thereof that complies with and satisfies the applicable terms and conditions of the Warrant
Agreement, providing that such replacement warrant shall be exercisable for an amount in cash, without
interest, determined in accordance with the Warrant Agreement.
Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, if a holder of a warrant properly exercises such warrant within 30
days following the public disclosure of the consummation of the merger by US Ecology on Form 8-K,
the warrant price shall be reduced by an amount (in dollars) equal to the difference of the warrant price
in effect immediately prior to the consummation of the merger ($58.67 as of the date of this Proxy
Statement) minus (i) the difference of the merger consideration of $48.00 per share of US Ecology
common stock and (ii) the “Black-Scholes warrant value” as of immediately prior to the consummation of
the merger. The Black-Scholes value of a warrant means the value of a warrant based on the Black-
Scholes Warrant Model for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg Financial Markets. In the event that
the merger is ultimately completed, the Company intends to announce the adjusted warrant price of the
warrants concurrently with its announcement of the consummation of the merger. The warrants may be
exercised following the closing via cashless exercise.
Following the consummation of the merger, US Ecology warrants will be de-listed from the Nasdaq
Capital Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.
When is the merger expected to be completed?
Together with Republic Services, we are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible
after the date of the Special Meeting, and currently expect to consummate the merger by the end of the
second quarter. We cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the merger will be satisfied (or, to the
extent permitted, waived). The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied
(or, to the extent permitted, waived), including, among other things, the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by US Ecology stockholders.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by US Ecology stockholders, or if the merger is not completed
for any other reason, US Ecology stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of US
Ecology common stock in connection with the merger. Except in certain circumstances where US
Ecology has entered into an alternative transaction to the merger, US Ecology would remain a public
company, and shares of US Ecology common stock would continue to be registered under the Exchange
Act, as well as listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and US Ecology warrants would
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital
Market. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain specified circumstances, the
Company termination fee will be due and payable by US Ecology to Republic Services. See the sections
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination” and “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee” beginning
on page 80 of this Proxy Statement.
24 
Q: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote?
A: 
Q: 
A: 
Q: 
A: 
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken
at the Special Meeting by filing with the Secretary of the Company either an instrument revoking the
proxy or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Special Meeting and voting
thereat.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without
taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you
want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card or by sending a written notice of revocation to
US Ecology, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in
sufficient time for it to be received by US Ecology before the Special Meeting (which new proxy cards or
written notices of revocation should be received by or with our last mail delivery before the Special
Meeting begins in order to ensure that they will be counted).
If you hold your shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow
the instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or
submit new voting instructions. You may also revoke your proxy by obtaining further instructions from
your broker, bank or other nominee that holds the shares of record on how to obtain a proxy and
specific control number (as applicable) to vote your shares at the Special Meeting and voting your
shares at the Special Meeting.
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
The requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the
total number of shares of US Ecology common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date, not
just the shares that are voted. Failure to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy by phone or the
Internet or to vote via the Special Meeting website by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in
street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement. For more information concerning the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the
merger, please review this Proxy Statement and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as Annex A.
Assuming that a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast “FOR” each of
the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation and the adjournment proposal is
required to approve such proposals. Assuming that a quorum is present, an abstention from voting will
have no effect on the advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal and, if your shares are held in
street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, your failure to do so will have no effect on the advisory proposal or the adjournment
proposal.
Only shares of US Ecology common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the close of business
on the record date are eligible to be voted on each of the three proposals and will be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting.
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by US Ecology stockholders, the merger cannot close.
If the merger is consummated, how will I receive the cash for my shares of US Ecology common stock?
If the merger is consummated and your shares of US Ecology common stock are held in book-entry or in
the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, the cash proceeds will be deposited into your bank or
brokerage account without any further action on your part. If you hold your shares of US Ecology
common stock in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to
surrender your certificates that previously represented shares of US Ecology common stock to the
paying agent in connection with the merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check for
your shares of US Ecology common stock after you comply with such instructions. Employees of US
Ecology who hold outstanding US Ecology equity awards at the effective time will receive consideration
for those awards through payroll.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if the market price of shares of US Ecology’s common stock significantly changes before the
closing?
Republic Services is not obligated to change the merger consideration of $48.00 per share of US Ecology
common stock as a result of a change in the market price of US Ecology’s common stock.
What happens if I sell my shares of US Ecology common stock before completion of the merger?
In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of US Ecology common stock
through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of US Ecology common
stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger
consideration in the merger.
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is March 28, 2022. If you
transfer your shares of US Ecology common stock after the record date but before the closing, unless
you have granted a “legal proxy” to the purchaser as part of the transfer, you will have the right to vote
at the Special Meeting, although you will have transferred your right to receive the merger
consideration in the merger.
In addition, if you demand appraisal for any of your shares and thereafter sell such shares, you will no
longer be entitled to appraisal rights with respect to such shares.
Should I send in my evidence of ownership now?
No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal, if applicable, and related
materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for surrendering the
certificates, if any, representing the shares of US Ecology common stock held by you prior to the
consummation of the merger for the merger consideration. If your shares of US Ecology common stock
are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your
broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take in order to effect the surrender
of your street name shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Please do not send in any
documentation of evidence of ownership now.
Am I entitled to exercise dissenters’ or appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my
shares of US Ecology common stock?
Yes. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger
Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, but only if they fully comply with all applicable requirements of the DGCL,
which are summarized in this Proxy Statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be
more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise
appraisal rights for its shares must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to US
Ecology before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and such stockholder must not
vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement with respect to such
shares. Failure to comply exactly with the procedures and requirements specified under the DGCL will
result in the loss of appraisal rights. The discussion of appraisal rights contained in this Proxy
Statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified
in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached as Annex D to this Proxy
Statement. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on
page 88 of this Proxy Statement. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if
you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek the advice of your own
legal counsel.
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of US Ecology common stock for the merger
consideration pursuant to the merger?
Generally, yes, if you are a U.S. stockholder. The exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock for
the merger consideration pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Accordingly, an US Ecology stockholder that is a “U.S. holder”  (as defined in the section
26 
Q: 
A: 
Q: 
A: 
Q: 
A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
entitled “Proposal No. 1: The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 65 of this Proxy Statement) will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in the merger plus the
amount used to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the shares of US Ecology common stock exchanged therefor. With respect to an US Ecology
stockholder that is a “non-U.S. holder”  (as defined in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1: The Merger - 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 65 of this Proxy
Statement), the exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock for the merger consideration pursuant
to the merger generally will not result in tax to such non-U.S. holder under U.S. federal income tax laws
unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections with the United States. Backup withholding may
apply to the cash payment made pursuant to the merger unless the US Ecology stockholder or other
payee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures
(generally, by providing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 or applicable
successor form).
Each US Ecology stockholder is urged to read the discussion in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1: The
Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 65 of this Proxy
Statement and to consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-
U.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the merger.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to
determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or tax treaties.
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card?
If your shares of US Ecology common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one
account, you will receive more than one proxy or voting instruction form. Please complete and return all
of the proxy cards or voting instructions forms you receive (or submit each of your proxies or voting
instructions forms by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares of
US Ecology common stock are voted.
How many copies should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder?
Some banks, brokers and other nominees may participate in the practice of “householding” proxy
statements, annual reports and notices of Internet availability of proxy materials. This means that a
single set of our proxy materials, containing a single copy of this Proxy Statement but multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction forms, may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. You
may obtain a separate copy of our proxy materials if you contact Innisfree M&A Incorporated, our
proxy solicitor, at:

shares are registered in their name).

by stockholders who will have neither voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented
thereto in writing and who will have demanded and properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such

Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.
This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Board of the
Company, the Company’s management, the Company’s advisors, Republic Services, the Board of Directors of
Republic Services, Republic Services’ management, Republic Services’ advisors or any other person.
The Board and senior management of the Company regularly review and assess the Company’s business
strategies and objectives, and the Board regularly discusses the Company’s performance, risks and
29 TABLE OF CONTENTS
opportunities, all with the goal of enhancing stockholder value. As part of these ongoing efforts, the Board
and the Company’s senior management periodically evaluate various strategic alternatives, including the
continued operation of the Company as an independent, standalone company, acquiring new businesses to
complement or expand existing businesses, merging with or engaging in a strategic transaction with another
company, negotiating a sale of the Company with an industry participant or financial sponsor, divesting one
or more of the Company’s businesses, reducing the Company’s outstanding debt, and entering into strategic
partnerships or other investments with respect to one or more of the Company’s businesses. In considering
all available alternatives, the Board and the Company’s senior management take into account current and
potential economic, political and social conditions and developments, trends in the industries in which the
Company operates, and any macro-level drivers of change and uncertainty (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)
impacting the public markets. In addition, the Company and its representatives have been approached
periodically by other companies and their representatives regarding potential interest in a material
transaction involving the Company.
In December 2019, an unprecedented new coronavirus disease, referred to as COVID-19, began spreading
around the world. The virus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,
2020 and a national emergency by the President of the United States on March 13, 2020, prompted
government authorities throughout the world to institute quarantines, travel restrictions, mandated business
closures, masking requirements, lockdown orders and other restrictions in an effort to contain its spread. The
COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to it resulted in virtually unprecedented turbulence
and uncertainty throughout the globe, impacting peoples’ lives, health and safety as well as the economy
and the financial markets. Like many other companies throughout the world, the Company’s financial
condition was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to address the market volatility and economic uncertainty induced by market conditions coinciding
with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board determined to shore up its defenses against potential hostile third
party actors seeking to exploit the Company’s temporarily depressed stock price, while also evaluating the
viability of various strategic alternatives and the strength and health of the Company’s corporate
governance practices with a goal of maximizing stockholder value. As a result of these efforts, the Board
would ultimately adopt and recommend that its stockholders adopt a number of modifications to the
Company’s organizational documents, as described in greater detail below. As part of that effort, on August
24, 2020, the Company engaged Houlihan Lokey to serve as the Company’s exclusive financial advisor in
connection with various matters relating to stockholder activism, including any demand, whether publicly or
privately, for changes in the Company’s strategy, governance, Board composition or management team.
Meanwhile, the Company began to receive inbound indications of interest from potential transaction
counterparties: On December 11, 2020, Party A delivered an unsolicited letter expressing an interest in
acquiring 100% of the Company’s common stock at a value of $46.60 per share, and on December 14, 2020,
Party B delivered an unsolicited letter expressing an interest in acquiring 100% of the Company’s common
stock at a value range of $44.00-$46.00 per share. The proposals from both Party A and Party B were subject
to a number of conditions, including, in each case, the satisfactory completion of due diligence on the
Company, the negotiation of mutually agreeable definitive transaction documentation, approval by the
Company’s stockholders, and the receipt of any required antitrust and other regulatory approvals. The
closing price of the Company’s common stock was $36.20 as of December 11, 2020 and $36.63 as of December
14, 2020.
In light of the inbound inquiries the Company had received regarding a potential strategic transaction, the
Company engaged both Houlihan Lokey and Barclays, to provide financial advisory services in connection
with any such strategic transaction, including, in each case and if requested by the Company, the delivery
by Barclays or Houlihan Lokey (as applicable) of an opinion to the Board with respect to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the Company’s stockholders of the consideration to be offered in a particular
strategic transaction to such stockholders.
On January 15, 2021, the Board and senior management met and heard a presentation from Dechert LLP
(“Dechert”), the Company’s legal advisors, regarding the application of directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law in connection with various potential transaction types. In addition, representatives of
Barclays and Houlihan Lokey reviewed with the Board a preliminary financial analysis of the Company. The
30 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board, senior management, and the Company’s legal and financial advisors also discussed the Company’s
intrinsic value, historical stock performance and long-term value considerations as well as potential
protective measures which the Company could put in place to minimize the possibility that hostile actors
could successfully exploit the Company’s depressed stock price during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following
these presentations, the Board adopted amendments to the Company’s bylaws which included provisions
requiring advance notice of director nominations and that certain disputes be litigated in an exclusive forum.
Finally, the Board, senior management, and the Company’s legal and financial advisors discussed the offers
from Party A and Party B. The independent directors on the Board also met separately in executive session
to discuss, among other things, the Company’s intrinsic value as an independent, standalone company as
compared to the offers from Party A and Party B. Following extensive deliberation on the merits of each of
these offers, the Board concluded that neither offer was sufficient to serve as the basis for further
negotiations. Company management informed Party A and Party B of this determination, and neither Party A
nor Party B pursued the matter further at that time.
On February 24, 2021, Party C, an activist stockholder, informed the Company that it had become a
significant stockholder of the Company. Following discussions with Party C, the Company arranged for Party
C to meet virtually with its Chief Financial Officer on March 9, 2021 and to meet virtually with its Chief
Executive Officer on April 13, 2021.
On April 13, 2021, the Company filed its definitive proxy statement with respect to the Company’s 2021
Annual Meeting of Stockholders with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon its
consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of such course of action following consultations with
the Company’s legal and financial advisors, the Company proposed in its proxy statement a number of
potential protective measures which the Company recommended putting in place to minimize the possibility
that hostile actors could successfully exploit the Company’s depressed stock price as well as additional
changes to improve the Company’s corporate governance policies and practices. Specifically, among other
things, the Company proposed to further amend its organizational documents to eliminate cumulative voting
in director elections, to adopt a plurality voting standard for contested director elections and to establish a
proxy access bylaw. At the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 25, 2021, the Company’s
stockholders approved each of these proposals.
On July 23, 2021, Party C sent a private letter to the Company’s Board and Chief Executive Officer, outlining
its investment thesis regarding the Company and expressing concern regarding the underperformance of the
Company’s stock relative to other companies in the same industries and the Company’s capital allocation
decisions. Party C requested additional meetings with the Company’s independent directors on the Board to
further discuss their concerns. The Company arranged for Party C to meet virtually with two of its
independent directors on August 16, 2021 and again virtually on September 13, 2021. During these meetings
Party C outlined its investment thesis for the Company. In particular, in its communications with the
Company, Party C expressed its opinion that the Company’s capital allocation history was questionable and,
more specifically, that the Company overpaid for its acquisition of NRC Group Holdings Corp. in November
2019. In these communications, Party C expressed its opinion that the Board should consider exploring
strategic alternatives.
On August 31, 2021, Party D’s Executive Chairman and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer held a
discussion during which Party D disclosed receiving an unsolicited inbound communication from Party C
presenting Party C’s investment thesis on the Company and inquiring if Party D would have any interest in
pursuing an acquisition of the Company. In this discussion, Party D indicated to the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer that Party D would not have interest in pursuing a transaction with the Company.
On September 7, 2021, Party B and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer met to discuss current industry
trends and business challenges. During this discussion, Party B expressed continued interest in pursuing a
transaction with the Company, but noted that Party B would likely need to pay a significant portion of the
transaction consideration using its stock instead of cash, given Party B’s recent announcement of another
transaction.
On October 7, 2021, Party C sent a private letter to the Board again criticizing the Company’s long-term stock
price performance and capital allocation policies, in particular the Board’s decision to acquire NRC
31 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Group Holdings Corp. in November 2019. In its letter, Party C requested that the Board initiate an immediate
sale process or, alternatively, suggested that members of the Company’s senior leadership team should be
replaced.
On October 22, 2021, the Chief Development Officer of Republic Services contacted one of the Company’s
independent directors to inquire who Republic Services should contact to initiate a discussion regarding
exploring a strategic transaction. Following this outreach, on October 23, 2021, the respective Chief
Executive Officers of the Company and Republic Services discussed, among other things, an overview of the
Company’s businesses, as well as the possible synergies that could result from an acquisition of the
Company by Republic Services. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer then communicated the content of
the discussion to the Board by email on October 23, 2021.
On October 26, 2021, the respective Chief Executive Officers of the Company and Republic Services
discussed Republic Services’ continued interest in a potential transaction involving the Company and the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer suggested that Republic Services submit an offer in writing.
Also on October 26, 2021, Party A contacted the Company again and reiterated its interest in a potential
transaction involving the Company.
On November 3, 2021, Republic Services’ Chief Executive Officer contacted the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and submitted a verbal proposal, which was then submitted in writing on the same day, to acquire
100% of the Company’s common stock at a value of between $40.00 and $42.00 per share on an all-cash
basis. The closing price of the Company’s common stock as of November 3, 2021 was $32.82. The letter
provided that Republic Services’ offer was subject to due diligence and negotiation of a definitive
agreement.
On November 10, 2021 and November 11, 2021, the Board convened a regular meeting to discuss, in addition
to the Board’s regular business, the status of the Company’s review of strategic alternatives to date,
including the Company’s strategic plan and the offers and indications of interest the Company had received.
In order to prepare for considering potential strategic alternatives, the Board heard an updated presentation
from Dechert regarding the application of directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law in connection with
various potential transactions. In addition, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey reviewed with
the Board an updated preliminary financial analysis of the Company. The Board and its legal and financial
advisors then discussed various strategic alternatives under consideration, including the future prospects of
the Company on a standalone basis, and the risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives. Upon
the conclusion of this meeting, the Board authorized senior management to continue preliminary discussions
with Republic Services and other prospective counterparties regarding a potential strategic transaction with
the Company. However, after this meeting and at the direction of the Board, Company management expressed
to Republic Services on November 15, 2021 its view that, while Republic Services’ offer price range
represented a premium to the current market value of the Company’s common stock, it nevertheless
represented a discount to the Company’s intrinsic value, and that Republic Services would need to increase
its offer price significantly in order for the Company to seriously entertain Republic Services’ offer.
On November 16, 2021, the Company had an introductory meeting with Party E, another party which had
expressed an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, to provide an overview of the Company’s
business.
On November 19, 2021, Party E expressed an interest in acquiring 100% of the Company’s common stock at a
value of between $48.00 to $56.00 per share. The closing price of the Company’s common stock as of
November 19, 2021 was $34.98. The proposal from Party E was subject to a number of conditions, including
the satisfactory completion of due diligence on the Company and the negotiation of mutually agreeable
definitive transaction documentation. Party E also requested a three-week period of limited exclusivity during
which the Company could still engage with prospective counterparties who made unsolicited offers
regarding a potential strategic transaction. The letter from Party E stated that Party E could complete its due
diligence expeditiously with limited time commitment from management and provide a firm offer by December
15, 2021. On November 23, 2021, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer met with Party E to obtain
clarifications about Party E’s proposal, including Party E’s expectations surrounding financing, exclusivity,
and the level of due diligence that was expected to be required.
32 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 29, 2021, following the initial discussions with Party E, the Board met and discussed Party E’s
indication of interest. The Board authorized management to negotiate a nondisclosure agreement with Party
E, but only on a non-exclusive basis. At this meeting of the Board, the Board also established a transaction
committee to oversee the Company’s exploration of potential strategic alternatives, including, but not limited
to, a potential transaction with Republic Services, Party E or any other interested party. The transaction
committee (“Transaction Committee”) was comprised of Daniel Fox, Richard Burke, Katina Dorton, and Glenn
A. Eisenburg, with Richard Burke as chairman, and the goal of the Transaction Committee was to allow the
Board to expeditiously and efficiently explore a potential merger or sale of, or other strategic transaction
involving, the Company, to keep the Board fully informed and ultimately make a recommendation regarding
any such transaction to the full Board. At this meeting representatives of Dechert also made a preliminary
report to the Board on their views of the potential antitrust risks that would arise in attempting to complete a
transaction with various proposed counterparties, including Republic Services, Party A, Party B and Party E.
In light of the status of its exploration of strategic alternatives to date, on November 30, 2021, the Company
agreed to extend the term of its engagement of Houlihan Lokey. The Company would likewise agree to extend
the term of its engagement of Barclays on January 10, 2022.
On December 1, 2021, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer had a call with a representative of Party E to
discuss Party E’s indication of interest. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer confirmed that the Company
was willing to engage in discussions about a potential transaction at the value range set forth in Party E’s
indication of interest but that the Company would not entertain exclusivity at that time.
Also on December 1, 2021, representatives of Dechert sent to Party E a draft nondisclosure agreement, which
the Company and Party E negotiated until its execution on December 8, 2021. Among other things the
nondisclosure agreement contained a standstill provision in favor of the Company for one year which would
fall away upon the announcement by the Company of the Company’s entry into a definitive agreement with
respect to a strategic transaction with a party other than Party E.
On December 2, 2021, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey had initial conversations with
representatives of Party E on behalf of the Company.
On December 3, 2021, Republic Services’ Chief Development Officer reached out to one of the Company’s
independent directors seeking more clarity on how Republic Services and the Company could potentially
move forward towards a negotiated transaction. In response, on December 8, 2021, the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer contacted Republic Services’ Chief Development Officer and expressed the view that, based
on prior discussions with the Board, Republic Services would need to increase the valuation range stated in
Republic Services’ November 3, 2021 offer to a price of $50.00 per share or more in order for the Company to
seriously entertain Republic Services’ offer.
On December 9, 2021, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey sent a proposed nondisclosure
agreement on behalf of the Company to Republic Services’ Chief Development Officer.
On December 10, 2021, financial advisors for Republic Services and the Company discussed a potential
transaction.
Between December 11, 2021 and December 21, 2021, members of the Company’s senior management, at the
direction of the Transaction Committee, engaged in multiple discussions with Party E regarding a potential
transaction with the Company, exchanging information and answering numerous diligence requests made by
Party E.
On December 17, 2021, Republic Services submitted a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the Company’s
common stock at an increased valuation of $51.00 per share on an all-cash basis. The closing price of the
Company’s common stock as of December 17, 2021 was $30.68. The proposal from Republic Services was
subject to a number of conditions, including the satisfactory completion of due diligence on the Company
and the negotiation of mutually agreeable definitive transaction documentation, though Republic Services
specifically indicated that no financing condition would be required. Republic Services also requested an
eight-week period of exclusivity. Furthermore, Republic Services’ letter noted that, while Republic Services
preferred a collaborative, consensual transaction, Republic Services reserved the right to
33 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
pursue all necessary steps to ensure that the Company’s stockholders were provided with the opportunity to
realize the value inherent in Republic Services’ revised proposal.
On December 17, 2021, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the current progress of negotiations with
Party E and the revised proposal from Republic Services. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer reported to
the Transaction Committee that Party E needed to review and understand additional due diligence
information in order to provide a firm offer. The Transaction Committee also reviewed the Company’s
financial projections.
On December 21, 2021, the full Board met to discuss the remaining counterparties interested in a potential
transaction with the Company, the financial projections for the Company’s future outlook on a standalone
basis as an independent Company and the Company’s 2022 annual budget. The Board also discussed, in
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, Republic Services’ request for exclusivity and determined,
in particular in consideration that there were other interested parties with whom the Company was in active
discussions, that the Company could not grant exclusivity to Republic Services or any other party at that
time.
On December 22, 2021, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Party A held discussions, during which
Party A expressed its continued interest in a potential transaction with the Company. The Company’s Chief
Executive Officer indicated that if Party A remained interested, Party A should review and revise its previous
December 11, 2020 proposal.
On December 23, 2021, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer telephoned Republic Services’ Chief Executive
Officer and indicated Republic Services’ latest proposal was well received and that the Company would be
willing to engage in further discussions after entering into a nondisclosure agreement with a customary
standstill provision. Furthermore, the Company indicated it would not be able to enter into an exclusivity
agreement at that time.
Meanwhile, between December 20, 2021 and January 6, 2022, the Company continued separate discussions
with Party E, as well as responding to additional diligence and information requests from Party E.
On January 5, 2022, Republic Services’ Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
discussed Republic Services’ offer and Republic Services’ request for exclusivity, and the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer proposed a joint management meeting during the week of January 17, 2022.
On January 6, 2022, Republic Services’ Chief Executive Officer communicated to the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer that Republic Services would be willing to move forward to entering into a nondisclosure
agreement with a customary standstill provision.
On January 7 and January 8, 2022, financial advisors for Republic Services and the Company continued to
discuss a potential transaction. In addition, on January 8, 2022, Republic Services’ Chief Legal Officer sent
comments on the draft nondisclosure agreement to Dechert.
On January 7, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of discussions with Republic
Services, Party A, and Party E regarding a potential transaction with the Company. Representatives of
Barclays and Houlihan Lokey reported that in their respective discussions with Party E, at the direction of
the Company, they had requested that Party E refine its proposed valuation based on the due diligence work
done to date and provide the Company with an indication of Party E’s remaining diligence-related open items
along with Party E’s estimates for when it might be able to conclude its due diligence process. The
representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey reported that Party E had indicated that providing a firm
offer based on the information that had been provided as of that time would be difficult, and in any event,
such offer would not be at the higher end of the range that they had previously provided.
On January 11, 2022, members of the Company’s senior management met with representatives of Party A to
discuss, among other things, current business conditions and industry conditions. During this conversation
Party A indicated that it remained interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company and intended to
submit an updated indication of interest to acquire the Company.
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 11, 2022, the Company and Republic Services executed a nondisclosure agreement, which, among
other things, included a nine-month standstill obligation in favor of the Company.
On January 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of negotiations with Republic
Services, Party A, and Party E regarding a potential transaction with the Company. The Company’s Chief
Executive Officer explained that the Company was still awaiting an updated proposal from Party A, and the
Transaction Committee directed the Company’s Chief Executive Officer to communicate to Party A that it
should submit a revised offer in the near term if it remained interested in a potential transaction with the
Company. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer also explained that Party E had now communicated to the
Company’s financial advisors on January 11, 2022 that it was withdrawing its proposal and would not be able
to provide a firm offer at this time without receiving significantly more due diligence information. In
particular, Party E cited concerns about the Company’s most recent financial performance and the prospect
of a negative market reaction to the Company’s financial performance in 2022. The Transaction Committee
and senior management discussed their shared views that, taking into account the process that had taken
place up to that time, Party E was not likely to make a firm offer at a level that would be attractive to the
Company’s stockholders and that a transaction was more likely to materialize with Republic Services than
with any other potential counterparty. The Transaction Committee therefore authorized senior management
to continue negotiations with Republic Services and authorized Dechert to begin preparing potential
definitive documentation for a possible transaction with Republic Services.
Over the course of January 13, 2022 to January 18, 2022, Company’s management team held various meetings
with Republic Services’ management team, including in-person due diligence meetings on January 17 and 18,
2022.
On January 21, 2022, Party A contacted the Company’s Chief Executive Officer indicating Party A had
conducted more due diligence based on publicly available information and would be submitting an offer
shortly. It was communicated to Party A that if Party A was still seriously interested, it was in Party A’s best
interest to submit a revised proposal imminently.
On January 25, 2022, Republic Services submitted verbally a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the
Company’s common stock at a value of $48.00 per share on an all-cash basis. Republic Services explained
that the reasons for its reduction in price from $51.00 per share to $48.00 per share were weakness in the
Company’s fourth quarter results, increased capital expenditure needs for the business which exceeded their
previous expectations and lower than expected cost synergies that could be achieved from the transaction.
Republic Services submitted a written offer confirming the terms on January 27, 2022.
On January 25, 2022, Party E contacted the Company’s Chief Executive Officer to request a meeting to
discuss a potential alternative transaction structure. A meeting date for January 31, 2022 was set to hold
such discussions.
On January 26, 2022, the Board, Company management, Dechert, and representatives of Barclays and
Houlihan Lokey met to discuss, among other things, Republic Services’ revised proposal. The Board along
with representatives of its legal and financial advisors discussed the process the Company and the Board
had followed to date to evaluate the offers received, and the factors the Board should consider in deciding
on its next steps, including the offers received to date, the likelihood of offers that could reasonably be
expected to be received from other parties if solicited, and the disclosure, timing and antitrust risk that could
be associated with those offers. The Board then further discussed the Company’s strategic plan and its
prospects as an independent, standalone company as compared to the immediate value presented by the
most recent offer received from Republic Services. Following discussion, the Board agreed that the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer should reach out to Republic Services and propose a counteroffer price
of $50.00 per share. Furthermore, on January 27, 2022, Dechert sent an initial draft of a proposed form of
merger agreement to Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (“Davis Polk”), counsel to Republic Services.
On January 27, 2022, the Board, Company management, Dechert and representatives of Barclays and
Houlihan Lokey again met to discuss the status of the negotiations with Republic Services. The Company’s
Chief Executive Officer reported to the Board that he had communicated the suggested counteroffer price of
$50.00 per share, but Republic Services had responded, and confirmed in writing, that $48.00 per share
represented its best and final offer, which offer was contingent upon receiving exclusivity through
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
February 8, 2022. After additional deliberation on the merits of Republic Services’ proposal as opposed to the
other strategic alternatives reasonably available, including continuing on as an independent, standalone
company, and with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, the Board agreed that Republic Services’ offer
price of $48.00 per share price represented a more attractive value for the Company’s common stock at that
time, and accordingly, directed senior management for the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement
with Republic Services through February 8, 2022. By the end of the day on January 27, 2022, the Company
and Republic Services had reached agreement on the proposed terms of exclusivity and, accordingly, the
Company and Republic Services entered into an exclusivity agreement providing that, from such date until
February 8, 2022, the Company could not solicit or participate in discussions with other third parties
regarding a potential transaction involving the Company. On January 30, 2022, the Company Chief Executive
Officer canceled the scheduled meeting with Party E due to the exclusivity agreement with Republic Services.
On January 31, 2022, the Company and Republic Services entered into a “clean team” agreement, which
addressed the disclosure of potentially competitively sensitive information between the Company and
Republic Services. Also on January 31, 2022, Davis Polk sent Republic Services’ initial comments to the draft
Merger Agreement to Dechert, and it was communicated by the Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services
to Mr. Feeler that there would not likely be a role for Mr. Feeler with the surviving corporation following the
transaction.
Also on January 31, 2022, Party A submitted a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the Company’s common
stock at a value of $46.60 per share on an all-cash basis, subject to a number of conditions, including the
satisfactory completion of due diligence on the Company (which they expected to take up to ninety days),
the negotiation of mutually agreeable definitive transaction documentation, all required regulatory approvals
and the approval of the Company’s stockholders. The letter also stated that Party A had sufficient capital to
finance the equity portion of the transaction. The Company did not substantively respond to this inquiry
due to the exclusivity agreement it had entered into with Republic Services.
On February 1, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of the Merger Agreement, due
diligence and ongoing negotiation efforts. At this meeting, the Transaction Committee was informed of Party
A’s revised offer and that the Company had not substantively responded due to the Company’s exclusivity
obligations to Republic Services. The Transaction Committee, members of management and the Company’s
legal and financial advisors discussed the timing and due diligence process that would need to occur with
Party A were the Company to pursue Party A’s offer, and considered that the outcome and timing of such a
process was likely to not be dissimilar to what the Company had recently experienced with Party E and that it
was highly uncertain whether, at the conclusion of the process, Party A would increase its offer price to an
amount in excess of the $48.00 per share offered by Republic Services.
On February 3, 2022, Dechert sent an initial draft of the disclosure schedules to the draft Merger Agreement
to Davis Polk.
On February 5, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of negotiations and to consider
the open issues that remained in such negotiations. Representatives of Dechert also provided the
Transaction Committee with an overview of various possible negotiated solutions to the antitrust risk
allocation provisions in the Merger Agreement, which remained the most significant open unresolved issue
with Republic Services. From February 5, 2022 to February 8, 2022, Dechert and Davis Polk continued to
negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement and disclosure schedules on behalf of the Company and
Republic Services, respectively.
On February 6, 2022, the Company and Republic Services exchanged limited financial information intended to
assess potential overlaps. On February 7, 2022, members of management from both Republic Services and the
Company and antitrust specialists from both Dechert and Davis Polk discussed the potential overlaps in the
businesses of Republic Services and the Company.
On February 7, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of negotiations with Republic
Services as well as its and its legal advisors’ ongoing evaluation of the antitrust risk allocation provisions of
the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 8, 2022, the entire Board met to discuss the status of negotiations with Republic Services.
Dechert reviewed with the Board the principal terms of the Merger Agreement, including the proposed final
outcome of the antitrust risk allocation provisions, and also reviewed with the Board again the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law in connection with the proposed transaction. At the request of the
Board, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey then reviewed with the Board their respective
financial analyses of the $48.00 per share consideration offered by Republic Services. Thereafter, at the
request of the Board, Barclays rendered its opinion (attached as Annex B to this proxy statement) to the
Board to the effect that as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and
assumptions stated in its written opinion, the consideration to be offered to the holders of the Company’s
common stock (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) in the proposed transaction was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. In addition, at the request of the Board, Houlihan Lokey rendered its
opinion (attached as Annex C to this proxy statement) to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of the
Company’s common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such holders from a
financial point of view. The Board and its legal and financial advisors then discussed the structure and terms
of the proposed transaction and, after deliberation and consideration of the factors described under
“Reasons for Recommendation” beginning on page 37 of this Proxy Statement and upon the recommendation
of the Transaction Committee, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and in the best interests of, and fair to, the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) authorized and approved the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be
submitted for consideration at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and (iv) resolved to
make the recommendation that the stockholders of the Company adopt and approve the Merger Agreement.
Following the conclusion of the Board meeting, the Company and Republic Services agreed to and finalized
the Merger Agreement and the accompanying disclosure schedules on terms consistent with the terms
approved by the Board. Prior to the opening of U.S. stock markets on February 9, 2022, the Company and
Republic Services executed and exchanged the definitive documentation and issued a joint press release
publicly announcing their entry into the Merger Agreement.
Recommendation of the Board
After considering the various factors described below, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, are fair to, and in the best interests of, US Ecology and its
stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, including the execution, delivery,
and performance thereof, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (iii) directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of US Ecology’s stockholders for adoption at the Special Meeting;
and (iv) resolved to recommend that US Ecology’s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
Reasons for Recommendation
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the merger, the Board consulted with US Ecology’s senior
management and its outside financial advisors and legal counsel and, in reaching its determination to
recommend that US Ecology stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board relied upon and
considered numerous factors, including the material factors set forth below (provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the order in which such factors appear does not reflect any relative significance):
Financial Terms and Certainty of Value - The Board believes the following with respect to the financial
terms of the Merger Agreement:
The belief of the Board that the merger consideration of $48.00 per share in cash of US Ecology
common stock represents full and fair value for shares of US Ecology common stock, taking into
account the interests of US Ecology’s stockholders as a whole, and not the interests of any
individual stockholder, US Ecology’s current and historical financial condition, results of operations,
business,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
competitive position and prospects, as well as US Ecology’s near-term and long-term standalone plan
in the event US Ecology were to remain an independent public company, and the future prospects
and risks associated with remaining an independent, standalone company and the risks and
uncertainties associated with the execution of the standalone plan.
The opportunity for US Ecology’s stockholders to realize substantial value based on the receipt of
the merger consideration representing a significant premium of (i) 70% to the closing share price of
February 8, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger, and a premium of
approximately 62% to the 30-day volume weighted average price of February 8, 2022 and (ii) 79% to
the closing share price of February 7, 2022, the last trading day prior to the publication by Bloomberg
of an article claiming that US Ecology and Republic Services were in advanced negotiations regarding
a potential transaction.
The fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, which provides certainty of value and
liquidity to the stockholders of US Ecology and does not expose them to any future risks related to
the business or the financial markets generally, as compared to a transaction in which stockholders
receive equity or other securities, or as compared to remaining an independent, standalone company.
The financial analysis reviewed by Barclays with the Board as well as the oral opinion of Barclays
(which oral opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of
February 8, 2022), provided to the Board, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject
to the qualifications, limitations, conditions and assumptions set forth in such opinion and other
matters considered in preparation thereof, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of
US Ecology common stock (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) in the merger is fair, from
a financial point of view, to such holders. A copy of the written opinion of Barclays is attached as
Annex B to this Proxy Statement, and such written opinion is also described more fully in the
“Opinions of Financial Advisors” section of this Proxy Statement.
The financial analysis reviewed by Houlihan Lokey with the Board as well as the opinion of Houlihan
Lokey rendered to the Board on February 8, 2022 to the effect that, as of such date and based upon
and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received
by the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair
to such holders from a financial point of view. A copy of the written opinion of Houlihan Lokey is
attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement, and such written opinion is also described more fully in
the “Opinions of Financial Advisors” section of this Proxy Statement.
The fact that appraisal rights will be available to the holders of US Ecology common stock who
properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these stockholders the ability to
seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the “fair value” of their shares of US Ecology
common stock if they do not wish to accept the merger consideration.
The fact that the merger consideration Republic Services agreed pay to the holders of US Ecology
common stock was increased from Republic Services’ initial offer of between $40.00 and $42.00 per
share of US Ecology common stock to the final negotiated merger consideration price of $48.00 per
share of US Ecology common stock as a result of extensive arms’-length negotiations, as described in
the “Background of the Merger” section of this Proxy Statement.
The fact that the parties have agreed that all outstanding stock options, performance stock units,
restricted share awards and restricted stock units of US Ecology, whether vested or unvested, under
the Amended and Restated US Ecology, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan will automatically vest and settle
in cash based on the value of the merger consideration, rather than being assumed by, and converted
into equity awards of, Republic Services, which provides certainty of value and liquidity to holders of
US Ecology equity awards and does not expose them to the risk of lost value based on Republic
Services’ performance or future risks related to the financial markets generally.
Prospects of US Ecology - The Board believes that the consummation of the transactions represent US
Ecology’s best reasonably available alternative for maximizing stockholder value based upon the Board’s
review of US Ecology’s current and historical business, financial condition, results of operations,
competitive position, strategic options and prospects, as well as US Ecology’s near-term and long-term

TABLE OF CONTENTS
standalone plan in the event US Ecology were to remain an independent public company, the risks and
challenges associated with remaining an independent public company and the risks and uncertainties
associated with the execution of the standalone plan, and the potential impact of those factors on the future
trading price of US Ecology common stock, including risks related to:
The general business environment for the industries in which US Ecology operates, including
industry trends, increased labor, transportation and fuel costs, customer supply chain disruptions,
high levels of capital expenditures, and substantial governmental regulation and involvement;
The costs, risks and uncertainties relating to the execution by US Ecology of its near-term and
long-term standalone plan in the event US Ecology were to remain an independent public
company factoring in ongoing COVID-19 pandemic related challenges to labor markets,
inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and general investor sentiment toward
commodity exposed businesses and less predictable end markets;
The additional costs and burdens involved with being a public company;
The U.S. and global economy and general stock market conditions and volatility;
The adverse impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the government and other
restrictions imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain or mitigate the COVID-19
pandemic, on US Ecology’s operations; and
The other risks and uncertainties identified in US Ecology’s filings with the SEC, including in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Process and Consideration of Alternatives - The Board believes the following with respect to the process it
has taken which resulted in the execution of the Merger Agreement with Republic Services and the
alternative options reasonably available:
The Board’s belief, based on a review of the possible alternatives to a sale of US Ecology, including
the prospects of continuing to operate in accordance with the near-term and long-term strategic plan,
the potential value to US Ecology stockholders of such alternatives and the timing and likelihood of
actually achieving additional value for such stockholders from these alternatives, that none of these
options, on a risk- and time-adjusted basis, was reasonably likely to create value for US Ecology
stockholders greater than the merger consideration.
The fact that US Ecology had preliminary discussions with respect to a potential material transaction
involving US Ecology with a number of other potential strategic and financial counterparties since
January 2021 and continuing in 2022, none of which provided any indication that they were willing
and able to complete a transaction on terms that were more favorable to US Ecology’s stockholders
than the proposal made by Republic Services, as described in the “Background of the Merger” section
of this Proxy Statement.
The determination by the Board, after discussion with US Ecology’s senior management, that
Republic Services was the most logical acquirer of US Ecology and, in light of US Ecology’s
complementary businesses, as well as the projected synergies that would result from the combination,
together with Republic Services’ strong balance sheet and financial position, that Republic Services
would be the potential transaction partner most likely to offer the best combination of value and
closing certainty to US Ecology’s stockholders.
The Board’s beliefs that an all-cash transaction represented a more attractive opportunity for US
Ecology’s stockholders than a potentially more complicated, less liquid form of consideration that
may be offered by other counterparties, such as equity securities, or a mix of cash and stock.
The Board’s beliefs that a transaction with a strategic operating company with complementary
businesses was more likely to unlock value for US Ecology’s stockholders than a transaction with a
financial buyer, particularly in light of the heightened risks associated with financing uncertainty
based on the Company’s recent operating results and the complications and challenges that may
result from the extensive due diligence process that would be necessary in attempting to partner with
a counterparty with less complete understanding of US Ecology’s businesses and the industries and
markets in which it operates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board’s concerns, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the pool of potential
strategic partners with sufficient market capitalization and resources to act as an acquirer of US
Ecology was limited considerably by the fact that certain prospective acquirers were competitors of
US Ecology that would present heightened risk that a negotiated transaction would ultimately be
prohibited or significantly constrained or changed by regulatory authorities due to antitrust
concerns.
The Board’s beliefs that there were no other credible potential parties that might have an interest in
engaging in a strategic transaction with US Ecology at a value higher than Republic Services’
proposal, that the potential regulatory, commercial and financing issues that might arise in connection
with pursuing such an alternative transaction, and that Republic Services would withdraw from
consideration of a potential transaction if US Ecology were to pursue discussions with other
potential counterparties.
The fact that, even upon entering into the Merger Agreement, the “fiduciary out” provisions (as more
fully described in the “Board Recommendation; Change of Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception” section
of this Proxy Statement) and relatively modest termination fee (including as more fully described in
the “Termination Fee” section of this Proxy Statement) ensured that US Ecology’s stockholders would
still have an opportunity to realize the benefits of a potential alternative transaction in the event
another counterparty emerged following the announcement of US Ecology’s entry into the Merger
Agreement and expressed a willingness to acquire US Ecology at a more advantageous price to US
Ecology stockholders.
The Board’s beliefs that Republic Services was the potential counterparty interested in proceeding
with an acquisition of US Ecology that represented the most attractive combination of (i) the highest
per share price offered after complete due diligence, (ii) an expeditious timeline to closing, (iii) less
potential antitrust risk than other potential counterparties, and (iv) a high degree of closing certainty.
Likelihood of Consummation - The Board believes the transaction is likely to be consummated for the
following reasons:
The business reputation and capabilities of Republic Services and its management.
The fact that Republic Services’ obligation to complete the transactions is not conditioned on
Republic Services or Merger Sub obtaining financing.
The fact that the Merger Agreement requires Republic Services to use its reasonable best efforts to
take actions necessary to satisfy the regulatory conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and
includes a commitment by Republic Services to obtain applicable consents and approvals under
antitrust laws and assume the risks related to certain conditions and requirements that may be
imposed by regulators in connection with securing such consents and approvals up to specified
thresholds and limitations, as more fully described in the “Efforts to Complete the Merger; Regulatory
Approvals” section of this Proxy Statement.
Terms of the Merger Agreement - The Board believes the following with respect to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the merger:
The Board considered all of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties, the conditions to closing, the
form of the merger consideration and the termination rights, including:
That the terms of the Merger Agreement were the products of arms’-length negotiations among
sophisticated parties and their respective legal and financial advisors, as more fully described in
the “Background of the Merger” section of this Proxy Statement;
That the “fiduciary out” provisions, subject to US Ecology’s compliance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, give the Board the ability to furnish information to, and
engage in negotiations with, third parties that have made an unsolicited bona fide written
Takeover Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement, which definition is summarized below)
that is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger
Agreement, which definition is summarized below) and, upon payment of a termination fee and

compliance with the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, terminate the Merger
Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as more fully
described in the “No Solicitation; Takeover Proposals” section of this Proxy Statement);
That the Board has the ability in certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, to
change, qualify, withdraw or modify its recommendation that US Ecology stockholders vote to
adopt the Merger Agreement (as more fully described in the “Board Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception” section of this Proxy Statement);
The fact that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by US Ecology or Republic Services under
certain circumstances relating to the merger being prohibited as a result of an applicable antitrust law
or governmental order, Republic Services will be required to reimburse US Ecology for 50% of its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger up to
$5,000,000 (i.e., Republic Services’ reimbursement shall not exceed $2,500,000).
The fact that, subject to certain customary limitations, US Ecology will have sufficient operating
flexibility for it to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the
pre-closing period;
The fact that the conditions to the closing are specific and limited in scope;
The fact that a vote of US Ecology stockholders is required under the DGCL to adopt the Merger
Agreement; and
That the remedies of specific performance and monetary damages are available to US Ecology under
the Merger Agreement as more fully described in the “Limitations on Remedies; Specific Performance”
section of this Proxy Statement.
In addition to the factors above, the Board identified and considered a variety of risks and potentially
negative factors concerning the merger, including:
The fact that US Ecology’s stockholders will lose the opportunity to realize additional potential long-
term value through US Ecology’s successful execution as an independent, standalone company.
The possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and the risks and costs to US Ecology in
such event, including the diversion of management and employee attention and the potential
disruptive effect on US Ecology’s businesses, customer and vendor relationships, stock price and
ability to attract and retain key management personnel and employees;
The possibility that completion of the merger might be delayed or subject to adverse conditions that
may be imposed by governmental authorities that are not within US Ecology’s control, that the
required governmental approvals may not be obtained at all, and the period of time US Ecology may
be subject to the Merger Agreement without assurance that the merger will be completed;
The fact that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, US Ecology
may be required to pay Republic Services a termination fee in the amount of $46,253,000 and that this
termination fee may discourage other parties that may otherwise have an interest in a business
combination with, or an acquisition of US Ecology;
The fact that upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Republic Services will not be obligated to
pay any “reverse termination fee” to US Ecology.
The significant costs involved in connection with completing the merger, the substantial management
time and effort required to complete the merger, and the related potential disruption to US Ecology’s
operations;
The amount of time it could take from the date of the Board’s deliberations and the Special Meeting to
consummate the transactions, including the fact that an extended period of time may exacerbate the
impact of other risks considered by the Board described herein;
The restrictions on US Ecology’s conduct of business prior to the consummation of the merger
contained in the Merger Agreement (as further described in the “Conduct of Business Pending the
Merger” section of this Proxy Statement), which could delay or prevent US Ecology from undertaking
41

business opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations during the
pendency of the merger without Republic Services’ consent, and the impact of such delay or loss of
business opportunities on US Ecology’s business in the event that the merger is not consummated.
The limitations imposed on the solicitation or consideration by US Ecology of alternative
transactions prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of the merger and the other terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, subject to the Board’s “fiduciary out” exception (as more fully
described in the “Board Recommendation; Change of Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception” section of
this Proxy Statement);
That the Board is required to submit the merger to the vote of US Ecology stockholders at the Special
Meeting even if the Board has made a change of recommendation, unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated;
The interests that certain US Ecology executive officers and directors may have with respect to the
merger in addition to their interests as US Ecology stockholders as described in the “Interests of US
Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” section of this Proxy Statement; and
That the gain likely to be realized by US Ecology stockholders as a result of the merger generally will
be taxable to such stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes if they are not otherwise exempt
from the payment of such taxes (as more fully described in the “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” section of this Proxy Statement).
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be
exhaustive, but rather includes the principal material information, factors and analyses considered by the
Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation in relation to the Merger Agreement and the
transactions. The Board evaluated the various factors listed above in light of its knowledge of the business,
financial condition and prospects of US Ecology, in consultation with US Ecology’s senior management and
outside legal and financial advisors. The Board did not provide a specific assessment of, quantify or
otherwise assign any relative weights to, the factors considered in determining its recommendation. Instead,
the Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors and reasons described above and determined in its
business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the merger to the stockholders of US
Ecology outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences. Individual members of the Board may
have given different weight to different factors. In addition, in arriving at its recommendation, the directors
of US Ecology were aware of the interests of certain officers and directors of US Ecology as described in the
“Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” section of this Proxy Statement.
Opinions of Financial Advisors
Barclays and Houlihan Lokey were retained as co-financial advisors to the Company in connection with a
potential strategic transaction involving the Company. As part of that engagement, the Board requested that
each of the Co-Financial Advisors render an opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to US Ecology stockholders of the merger consideration to be offered to or received by (as applicable)
such stockholders in the merger. On February 8, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the
proposed merger, Barclays rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the various procedures, assumptions and matters considered and the qualifications and limitations
described in such opinion, the merger consideration to be offered to the US Ecology stockholders (other
than the holders of Excluded Shares) in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
stockholders. At the same meeting of the Board, Houlihan Lokey rendered its opinion to the Board to the
effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair to such holders from a financial point of view.
The full text of Barclays’ and Houlihan Lokey’s opinions describe the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by each respective Co-Financial Advisor.
Barclays’ opinion is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated by reference herein, and

such) in connection with, and for the purpose of, its evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration to be offered to the holders of US Ecology common stock (other than the holders of Excluded
Shares) in the merger, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related transaction. Houlihan
Lokey’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for the
purpose of, its evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by
the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and does not address any
other aspect of the merger or any related transaction. The opinion of each Co-Financial Advisor does not address the
relative merits of the merger or any related transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions that
might be available to US Ecology or US Ecology’s underlying business decision to effect the merger or any related
transaction. The opinion of each Co-Financial Advisor does not constitute a recommendation to any US Ecology
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any related transaction. The
following summary of each Co-Financial Advisor’s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
each Co-Financial Advisor’s opinion.
The merger consideration was determined through arms’-length negotiations between US Ecology and
Republic Services and their respective representatives and the decision by the Board to recommend that US
Ecology enter into the merger was solely that of the Board, and the decision by US Ecology to enter into the
merger was solely that of the Board. Each Co-Financial Advisor’s opinion and financial analyses were only
one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Board or the management of US Ecology with respect to the merger or the
merger consideration to be offered to or received by (as applicable) US Ecology stockholders in the merger.
The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by each Co-Financial Advisor
and reviewed with the Board on February 8, 2022 in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order for each Co-Financial Advisor’s financial
analyses to be fully understood, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of each Co-Financial Advisor’s financial analyses.
Opinion and Financial Analyses of Barclays
The Company engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives
for the Company, including a possible sale of the Company, pursuant to an engagement letter dated January
14, 2021. On February 8, 2022, Barclays rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the consideration
to be offered to the stockholders (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) is fair, from a financial
point of view, to such stockholders.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion, dated as of February 8, 2022, is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement.
Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors
considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to
read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion and the methodology that
Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion.
Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Valuation and Fairness Opinion
Committee, is addressed to the Board, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be offered to the stockholders (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the
proposed transaction or any other matter. The terms of the proposed transaction were determined through
arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Republic Services and were unanimously approved by
the Board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to the Company or that any
specific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed transaction.
Barclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the
43

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed transaction, the likelihood
of the consummation of the proposed transaction, or the relative merits of the proposed transaction as
compared to any other transaction in which the Company may engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no
opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the proposed transaction, or any class
of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the stockholders in the proposed transaction.
In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness
of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any holder of warrants issued by the Company, or any
class of such persons, or the treatment of any such warrants in or adjustments to their terms and conditions
resulting from the proposed transaction, relative to the treatment of the Company’s common stock, the
consideration to be offered to the stockholders in the proposed transaction or otherwise. No limitations were
imposed by the Board upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in
rendering its opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:
reviewed and analyzed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated as of February 8, 2022, and the specific
terms of the proposed transaction;
reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning the Company that Barclays believed
to be relevant to its analysis, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31,
June 30 and September 30, 2021;
reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of the Company furnished to Barclays by the Company, including financial projections
prepared by the Company’s management, referred to as the “Projections”  (as defined below) (for
further information regarding the Projections, please see the section of this Proxy Statement entitled
“Projected Financial Information” beginning on page 58);
reviewed and analyzed a trading history of the Company’s common stock over a certain period and a
comparison of such trading history with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition
of the Company and certain multiples of financial metrics based on the financial metrics of the
Company with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
reviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the
future financial performance and price targets of the Company;
reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the financial terms of the proposed transaction with the
financial terms of certain other transactions that Barclays deemed relevant;
had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets,
liabilities, financial condition and prospects; and
had undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial
and other information used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and had
not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information). Barclays also
relied upon the assurances of management of the Company that they were not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections,
upon advice of the Company, Barclays assumed that such Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the
Company’s future financial performance and that the Company would perform substantially in accordance
with such Projections. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed no responsibility for and expressed no
view as to any such Projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its
opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and
did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. In addition,
Barclays was not authorized by the Company to solicit, and did not solicit, any
44 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
indications of interest from any third party with respect to the purchase of all or a part of the Company’s
business. Barclays’ opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they
existed on, and could be evaluated as of, February 8, 2022. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating
or revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that may have occurred after, February 8, 2022.
Barclays assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would conform in all material respects to the last
draft reviewed by Barclays. Additionally, Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and
warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and all the agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed,
upon the advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals,
consents and releases for the proposed would be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and that the proposed transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement thereof. Barclays did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might
result from the proposed transaction, nor did Barclays’ opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or
accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood the Company had obtained such advice as it deemed
necessary from qualified professionals.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other
analyses as summarized below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values
to the Company’s common stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the stockholders (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) of the consideration to be offered
to such stockholders in the proposed transaction on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary
description.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor
considered by it but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the
circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all
analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its
opinion.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the
Board. The summary of Barclays’ analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of the
analyses and reviews underlying Barclays’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and
review and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and, therefore, is not readily
susceptible to summary description.
For the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which
are beyond the control of the Company or any other parties to the proposed transaction. No company,
business or transaction considered in Barclays’ analyses and reviews is identical to the Company, Republic
Services, Merger Sub or the proposed transaction, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and
reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in
Barclays’ analyses and reviews. None of the Company, Republic Services, Merger Sub, Barclays or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates
contained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the
companies,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived
from, Barclays’ analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below include information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables
must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without
considering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Barclays’ analyses and
reviews.
Selected Comparable Company Analysis
In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a
range of relative implied equity values per share of Company common stock by reference to those
companies, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial and operating data relating to the Company
with selected companies that Barclays, based on its experience in the waste treatment and disposal industry,
deemed comparable to the Company. The selected comparable companies with respect to the Company were:
Specialty Waste Companies
Stericycle, Inc.
Clean Harbors, Inc.
Harsco Corporation
Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc.
Solid Waste Companies
Casella Waste Systems, Inc.
Waste Connections, Inc.
Waste Management, Inc.
GFL Environmental Inc.
Republic Services
Exploration & Production Companies:
Secure Energy Services Inc.
Barclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of the Company and the selected
comparable companies. As part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and
analyzed each company’s ratio of enterprise value to estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, or EBITDA, for the calendar year 2022 (which were calendarized as appropriate and
adjusted as appropriate for certain accounting-related matters). The enterprise value of each company was
obtained by adding its short and long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its common equity, the
value of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any minority interest, and
subtracting its cash and cash equivalents. All of these calculations were performed, and based on publicly
available financial data (including FactSet) and closing prices, as of February 4, 2022. The results of this
selected comparable company analysis are summarized below:
Enterprise Value as a Multiple of Calendar Year 2022 Estimated EBITDA

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, this selected comparable company analysis resulted in a 7.2x multiple for Secure Energy Services
Inc.’s ratio of enterprise value to estimated EBITDA for the calendar year 2022 (adjusted as appropriate for
certain accounting-related matters).
Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more business or
operating characteristics with the Company. However, because no selected comparable company is exactly
the same as the Company, Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on
the quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made
qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics
and prospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading
values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and
degree of operational risk between the Company and the companies included in the selected company
analysis. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of 8.5x to 10.5x the Company’s fiscal year
ending December 31, 2022 estimated EBITDA excluding non-recurring and non-cash items and expenses as
applicable, or Adjusted EBITDA, based on the management projections. Barclays then calculated a range of
implied prices per share of Company common stock by (i) subtracting estimated net debt as of December 31,
2021 from the estimated enterprise value (ii) adding to such amount estimated future investments of
approximately $12 million by the Company in a privately-held company and (iii) dividing such amount by the
fully diluted number of shares of Company common stock based on information provided by the
management of the Company. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the
nearest $0.50):
Low
High
Implied Price per Share of Company Common Stock
$27.00
$38.50
Barclays noted that on the basis of the selected comparable company analysis, the transaction consideration
of $48.00 per share of Company common stock was above the range of implied values per share of Company
common stock calculated.
Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis
Barclays reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples paid in selected other
transactions that Barclays, based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed
relevant. Barclays chose such transactions based on, among other things, the similarity of the applicable
target companies in the transactions to the Company with respect to the size, mix, margins and other
characteristics of their businesses. Using publicly available information, Barclays analyzed the ratio of the
applicable target companies’ enterprise values to their last 12 months, or LTM, EBITDA, which is referred to
below as EV/LTM EBITDA.
The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed
were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and
prospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected precedent transaction analysis.
Accordingly, Barclays believed that a purely quantitative selected precedent transaction analysis would not
be particularly meaningful in the context of considering the proposed transaction. Barclays therefore made
qualitative judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of the selected precedent
transactions and the proposed transaction which would affect the acquisition values of the selected target
companies and the Company. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of 9.5x to 11.5x and
applied such range to the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA based on the
management projections. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Company common
stock by (i) subtracting estimated net debt as of December 31, 2021 from the estimated enterprise value (ii)
adding to such amount estimated future investments of approximately $12 million by the Company in a
privately-held company and (iii) dividing such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Company
common stock based on information provided by the management of the Company. The following table sets
forth the transactions analyzed based on such characteristics and the results of such analysis (rounded to
the nearest $0.50):

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
In order to estimate the present value of the Company’s common stock, Barclays performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of the Company. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology
used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of
the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by
discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic
assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate
factors.
Barclays first calculated the estimated enterprise value of the Company using the discounted cash flow
method, Barclays added (i) the Company’s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2022
through 2026, based on management projections, to (ii) the “terminal value” of the Company and (iii) any tax
savings from the use of net operating losses, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range
of selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the Adjusted
EBITDA of the Company and (i) subtracting cash expenses, cash taxes and capital expenditures and (ii)
adjusting for changes in working capital, in each case based on the management projections. The residual
value of the Company at the end of the forecast period, or “terminal value,” was estimated by selecting a
range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which were derived by Barclays utilizing its professional
judgment and experience. The range of after-tax discount rates of 8.5% to 9.5% was selected based on an
analysis of the unlevered beta of the Company and the capital structures of the selected comparable
companies.
Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Company common stock by (i) subtracting
estimated net debt as of December 31, 2021 from the estimated enterprise value using the
48 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
discounted cash flow method (ii) adding to such amount estimated future investments of approximately $12
million by the Company in a privately-held company and (iii) dividing such amount by the fully diluted
number of shares of Company common stock based on information provided by the management of the
Company. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the nearest $0.50):

Share of 
Company Common

Discount Rates of 8.5% - 9.5%
2.0% - 3.0%

Barclays noted that on the basis of the discounted cash flow analysis, the transaction consideration of
$48.00 per share of Company common stock was within the range of implied values per share of Company
common stock calculated using management projections.
Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Barclays performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per
share of Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a
theoretical future value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial projections and
valuation multiples.
Barclays first calculated the implied future enterprise values of the Company for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years by applying ratios of the Company’s enterprise value
to Adjusted EBITDA for the next twelve months, or NTM, period (“EV to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples”)
ranging from 8.5x to 10.5x to NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimates for the Company as reflected in the
management projections for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
The illustrative EV to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates were derived by Barclays utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical trading data, and was based
upon the midpoint trading multiple of comparable companies.
Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Company common stock by (i) subtracting the
projected amount of the Company’s net debt as of each respective fiscal year end based on management
projections, (ii) adding to such amount estimated future investments of approximately $12 million by the
Company in a privately-held company, (iii) dividing such amount by the estimated fully diluted number of
shares of Company common stock derived from management projections and (iv) adding to such future
equity values per share of Company common stock the anticipated amount of annual dividends per share of
Company common stock, as applicable, based on the management projections.
Utilizing a discount rate of 9.9%, reflecting an estimate of the cost of equity for the Company and derived by
application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires taking into account the selected comparable
companies’ capital structure, the Company’s unlevered beta, market risk premium, yields for U.S. Treasury
notes, tax rates and other appropriate factors, Barclays then derived a range of implied present values per
share of Company common stock for the Company by discounting to present value, the implied future values
per share of Company common stock as a stand-alone entity as of December 31, 2021. The following table
presents the results of the analysis of the implied present value of the illustrative future value per share of

Historical Share Price Analysis
To illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of the Company’s common stock, Barclays considered
historical data with regard to the trading prices of the Company’s common stock for the period from January
1, 2021 to February 4, 2022. Barclays noted that during the period from January 1, 2021 to February 4, 2022,
the closing price of the Company’s common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.50) ranged from $27.00 to
$45.00. The Historical Share Price Analysis was used for informational purposes only and was not included
in Barclays’ financial analyses.
Analyst Price Targets Analysis
Barclays reviewed and compared publicly available research analysts’ per share price targets as of February
4, 2022 for the Company’s common stock. The research analysts’ per share price targets for the Company’s
common stock ranged from $36.00 to $45.00. The publicly available per share price targets published by
securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect the current market trading prices for the Company’s
common stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including future financial performance of the
Company and future market conditions. Barclays noted that the transaction consideration of $48.00 was
above the range of analyst price targets for the Company’s common stock. Research analyst price targets for
the Company were used for informational purposes only and were not included in Barclays’ financial
analyses.
General
Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking
activities, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. The Board selected Barclays because of its familiarity with the Company and
its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the
proposed transaction.
Barclays is acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the proposed transaction. As
compensation for its services in connection with the proposed transaction, the Company paid Barclays $1.5
million upon the delivery of Barclays’ opinion, which is referred to as the “Opinion Fee”. The Opinion Fee
was not contingent upon the conclusion of Barclays’ opinion or the consummation of the proposed
transaction. Additional compensation of approximately $16 million to $17 million will be payable on
completion of the proposed transaction against which the amounts paid for the opinion will be credited. In
addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion of its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, up to an aggregate amount of $75,000
(excluding reimbursable legal fees), and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its
engagement by the Company and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion. Barclays has performed various
investment banking services for the Company and Republic Services in the past, and expects to perform
such services in the future, and has received, and expects to receive, customary fees for such services.
During the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Barclays has provided various investment banking
services to Republic Services for which Barclays has received compensation in an amount of less than $2
million. Specifically, in the past two years, Barclays has performed the following investment banking and
financial services: (i) Barclays is currently acting as a lender and co-documentation agent under Republic
Services’ revolving credit facility; (ii) Barclays acted as an underwriter and joint book running manager in
connection with Republic Services’ $400.0 million notes offering in February 2020; (iii) Barclays acted as an
underwriter and joint book running manager in connection with Republic Services’ $600.0 million notes
offering in February 2020; (iv) Barclays acted as an underwriter and joint book running manager in

underwriter and co-manager in connection with Republic Services’ $750.0 million notes offering in November
2020; (vi) Barclays acted as an underwriter, joint book running manager and billing and delivery agent in
connection with Republic Services’ $350.0 million notes offering in November 2020; and (vii) Barclays acted

Opinion and Financial Analyses of Houlihan Lokey
On February 8, 2022, Houlihan Lokey rendered its opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the
holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such
holders from a financial point of view.
Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was directed to the Board (in its capacity as such) and only addressed the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of US Ecology common stock in the
merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and did not address any other aspect or implication of the merger or any
other agreement, arrangement or understanding. The summary of Houlihan Lokey’s opinion in this Proxy Statement
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this Proxy
Statement and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken and other matters considered by Houlihan Lokey in connection with the preparation of its opinion.
However, neither Houlihan Lokey’s opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this
Proxy Statement are intended to be, and do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to the Board, any security
holder of the Company or any other person as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the merger.
In arriving at its opinion, Houlihan Lokey, among other things:
reviewed a draft dated February 8, 2022 of the Merger Agreement;
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant, including certain publicly available research analyst estimates
with respect to the future financial performance of the Company;

condition and prospects of the Company made available to Houlihan Lokey by the Company,
including the Projections (as defined below).

advisors regarding the business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company, the
merger and related matters;
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with that of public companies that
Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant;
considered publicly available financial terms of certain transactions that Houlihan Lokey deemed to
be relevant;

publicly traded securities, and the current and historical market prices of the publicly traded
securities of certain other companies that Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant; and
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information
and factors as Houlihan Lokey deemed appropriate.
Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness
of all data, material and other information furnished, or otherwise made available, to

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Houlihan Lokey, discussed with or reviewed by Houlihan Lokey, or publicly available, and did not assume
any responsibility with respect to such data, material and other information. In addition, management of the
Company advised Houlihan Lokey, and Houlihan Lokey assumed, that the financial projections (and
adjustments thereto) reviewed by Houlihan Lokey were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to the future financial
results and condition of the Company and the other matters covered thereby, and Houlihan Lokey expressed
no opinion with respect to such projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Houlihan Lokey
relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there was no change in the business,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the Company since
the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise,
provided to Houlihan Lokey that would be material to Houlihan Lokey’s analyses or its opinion, and that
there was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Houlihan Lokey
incomplete or misleading.
Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and
warranties of all parties to the Merger Agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are
referred to therein were true and correct, (b) each party to the Merger Agreement and other related
documents and instruments would fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to
be performed by such party, (c) all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without
waiver thereof, and (d) the merger would be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms
described in the Merger Agreement and other related documents and instruments, without any amendments
or modifications thereto. Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i)
the merger would be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable federal and
state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions
or conditions would be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an effect on
the merger or the Company that would be material to Houlihan Lokey’s analyses or its opinion. Houlihan
Lokey also relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, at the direction of the Company, that
any adjustments to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement would not be material to Houlihan
Lokey’s analyses or its opinion. In addition, Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent
verification, that the final form of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect from the draft of the
Merger Agreement identified above.
Furthermore, in connection with Houlihan Lokey’s opinion, Houlihan Lokey was not requested to make, and
did not make, any physical inspection or independent appraisal or evaluation of any of the assets, properties
or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company or any other party,
nor was Houlihan Lokey provided with any such appraisal or evaluation. Houlihan Lokey did not estimate,
and expressed no opinion regarding, the liquidation value of any entity or business. Houlihan Lokey did not
undertake any independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible
unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which the Company was or may be a party or was or may
be subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other contingent
liabilities to which the Company was or may be a party or was or may be subject.
Houlihan Lokey was not requested to, and did not, initiate any discussions or negotiations with, or solicit
any indications of interest from, third parties with respect to the securities, assets, business or operations of
the Company or any other party, or any alternatives to the merger. Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was necessarily
based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to Houlihan Lokey as of, the date thereof. Houlihan Lokey did not undertake, and is under no obligation, to
update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or
coming to Houlihan Lokey’s attention after the date thereof.
Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was furnished for the use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with
its evaluation of the merger and may not be used for any other purpose without Houlihan Lokey’s prior
written consent. Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was not intended to be, and did not constitute, a recommendation
to the Board, any security holder or any other party as to how to act or vote or make any election with
respect to any matter relating to the merger or otherwise.
52 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Houlihan Lokey was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or
otherwise address, among other things: (i) the underlying business decision of the Board, the Company, its
security holders or any other party to proceed with or effect the merger, (ii) the terms of any arrangements,
understandings, agreements or documents related to, or the form, structure or any other portion or aspect of,
the merger or otherwise (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified therein), (iii)
the fairness of any portion or aspect of the merger to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, or to any other party, except if and only to the extent expressly set forth in
the last sentence of Houlihan Lokey’s opinion, (iv) the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available for the Company or any other party,
(v) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the merger to any one class or group of the Company’s or any
other party’s security holders or other constituents vis-à-vis any other class or group of the Company’s or
such other party’s security holders or other constituents (including, without limitation, the fairness of the
amount or the nature of any compensation to any holder of warrants issued by the Company, or any class of
such persons, or the treatment of any such warrants in or adjustments to their terms and conditions resulting
from the merger, relative to the treatment of US Ecology’s common stock or the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of US Ecology’s common stock in the merger, or the allocation of any consideration
amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents), (vi) whether or not the
Company, its security holders or any other party is receiving or paying reasonably equivalent value in the
merger, (vii) the solvency, creditworthiness or fair value of the Company or any other participant in the
merger, or any of their respective assets, under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance or similar matters, or (viii) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount, nature
or any other aspect of any compensation to or consideration payable to or received by any officers, directors
or employees of any party to the merger, any class of such persons or any other party, relative to the
consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation was intended in matters that
require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. It was assumed that
such opinions, counsel or interpretations were or will be obtained from the appropriate professional sources.
Furthermore, Houlihan Lokey relied, with the consent of the Board, on the assessments by the Board, the
Company, and its advisors, as to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax and other similar matters
with respect to the Company and the merger or otherwise.
In performing its analyses, Houlihan Lokey considered general business, economic, industry and market
conditions, financial and otherwise, and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the
date of its opinion. No company, transaction or business used in Houlihan Lokey’s analyses for comparative
purposes is identical to the Company or the proposed merger and an evaluation of the results of those
analyses is not entirely mathematical. As a consequence, mathematical derivations (such as the high, low,
mean and median) of financial data are not by themselves meaningful and in selecting the ranges of multiples
to be applied were considered in conjunction with experience and the exercise of judgment. The estimates
contained in the financial forecasts prepared by the management of the Company and the implied reference
range values indicated by Houlihan Lokey’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or securities
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold,
which may depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Much of
the information used in, and accordingly the results of, Houlihan Lokey’s analyses are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty.
Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Board in evaluating the proposed
merger. Neither Houlihan Lokey’s opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the consideration or of the
views of the Board or management with respect to the merger or the consideration. Under the terms of its
engagement by the Company, neither Houlihan Lokey’s opinion nor any other advice or services rendered
by it in connection with the proposed merger or otherwise, should be construed as creating, and Houlihan
Lokey should not be deemed to have, any fiduciary duty to, or agency relationships with, the Board, the
Company, Republic Services, any security holder or creditor of the Company or Republic Services or any
other person, regardless of any prior or ongoing advice or relationships. The type and amount of
consideration payable in the merger were determined through arms’-length negotiation between the
Company and Republic Services, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the
Board.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financial Analyses
In preparing its opinion to the Board, Houlihan Lokey performed a variety of analyses, including those
described below. The summary of Houlihan Lokey’s analyses is not a complete description of the analyses
underlying Houlihan Lokey’s opinion. The preparation of such an opinion is a complex process involving
various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to the financial, comparative
and other analytical methods employed and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique
facts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Houlihan Lokey’s opinion nor its underlying
analyses is readily susceptible to summary description. Houlihan Lokey arrived at its opinion based on the
results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions
from or with regard to any individual analysis, methodology or factor. While the results of each analysis
were taken into account in reaching Houlihan Lokey’s overall conclusion with respect to fairness, Houlihan
Lokey did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. Accordingly, Houlihan
Lokey believes that its analyses and the following summary must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all analyses,
methodologies and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying
Houlihan Lokey’s analyses and opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Houlihan Lokey in connection
with the preparation of its opinion and reviewed with the Board on February 8, 2022. The order of the
analyses does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Houlihan Lokey. The
analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without
considering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of Houlihan Lokey’s analyses.
For purposes of its analyses, Houlihan Lokey reviewed a number of financial and operating metrics,
including:
Adjusted EBITDA -
generally, the amount of the relevant company’s EBITDA for a specified time period, adjusted
for certain non-recurring items.
in the case of the Company, for purposes of the analyses summarized below Adjusted EBITDA
treats stock-based compensation as a cash expense, and forecasted Adjusted EBITDA
includes EBITDA contributions from the Company’s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be
started in fiscal year 2022 and excludes EBITDA contributions from the Company’s ROI
Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024 (for further
information, please refer to “Adjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI)” in the section of this
Proxy Statement entitled “Projected Financial Information” beginning on page 58).
EBITDA - generally, the amount of the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization for a specified time period.
Enterprise Value - generally, the value as of a specified date of the relevant company’s outstanding
equity securities (taking into account outstanding options and other securities convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable into or for equity securities of the company) plus the amount of its net
debt (the amount of its outstanding indebtedness, non-convertible preferred stock, capital lease
obligations and non-controlling interests less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance
sheet).
Return-on-investment initiatives (“ROI Initiatives”) - represents certain specific growth-oriented or
cost mitigating capital expenditures of the Company that are justified based on their return on
investment.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, enterprise values and equity values used in the selected companies
analysis described below were calculated using the closing price of US Ecology’s common stock and the
common stock of the selected companies listed below as of February 4, 2022, and transaction values for the
54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
selected transactions analysis described below were calculated on an enterprise value basis based on the
announced transaction equity price and other public information available at the time of the announcement.
The estimates of the future financial and operating performance of the Company relied upon for the financial
analyses described below were based on the Projections. The estimates of the future financial and operating
performance of the selected companies listed below were based on certain publicly available research analyst
estimates for those companies.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the
Company, based on the Projections, separately calculating (i) the estimated net present value of the
projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows of the Company on an enterprise basis and the estimated net
present value of the terminal value of the Company (in each case, including the Company’s ROI Initiatives
that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2022 and excluding net cash flows from the Company’s ROI
Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024), and (ii) the estimated net
present value of the projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows of the Company’s ROI Initiatives that are
forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024 and the estimated net present value of the
terminal value of such ROI Initiatives.
Enterprise.  Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company on an enterprise
basis by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows of
the Company and the estimated net present value of the terminal value of the Company, based on the
Projections, in each case, including the Company’s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal
year 2022 and excluding net cash flows from the Company’s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started
in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024; for further information, please refer to “Unlevered Free Cash Flow
(Enterprise)” in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled “Projected Financial Information” beginning on
page 58. Houlihan Lokey calculated terminal values for the Company by applying a range of perpetuity
growth rates of 2.5% to 3.0% to the Company’s fiscal year 2026 estimated unlevered, after-tax free cash
flows. The net present values of the Company’s projected future cash flows and terminal values were then
calculated using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5%, based on an estimate of the Company’s weighted
average cost of capital, to determine an implied enterprise value reference range.
ROI Initiatives.  Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company’s ROI
Initiatives by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
of the Company’s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024 and
the estimated net present value of the terminal value of such ROI Initiatives, based on the Projections (the
“ROI Initiatives Implied Value”); for further information, please refer to “Unlevered Free Cash Flow (ROI)”
in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled “Projected Financial Information” beginning on page 58.
Houlihan Lokey calculated terminal values for such ROI Initiatives by applying a range of perpetuity growth
rates of 2.5% to 3.0% to such ROI Initiatives’ fiscal year 2026 normalized unlevered, after-tax free cash flows.
The net present values of such ROI Initiatives’ projected future cash flows and terminal values were then
calculated using discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 12.0%, based on an estimate of the cost of equity of (i)
the Company and (ii) the selected companies listed below, to determine an implied value.
Houlihan Lokey then added the implied enterprise value reference range from the discounted cash flow
analysis of the Company on an enterprise basis and the ROI Initiatives Implied Value, to determine a total
implied enterprise value reference range for the Company. Houlihan Lokey then subtracted total debt and
added cash and cash equivalents, the book value of the Company’s long-term investments, as provided by
Company management and each as of December 31, 2021, and the present value of the expected tax savings
from the Company’s net operating losses, as provided by Company management (calculated assuming a
federal tax rate of 21.0% and using a discount rate range of 11.0% to 12.0%, based on an estimate of the
Company’s cost of equity), to derive an implied equity value reference range for the Company. The figures in
the implied equity value reference range were then divided by the number of fully diluted shares of US
Ecology common stock outstanding to calculate a reference range of implied equity values per share. The
discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range of $43.64 - $60.63,
as compared to the proposed merger consideration of $48.00 per share in cash.
Selected Companies Analysis.  Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain data for selected companies with publicly
traded equity securities that, based on its professional judgment and experience, Houlihan Lokey deemed
relevant with respect to its analysis of the Company.

Taking into account the results of the selected transactions analysis, Houlihan Lokey applied the selected
multiple range set forth in the table below to the Company’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2021,
to calculate an implied enterprise value reference range. Houlihan Lokey then subtracted total debt and
added cash and cash equivalents, the book value of the Company’s long-term investments, as provided by
Company management, with balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021, and the ROI Initiatives
Implied Value, to derive an implied equity value reference range. The figures in the implied equity value
reference range were then divided by the number of fully diluted shares of US Ecology common stock

Projected Financial Information
US Ecology has not historically publicly disclosed long-term projections as to future financial performance
due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates, though US
Ecology has in the past provided investors with full-fiscal year financial guidance on certain financial
metrics, including total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, which are updated when
necessary during the relevant fiscal year, and five year growth targets for certain financial measures.
However, in connection with the evaluation of the proposed merger, US Ecology’s senior management
shared certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by it for strategic planning
purposes with the Board, Republic Services and the Co-Financial Advisors, for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2022 and the four following fiscal years ending 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively (which
we refer to as the “Projections”).
The Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this Proxy Statement
only because such information was made available to the Board, Republic Services and the Co-Financial
Advisors as described above. The Projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”), the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information. The prospective financial information included in this Proxy Statement has been
prepared by, and is the responsibility of, US Ecology’s senior management, and is subjective in many
respects. The Projections were, in the view of US Ecology’s senior management, prepared on a reasonable
basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the
time of preparation, to the best of senior management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action
and the expected future financial performance of US Ecology on a standalone basis, subject to the
assumptions and limitations described in this section. Furthermore, neither US Ecology’s independent
auditors nor any other independent accountants have audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied
58 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and,
accordingly, assume no responsibility for, and express no opinion or other form of assurance on, such
information or its achievability.
The Projections are forward-looking statements. Except as specifically noted in this “Projected Financial
Information” section of this Proxy Statement, although summaries of the Projections are presented with
numerical specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made
by US Ecology’s senior management, which it believes were reasonable at the time the Projections were
prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at such time. However, this
information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily predictive of actual future results.
Important factors may affect actual results and cause the forecasts not to be achieved. These factors include
general economic conditions, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, timing of business investments
by US Ecology, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, changes in tax or other
laws or regulations, and the other factors described in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this Proxy
Statement, the “Risk Factors” section in US Ecology’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021 and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the information referenced in
the “Additional Information and Where to Find It” section of this Proxy Statement.
Generally, the further out the period to which the Projections relate, the less predictable and more unreliable
the information becomes. In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date that the Projections were prepared. Furthermore, the Projections were prepared on a
standalone basis without giving effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the
Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger,
including the expenses payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the potential synergies that may be
achieved as a result of the merger, or the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been
or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the
Projections. The inclusion of this information in the Proxy Statement should not be regarded as an indication
that US Ecology’s senior management, the Board, the Co-Financial Advisors, Republic Services or any other
recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Projections to be material information of US
Ecology, or necessarily predictive of actual future results, nor should it be construed as financial guidance,
and it should not be relied upon as such. The summary of the Projections is not included in this Proxy
Statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the
non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation or the adjournment proposal or to influence
any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to
seek appraisal rights with respect to the shares of US Ecology common stock.
The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and
other information regarding US Ecology contained in US Ecology’s public filings with the SEC. The
Projections were prepared by US Ecology’s senior management with, and considered and approved by, the
Board in connection with its evaluation and approval of the merger and were relied upon by the Co-Financial
Advisors for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions, as described more fully in the
“Reasons for Recommendation” and “Opinions of Financial Advisors” sections of this Proxy Statement.
Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim
any responsibility to update or otherwise revise the forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date
when we prepared the Projections or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general
economic or industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Projections
are shown to be in error. We can give no assurance that, had our Projections been prepared either as of the
date of the Merger Agreement or as of the date of this Proxy Statement, similar estimates and assumptions
would be used. Neither US Ecology nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, advisors or other
representatives has made or makes any representation to any of our stockholders or any other person
regarding the ultimate performance of US Ecology compared to the information contained in our Projections
or that our Projections will be achieved.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections and considering that the
Special Meeting will be held several months after the Projections were prepared, stockholders are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on the Projections included in this Proxy Statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain of the measures included in the Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as
noted below. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and management in understanding
current profitability levels and liquidity that may serve as a basis for evaluating future performance and
facilitating comparability of results. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation
from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP
financial measures as used by US Ecology may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other
companies. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the forecasts were relied upon by the Co-Financial
Advisors for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions and by the Board in connection
with its consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the
definition of non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures
of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure.
Summary of the Projections
Except as specifically noted in this “Projected Financial Information” section of this Proxy Statement, the
following is a summary of the Projections prepared by senior management of US Ecology and provided to its
Board, the Co-Financial Advisors and Republic Services prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement

EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, means net (loss) income from continuing operations adjusted
for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure,
means EBITDA adjusted to exclude non-cash and non-recurring items, as well as other adjustments
permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the agreements governing US Ecology’s
outstanding debt securities and credit facilities. US Ecology excludes acquisition and development
costs and stock-based compensation in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. US Ecology believes
Adjusted EBITDA is useful to evaluate performance because it eliminates the effects of financing and
income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as certain items that are not
indicative of US Ecology’s performance on an ongoing basis.
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI), a non-GAAP financial measure, means Adjusted EBITDA
less stock-based compensation expense and the EBITDA contribution from ROI Initiatives that are
forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024. The measure of Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding SBC and ROI) was calculated by Houlihan Lokey based on information provided by US
Ecology’s senior management as set forth in the Projections, and was reviewed and approved by US
Ecology’s senior management for Houlihan Lokey’s use in connection with its financial analyses
described in the section entitled “Opinions of Financial Advisors - Opinion and Financial Analyses of
Houlihan Lokey” beginning on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.
Unlevered Cash Flows is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by Barclays as Adjusted EBITDA
less expenses, cash taxes and capital expenditures and adjusted for changes in working capital, in each
case, as set forth in the Projections. The measure of Unlevered Cash Flows was reviewed and approved
by US Ecology’s senior management for Barclays’ use in connection with its illustrative discounted
cash flows analyses described in the section entitled “Opinions of Financial Advisors - Opinion and
Financial Analyses of Barclays” beginning on page 43 of this Proxy Statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Unlevered Free Cash Flows (Enterprise) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by Houlihan Lokey
as Adjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI), less business development expense, less depreciation,
amortization and accretion expense, less taxes, plus depreciation, amortization and accretion expense,
less closing and post-closing payments, less capital expenditures and adjusted for changes in working
capital, in each case based on information provided by US Ecology senior management as set forth in
the Projections, and was reviewed and approved by US Ecology senior management for Houlihan
Lokey’s use in connection with its financial analyses described in the section entitled “Opinions of
Financial Advisors - Opinion and Financial Analyses of Houlihan Lokey” beginning on page 51 of this Proxy
Statement.
Unlevered Free Cash Flows (ROI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by Houlihan Lokey as the
tax-effected EBITDA contribution from ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year
2023 or fiscal year 2024, plus depreciation expense, less capital expenditures, in each case based on
information provided by US Ecology’s senior management as set forth in the Projections, and was
reviewed and approved by US Ecology’s senior management for Houlihan Lokey’s use in connection
with its financial analyses described in the section entitled “Opinions of Financial Advisors - Opinion and
Financial Analyses of Houlihan Lokey” beginning on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.
CapEx means capital expenditures for maintenance activities including equipment replacement,
infrastructure improvements and other routine capital projects, landfill airspace expansion and growth
capital from ROI Initiatives that are expected to result in increased revenue or reduced expenses.
Treatment of US Ecology Warrants in the Merger
US Ecology warrants are currently registered under the Exchange Act, and are listed on the Nasdaq Capital
Market under the symbol “ECOLW.” At the effective time, in accordance with the terms of each warrant
issued pursuant to that certain Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to the Warrant Agreement between
the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, dated November 1, 2019, Republic Services will
cause the surviving corporation to issue a replacement warrant to each holder thereof that complies with and
satisfies the applicable terms and conditions of the Warrant Agreement, providing that such replacement
warrant shall be exercisable for an amount in cash, without interest, determined in accordance with the
Warrant Agreement. For more information, please see “Questions and Answers - What effects will the merger
have on the US Ecology warrants?”
Following the consummation of the merger, US Ecology warrants will be de-listed from the Nasdaq Capital
Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.
Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation by the Board that US Ecology stockholders vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement, stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of US Ecology have
certain interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of US Ecology
stockholders generally. The members of the Board and US Ecology’s management team were aware of these
interests in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, considering the merger and, in the case of the
Board, in recommending that US Ecology stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests may
present such directors and executive officers with actual or potential conflicts of interest and these interests
are described in this section.
The interests of the persons who are directors or executive officers of US Ecology are discussed below. The
executive officers of US Ecology are also US Ecology’s named executive officers.
Treatment of US Ecology Equity Awards in the Merger
Treatment of Stock Options - At the effective time of the merger, each Company stock option with an exercise
price per share of US Ecology common stock less than $48.00 that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of such
Company stock option to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding or other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the
number
61 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of shares of US Ecology common stock subject to the Company stock option multiplied by (ii) the excess of
$48.00 over the per-share exercise price of such Company stock option. Each Company stock option
outstanding as of the effective time that is not canceled as described in the preceding sentence, whether
vested or unvested (including 206,363 Company stock options held by directors and officers of the Company
with per-share exercise prices of $48.00 or greater), shall, at the effective time, automatically be cancelled
without any consideration paid to the holder thereof.
Treatment of Performance Stock Unit Awards - At the effective time, each performance stock unit award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of
such performance stock unit to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding or other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the
number of shares of US Ecology common stock equal to the greater of (a) the target number of shares of US
Ecology common stock with respect to such performance stock unit as defined and set forth in the applicable
award agreement and (b) the number of shares of US Ecology common stock determined based upon the
actual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior to the effective time, as reasonably
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) $48.00.
Treatment of Restricted Stock Unit Awards - At the effective time, each restricted stock unit award
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of
such restricted stock unit award to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding or other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the
number of shares of US Ecology common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award multiplied by (ii)
$48.00.
Treatment of Restricted Share Awards - At the effective time, each restricted share award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of such restricted
share award to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or
other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the number of shares of
US Ecology common stock subject to such restricted share award multiplied by (ii) $48.00.
Absent the prior written consent of Republic Services, US Ecology is not permitted to grant stock options,
performance stock units, restricted stock units or other equity or equity-based awards prior to closing.
Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the closing has not occurred by March 31, 2023, US Ecology
may grant equity awards in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. However, any such post-
March 31, 2023 awards will not vest upon closing but will be converted into equity awards of equivalent
value of Republic Services.
Treatment of 2022 Annual Bonuses
Under the Merger Agreement, following the closing, to the extent not paid prior to the closing, Republic
Services is required to pay, or cause one of its affiliates to pay, bonuses under the Company’s annual bonus
program for the 2022 performance year, determined and payable based on the greater of (i) actual
performance and (ii) 80% of the target level achievement.
Prospects of Continued Employment
Executive officers of US Ecology, in negotiating the Merger Agreement on behalf of US Ecology, would have
been aware that, if the Merger Agreement were to be adopted by US Ecology’s stockholders and the merger
were to be effected, following the closing, Republic Services would be the ultimate employer of US Ecology’s
current employees and would have discretion to decide whether to continue to retain or to grant any
additional salary or benefits to any particular employee. Republic Services communicated to Jeffrey R. Feeler,
the Company’s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, in the course of the arms’-length
negotiations between US Ecology and Republic Services, that there would likely not be a long-term role for
Mr. Feeler at the surviving company following the closing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Employment Agreements
US Ecology is party to an employment agreement with each of its executive officers, who are also US
Ecology’s named executive officers. Each of these employment agreements provides for severance payable
to the executive officer in connection with a qualifying termination of employment, which is a termination
without “cause” or resignation for “good reason,” as defined in the applicable employment agreement, as
well as in connection with a change in control event and a subsequent qualifying termination of employment
within 24 months after such change in control.
Generally, in the event of a qualifying termination that occurs within 24 months following the closing of the
transaction, each of the executive officers would be entitled under his employment agreement to the
following:
A lump sum payment equal to two times (or three times, in the case of Mr. Feeler) the sum of (i) base
salary; and (ii) the greater of (a) any earned but unpaid amount due under any cash incentive plan
and (b) the executive officer’s target incentive amount under a cash incentive plan;
Reimbursement of medical, dental and vision insurance premiums pursuant to COBRA for a period up
to 18 months;
6 (or 18, in the case of Mr. Feeler) monthly payments, each in an amount equal to the greater of (i)
$5,000 and (ii) two times the monthly COBRA medical, dental and vision insurance premiums as of the
termination date, commencing on the 18-month anniversary of the termination date;
24 (or 36, in the case of Mr. Feeler) monthly cash payments each equal to two times the monthly
premiums as of the termination date under the Company’s life insurance and long-term disability
insurance plans;
In the case of Mr. Feeler only, up to 12 consecutive months of outplacement services not to exceed
$100,000 in the aggregate (such benefits to end no later than the third anniversary of the termination
date);
Full vesting of all unvested stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock
units (but only to the extent granted after the effective date of the employment agreement),
performance stock units (but only to the extent not subject to Code Section 409A or, if subject to
Code Section 409A, only to the extent granted after the effective date of the employment agreement)
and performance stock (with performance with respect to performance-based awards to be deemed
achieved at target); and
Continued vesting of any restricted stock units and performance stock units subject to Code Section
409A, in each case, outstanding on the effective date of the employment agreement, in the same
manner as if no termination of employment occurred (with payment based on target performance).
The employment agreements do not provide for these payments and benefits to the executive officers
immediately upon the closing of the transaction (i.e., on a “single trigger” basis). Instead, the employment
agreements provide for these payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment that
occurs within 24 months following the closing of the transaction. Payment of these amounts is subject to the
execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form provided by the Company and the
executive officer’s compliance with the confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-disparagement restrictive
covenants contained in the employment agreements.
Summary of Potential Transaction Payments to Executive Officers and Directors of US Ecology
The following table indicates the dollar amounts potentially payable to US Ecology’s executive officers, who
are also US Ecology’s named executive officers, and directors under the compensation arrangements
described above upon the effective time of the merger, assuming the effective time of the merger occurs on
June 30, 2022 and a contemporaneous qualifying termination of employment occurs.

termination following the effective time of the merger, continued health, dental, vision and life insurance
benefits and, for Mr. Feeler’s outplacement services.
Not subject to non-binding advisory vote on named executive officer golden parachute compensation.
Insurance and Indemnification of, and Advancement of Expenses to, Directors and Executive Officers
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Other Covenants and Agreements - Directors’ and Officers’
Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy Statement for a summary of the obligations
of the surviving company with respect to insurance indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to,
directors and executive officers after the effective time.
Financing
Republic Services has committed to have, at closing, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate merger
consideration contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to perform the other obligations of Republic
Services and Merger Sub contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Republic Services expects to finance the
merger using existing and new sources of debt. The consummation of the merger is not conditioned upon
Republic Services’ or Merger Sub’s receipt of financing, but US Ecology has agreed to cooperate with
Republic Services in obtaining its financing for the transactions. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Other Covenants and Agreements - Financing Cooperation “ beginning on page 79 of this Proxy
Statement for additional details.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
General - The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
to holders of shares of US Ecology common stock. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code,
administrative interpretations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings as in effect as of the date of this
Proxy Statement, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is for the general
information of the holders of shares of US Ecology common stock only and does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger.
This discussion addresses only the consequences of the exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock
held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). It does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a US
Ecology stockholder in light of the US Ecology stockholder’s particular circumstances, or to a US Ecology
stockholder that is subject to special rules, such as:
A bank, insurance company, or other financial institution;

A trader in securities who elects the mark-to-market method of accounting;
An individual subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code;
A mutual fund;
A U.S. expatriate or former citizen or long-term resident of the United States;
A foreign pension fund and its affiliates;
A person whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
A former citizen or former long-term resident of the United States;
A real estate investment trust or regulated investment company;
A US Ecology stockholder that holds its shares of US Ecology common stock through individual
retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;
A US Ecology stockholder that exercises appraisal rights;
A US Ecology stockholder that holds shares of US Ecology common stock as part of a hedge,
appreciated financial position, straddle, or conversion or integrated transaction;
A US Ecology stockholder that acquired shares of US Ecology common stock through the exercise of
compensatory options or stock purchase plans or otherwise as compensation; or
A US Ecology stockholder that is required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income
with respect to the merger as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial
statement.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of US Ecology common stock
that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
A corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state therein or the District of Columbia;
An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the
substantial decisions of which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of US Ecology common stock that is neither a U.S. holder
nor a partnership (nor an entity treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds shares of US Ecology common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in
the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A
partner in a partnership holding shares of US Ecology common stock should consult its tax advisors.
This discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is not a complete
description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion does not
address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it
does not address any U.S. state or local or any non-U.S. tax consequences of the merger or the potential
application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. Accordingly, each US Ecology
stockholder should consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S.
income or other tax consequences to it of the merger.
This discussion does not address any tax consequences of the merger arising under the laws of any state,
local or foreign jurisdiction or U.S. federal laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws and does not

TABLE OF CONTENTS
address tax considerations applicable to holders who exercise appraisal rights or to persons who hold US
Ecology stock options, performance stock unit awards, restricted share unit awards, warrants or other rights
to acquire an equity interest in the Company.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders - The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S.
holders pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder will recognize taxable capital gain or loss in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) such U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of US Ecology common stock exchanged therefor. A U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in a particular share of US Ecology common stock generally will equal the price the U.S.
holder paid for such share of US Ecology common stock.
If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of US Ecology common stock surrendered in the merger is
greater than one year as of the completion of the merger, the capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain
or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject
to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in connection
with the merger is subject to limitations under the Code. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares
of US Ecology common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of US Ecology common
stock that it holds.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to non-U.S. Holders - The receipt of the merger consideration by a
non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
The gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with a trade or business
of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States);
The non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the merger and certain other conditions are met; or
The non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more
than 5% of US Ecology common stock at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding the
merger, and US Ecology is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the
shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held the
shares of US Ecology common stock.
Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax on a net income basis in the same manner
as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise).
Additionally, any gain described in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also
may be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable
income tax treaty). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to tax at a
rate of 30% (or a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any capital gain realized, which
may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year. If the third bullet point
above applies to a non-U.S. holder, capital gain recognized by such holder will be subject to tax at generally
applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. We believe that we are not, and we do not anticipate becoming, a
“United States real property holding corporation.” However, because the determination of whether we are a
“United States real property holding corporation” depends on the fair market value of our United States real
property interests relative to the fair market value of our global real property interests and other business
assets, there can be no assurance that we do not currently constitute or will not become a “United States
real property holding corporation.” Non-U.S. holders owning (actually or constructively) more than 5% of
US Ecology common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting - Payments of cash made in exchange for shares of US
Ecology common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information
reporting and backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise
establish an exemption should complete and return an IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of
67 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
perjury that such U.S. holder is a “United States person”  (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer
identification number provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. To
avoid backup withholding, a non-U.S. holder is required to establish an exemption, for example, by
completing and providing to the applicable withholding agent the appropriate IRS Form W-8 for the non-U.S.
holder, in accordance with the instructions thereto.
Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against the
U.S. federal income tax liability of a US Ecology stockholder, provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS. The IRS may impose a penalty upon an US Ecology stockholder that fails to provide
the correct taxpayer identification number.
Regulatory Clearances
Required Approvals - Under the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot be completed until any applicable
waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR
Act”) has expired or been terminated. US Ecology and Republic Services made the necessary filings with the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
on February 28, 2022.
Even after the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expires or is terminated, the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before or
after the merger is completed. Likewise, at any time before or after the consummation of the merger, a U.S.
state or a foreign governmental authority with jurisdiction over the parties could take such action under
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
consummation of the merger, to rescind the merger or to seek divestiture of particular assets. Private parties
also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. Neither US Ecology
nor Republic Services can provide assurance that any action under antitrust laws will not result in the delay
or abandonment of the merger.
The Merger Agreement also provides that the merger cannot be completed until the following regulatory
approvals, in addition to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act,
have been received:
All necessary approvals under any antitrust and foreign direct investment laws applicable to the
merger (including the requisite approval of the Turkish Competition Authority, which has been
received); and
Any necessary approval or written non-objection by the State of Washington in connection with the
transfer of (i) Radioactive Materials License WN-I019-2 issued by the Washington State Department
of Health and (ii) US Ecology’s Sublease with the Washington Department of Ecology, in each case,
in connection with US Ecology’s site activities in Hanford, Washington or operations in Richland,
Washington.
Commitments to Obtain Regulatory Approvals - The parties to the Merger Agreement must, and must cause
their respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain and to cooperate in
obtaining any regulatory approvals required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the
Merger Agreement and as required to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
US Ecology and Republic Services have agreed to:
Cause, and cause their respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain and to cooperate in obtaining any regulatory approvals required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement and as required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby
Cause, and cause their respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to
vigorously oppose any challenge instituted or threatened by a government entity or private party,
under the HSR Act or any other antitrust law, asserted with respect to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement
68

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Sell or divest assets (belonging to Republic Services or US Ecology or any of their respective
subsidiaries) if required in order to obtain antitrust approval.
However, Republic Services is not required to sell assets that would, individually or in the aggregate, reduce
the aggregate annual revenue of Republic Services and its subsidiaries (including US Ecology and its
subsidiaries) after giving effect to the closing by more than $60,000,000 in total sales (based on total sales of
the year ended December 31, 2021) (any such individual action or combination of actions, a “Burdensome
Condition”) (as more fully described in the “Efforts to Complete the Merger; Regulatory Approvals” section of
this Proxy Statement).
De-listing and De-registration of US Ecology Common Stock
If the merger is completed, US Ecology common stock and warrants will be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-
registered under the Exchange Act. As such, following the completion of the merger, US Ecology will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Litigation Relating to the Merger
Commencing on March 15, 2022, purported individual stockholders of US Ecology filed complaints in the
United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York, for the Eastern District of New York, and
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in the matters captioned Ryan O’Dell v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No.
22-cv-2131 (S.D.N.Y., filed Mar. 15, 2022) (“O’Dell”), Ray Pizzaro v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No. 22-cv-02144
(S.D.N.Y., filed Mar. 15, 2022) (“Pizzaro”), Matthew Whitfield v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No. 22-cv-01515
(E.D.N.Y., filed Mar. 18, 2022) (“Whitfield”), Lewis D. Baker v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No. 22-cv-01053 (E.D.
Pa., filed Mar. 18, 2022) (“Baker”), and Teresa McCurdy v. US Ecology, Inc. et al, No. 22-cv-01685 (E.D.N.Y.,
filed Mar. 25, 2022) (“McCurdy,” and together, the “Transaction Litigation”). The complaints in the
Transaction Litigation name as defendants the Company and the members of the Board.
The complaints in the Transaction Litigation generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by US
Ecology with the SEC on March 11, 2022, in connection with the Merger Agreement is materially incomplete
and misleading by allegedly failing to disclose purportedly material information relating to the sale process
leading to the proposed transaction, the Company’s financial projections, and the analyses performed by the
Co-Financial Advisors. Each of the Complaints asserts violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, Rule
14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the complaint in the
Pizzaro action also asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty by the members of the Board in connection
with the approval of the Merger Agreement and the disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement, and a
claim against US Ecology for aiding and abetting the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The Transaction
Litigation seeks, among other things, an injunction of the proposed transaction, rescission of the Merger
Agreement, a declaratory judgment that the Company and the Board violated the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-
9 promulgated thereunder, damages, plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and expenses, and any other relief the court
may deem just and proper.
While US Ecology cannot predict the outcome of each Transaction Litigation, US Ecology believes that the
cases are without merit and US Ecology and its directors intend to defend vigorously against the
Transaction Litigation.
It is possible that additional similar complaints could be filed in connection with the proposed transaction. If
additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or significantly different allegations, US Ecology will not
necessarily disclose such additional complaints or filings.
In addition to the Transaction Litigation, the Company has received letters from three purported
stockholders of the Company demanding additional disclosures related to the Company's financial
projections and the analyses performed by the Co-Financial Advisors.

Proxy Statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement. This
summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger
Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety

Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this Proxy Statement.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The following summary of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 8, 2022, by and among
US Ecology, Republic Services and Merger Sub and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached to this
Proxy Statement as Annex A, are intended only to provide information regarding the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement and the related summary are not intended to be a source of factual,
business or operational information about US Ecology, Republic Services or Merger Sub, and the following
summary of the Merger Agreement and the copy thereof included as Annex A are not intended to modify or
supplement any factual disclosure about US Ecology in any documents US Ecology has or will publicly file
with the SEC. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by, and covenants of, US
Ecology, Republic Services and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and
as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by
the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of
allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these
matters as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect
applicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
Merger Agreement may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may
or may not be fully reflected in US Ecology’s public disclosures. Until the effective time, stockholders are not
third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement (and after the effective time, stockholders will be third-
party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement solely to the extent necessary to receive the merger
consideration due to such persons under the Merger Agreement).
Additional information about US Ecology may be found elsewhere in this Proxy Statement and in US
Ecology’s other public filings. See the “Additional Information and Where to Find It” section of this Proxy
Statement.
Structure of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers
The Merger Agreement provides that at the effective time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
will cease, and US Ecology will continue as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Republic Services. At the effective time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of US Ecology and Merger Sub will vest in US Ecology as the surviving company and, pursuant
to the DGCL, all debts, liabilities and duties of US Ecology and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities
and duties of US Ecology as the surviving company. At the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of
US Ecology will be amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form of an exhibit to the Merger
Agreement and, as so amended and restated, such certificate of incorporation will be the certificate of
incorporation of the surviving company and the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
effective time will be the bylaws of the surviving company, in each case, until subsequently amended.
The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will become the initial directors of the
surviving company and the officers of US Ecology immediately prior to the effective time will become the
initial officers of the surviving company. The initial directors and officers will hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
company.
70 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Closing of the Merger
The closing will take place on the third business day following the day on which the conditions to the
merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of those conditions at the closing) have
been satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement or at such other time, date and place as
US Ecology and Republic Services may agree in writing.
On the closing date, Republic Services and US Ecology will cause a certificate of merger to be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The merger will become effective
at the time the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on
such later date and time as may be agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger.
Effect of the Merger on US Ecology Common Stock
At the effective time, each share of US Ecology common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time (other than Excluded Shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the
merger consideration, and upon conversion, will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Each
share of US Ecology common stock owned by Republic Services, US Ecology (whether held in treasury or
otherwise), or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of US Ecology or Republic Services (including
Merger Sub) will cease to exist at the effective time and will be cancelled without payment of any
consideration. Each share of US Ecology common stock owned by stockholders who will have neither voted
in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented thereto in writing with respect to such shares
and who will have demanded and properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to the rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL (as
further described in the “Appraisal Rights” section of this Proxy Statement).
At the effective time, each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving company and such shares
will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving company immediately following
the effective time.
Payment Procedures
Prior to the effective time, Republic Services will appoint a paying agent (the “paying agent”) to act as the
paying agent for the US Ecology stockholders in connection with the merger. At the closing, Republic
Services will deposit, or cause the surviving corporation to deposit, with the paying agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the merger consideration (which cash we refer to as the “Payment Fund”). Republic
Services will not be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent funds sufficient to
pay the merger consideration payable in respect of the Excluded Shares (as further described in the
“Appraisal Rights” section of this Proxy Statement). Subject to certain conditions in the Merger Agreement,
the paying agent is required to invest the Payment Fund as directed by Republic Services.
Promptly after the effective time (but in any event not later than the third business day after the effective
time), Republic Services shall send, or shall cause the paying agent to send, to each record holder of shares
of US Ecology common stock at the effective time, whose US Ecology common stock was converted into the
right to receive the merger consideration at closing, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the certificates or transfer of the book-entry shares with respect to the applicable US Ecology common stock
to the paying agent, and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Republic Services and the surviving company may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange. Upon
surrender of the certificates to the paying agent for cancellation, together with the letter of transmittal, the
holder of the shares will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and the surrendered certificates will
be cancelled.
Any holder of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the paying agent to receive the merger consideration. Each registered holder of one or more
71 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
book-entry shares will be entitled at the effective time to receive the merger consideration for each book-
entry share upon receipt by the paying agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form.
No interest will be paid on any cash payable to holders of stock certificates or book-entry shares under the
Merger Agreement. From and after the effective time, holders of shares of US Ecology common stock will
cease to have any rights as stockholders of US Ecology, except as provided in the Merger Agreement or by
law.
Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of US Ecology
common stock 12 months after the effective time will be delivered to the surviving company, and any former
holders of shares of US Ecology common stock who are entitled to do so and have not exchanged shares of
US Ecology common stock for the merger consideration prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
surviving company or Republic Services, as applicable, for payment of their claim for the merger
consideration.
Under the Merger Agreement, each of the paying agent, the surviving company and any applicable
withholding agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of US Ecology common stock, US Ecology stock options, performance stock unit awards and
restricted share unit awards, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payment under all applicable federal, state or local tax laws and pay such withholding amount over to the
appropriate governmental authority.
Treatment of US Ecology Equity Awards under the Merger Agreement
Under the Merger Agreement, all outstanding stock options, performance stock units, restricted stock unit
awards and restricted shares of US Ecology, whether vested or unvested, under the Amended and Restated
US Ecology, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan will automatically vest and settle in cash based on the value of the
merger consideration, rather than being assumed by, and converted into equity awards of Republic Services,
to the extent described in the “Treatment of US Ecology Equity Awards in the Merger” section of this Proxy
Statement.
Appraisal Rights
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, shares of US Ecology common stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and that are held by US Ecology stockholders
who have neither voted for the merger nor consented to the merger in writing with respect to such shares
and who have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, we refer to such shares as the
“dissenting shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the merger consideration,
unless and until such holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal
under the DGCL. At the effective time, all dissenting shares will no longer be outstanding and automatically
will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by applicable laws, each holder of
dissenting shares will cease to have any rights with respect to the dissenting shares, other than such rights
as are granted under Section 262 of the DGCL. Such stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL,
except that all dissenting shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the effective time, the
right to receive the merger consideration, without interest, upon surrender, in the manner provided in the
Merger Agreement, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares (if any).
US Ecology is required to give Republic Services (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal
received by US Ecology or any of its representatives, withdrawals of such demands and any other related
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by US Ecology or any of its representatives and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands

for appraisal under the DGCL. US Ecology will not, except with the prior written consent of Republic
Services, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle, or offer to settle any such
demands.
Representations and Warranties; Material Adverse Effect
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of US Ecology and of Republic Services and
Merger Sub. Subject to certain exceptions (i) in the Merger Agreement, (ii) in the disclosure letter delivered
by US Ecology to Republic Services and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger Agreement (which we
refer to as the “disclosure letter”) and (iii) as disclosed in US Ecology public filings with the SEC (subject to
certain specified exceptions), the Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of US Ecology
as to, among other things:
US Ecology’s organization, good standing and power, governing documents and subsidiaries;
US Ecology’s authority to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the merger;
US Ecology’s capital structure;
Authority, non-contravention, contractual or governmental consents required in connection with the
merger, board approval and anti-takeover statutes;
US Ecology’s financial statements and filings with the SEC;
Taxes;
Intellectual property;
Compliance, permits;
Litigation;
Brokers’ and finders’ fees;
Transactions with affiliates and related persons;
US Ecology’s employees and employee benefit plans
Property matters;
Environmental matters;
Material contracts;

Compliance with anti-corruption and other laws and regulations; and
Fairness opinions.
Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are qualified by knowledge or
materiality qualifications including, in certain instances, a “material adverse effect” qualification with respect
to US Ecology.
For purposes of this summary of the Merger Agreement, a “material adverse effect”  (which is described in
the Merger Agreement as a “Company Material Adverse Effect”) with respect to US Ecology means any
event, circumstance, development, occurrence, fact, condition, effect, or change that is, or would reasonably
be expected to become, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the condition, results of

accountants, agents, properties, offices, and other facilities and to all books, records, contracts, and other
assets of US Ecology and its subsidiaries, and to furnish information concerning the business, properties
and financial and operating performance of US Ecology and its subsidiaries as Republic Services may

Ecology has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce the
making or submission of, or knowingly encourage or facilitate in any way any offer, inquiry or proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or (ii)
continue, enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
(and their respective representatives) regarding any Takeover Proposal (or inquiries, offers or proposals or
any other effort or attempt that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal), provided that
US Ecology may communicate with third parties in order to notify those parties of the existence of these
contractual restrictions under the Merger Agreement. US Ecology has also agreed that, after entering into
the Merger Agreement, (a) it will not grant a waiver, amendment or release (to the extent not automatically
waived, amended or released upon the announcement of, or entering into the Merger Agreement) any
“standstill” provisions of any contract to which US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries is a party relating to a
Takeover Proposal, and (b) it will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties previously conducted with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, “Takeover Proposal” means an inquiry, proposal, or offer from, or indication
of interest in making a proposal or offer by, any person or group (other than Republic Services and its
subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), relating to any transaction or series of related transactions (other than
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement), involving any: (a) direct or indirect acquisition of
assets of US Ecology or its subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the fair market value of US Ecology’s and its
subsidiaries’ consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of US Ecology’s and its subsidiaries’ net revenues
or net income on a consolidated basis are attributable; (b) direct or indirect acquisition of 20% or more of the
voting equity interests of US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of

group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income, or assets of US
75 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ecology and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (e) liquidation, dissolution (or the adoption of a plan of
liquidation or dissolution), or recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of US Ecology or
one or more of its subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate, generate or constitute 20% or more of
the consolidated net revenues, net income, or assets of US Ecology and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or
(f) any combination of the foregoing.
The US Ecology Board Recommendation; Change of Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception - Under the
Merger Agreement, generally, the Board may not (i) withdraw (or qualify, amend or modify in any manner

endorse, approve, adopt or recommend, or declare the advisability of, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to
recommend against any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business
days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (iv) fail to timely publicly affirm the
Board’s recommendation in favor of the merger following a reasonable written request by Republic Services
to provide such reaffirmation.
However, prior to the receipt of the US Ecology stockholder approval, the Board, in certain circumstances
and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, may (i) take certain of the actions
described in the immediately preceding paragraph or terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) and (ii) take certain of the actions described in the immediately
preceding paragraph in connection with an Intervening Event (as defined below), unrelated to any Takeover
Proposal, in each case, subject to specified notice obligations to Republic Services and specified obligations
to negotiate and consider in good faith any modifications proposed by Republic Services to the Merger
Agreement. The Board is permitted to make a change of the Board recommendation or enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal after providing Republic Services with a period of good faith
negotiation.
Under the Merger Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, unsolicited written Takeover
Proposal (except that any reference in the definition of “Takeover Proposal” to “20% or more” are treated as
“more than 50%”) that provides greater value to the holders of US Ecology common stock than the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account: (i) all financial considerations
(including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation); (ii) the
identity of the third party making such Takeover Proposal; (iii) the anticipated timing, conditions (including
any financing condition or the reliability of any debt or equity funding commitments) and prospects for
completion of such Takeover Proposal; (iv) the other terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and
the implications thereof on US Ecology, including, for each of (i) through (iv), all relevant legal, regulatory,
and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal deemed relevant by the Board (including any conditions
relating to financing, stockholder approval, regulatory approvals, or other events or circumstances beyond
the control of the party invoking the condition); and (v) any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement
and the merger proposed by Republic Services.
Under the Merger Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions in the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening
Event” means, with respect to US Ecology, any material event, circumstance, change, effect, development, or
condition occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement that was not known to, nor reasonably
foreseeable by, any member of the Board, as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement and did not
result from or arise out of the announcement or pendency of, or any actions required to be taken by US
Ecology (or to be refrained from being taken by US Ecology) pursuant to, the Merger Agreement.
Special Meeting - US Ecology has agreed to take all actions necessary in accordance with its governing
documents and applicable law in order to convene the Special Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of the Merger Agreement, and to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from US Ecology
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the merger. US
Ecology may be required to, at Republic Services’ request, postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting to allow
for additional time to solicit proxies, to establish a quorum, or to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure. Additionally, even if the Board changes its
recommendation in favor of the merger, US Ecology may nevertheless be required to submit the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and the approval of the merger to a vote of US Ecology’s stockholders.

retain, any assets, businesses, services, products, product lines, relationships or contractual rights, in each
case, as may be required or advisable to obtain any required regulatory approvals (including under the HSR
Act) or to avoid the entry of any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order relating to such

delaying the consummation of the merger beyond August 8, 2023. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Merger Agreement shall not require Republic Services to agree to any Burdensome Condition.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Burdensome Condition” is any individual or combination of

Merger Agreement that would prevent the conditions to closing from being satisfied prior to
August 8, 2023 or, if curable, that has not been cured after 30 days’ prior written notice from

representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement that would prevent the
conditions to closing from being satisfied prior to August 8, 2023 or, if curable, that has not

If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination rights summarized above in this
section, the Merger Agreement will become void and of no further force or effect and there will be no liability
or obligation on the part of any party, except for the confidentiality provisions, provisions relating to the
effect of termination (including the termination fees described in the “Termination Fee” section of this Proxy
Statement) and certain other specified general provisions of the Merger Agreement, each of which will
survive the termination of the Merger Agreement.
Termination Fee
Under the Merger Agreement, US Ecology is required to pay Republic Services a termination fee in the
amount of $46,253,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the applicable party under the following
specified circumstances:
If Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement because there has been a material willful
breach by US Ecology of the “no shop” covenant;

recommendation in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining the US Ecology
stockholder approval at the Special Meeting or US Ecology has approved or adopted, or
recommended the approval or adoption of, any alternative acquisition agreement;
If US Ecology terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into a transaction that constitutes a Superior
Proposal prior to its receipt of the requisite Company stockholder vote; or

either the effective time has not occurred on or before August 8, 2023, or a law or injunction has been
enacted by any governmental entity which enjoins the merger, and at the time of such termination the only
conditions to the closing which have not been satisfied are the condition relating to required regulatory
approvals (including under the HSR Act), the condition relating to whether a law or injunction has been
enacted by any governmental entity which enjoins the merger and/or the condition relating to the imposition
of a Burdensome Condition, then Republic Services will be required to reimburse US Ecology for 50% of its

for an additional approval.
At any time prior to the effective time, the parties to the Merger Agreement may extend the time for
performance of the other parties’ obligations under the Merger Agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties in the Merger Agreement, or waive compliance with any
of the covenants, agreements, or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement. Any such extension or
waiver must be in writing, and the failure of any party to assert any of its rights under the Merger Agreement
or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver by any party of a breach of any provision
of the Merger Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior to subsequent breach of
the same or any other provision of the Merger Agreement.
Expenses
Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, each of the parties has agreed to bear its own
expenses in connection with the Merger Agreement. However, Republic Services must pay all filing fees in
connection with any required regulatory approvals (including under the HSR Act) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction
The Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law.
The parties have agreed to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter arising out of the
Merger Agreement. The parties have also agreed to waive all rights to a jury trial arising out of the Merger
Agreement.

PROPOSAL NO. 2
ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, US Ecology is providing
its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the “golden parachute”
compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the completion of
the merger, as disclosed in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled “Interests of US Ecology Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 61 (and in particular in the table captioned “Merger-
Related Compensation Table”).
Your vote is requested. US Ecology believes that the information regarding merger-related compensation that
may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger, as
disclosed in the “Interests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” section of this Proxy
Statement, is reasonable and demonstrates that US Ecology’s executive compensation program was designed
appropriately and structured to ensure the retention of talented executives and a strong alignment with the
long-term interests of US Ecology’s stockholders. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of
compensation, but rather the overall “golden parachute” compensation that may become payable to US
Ecology’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger. Accordingly, US
Ecology asks that its stockholders vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the merger-related compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger, as disclosed in the “Interests of US
Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” section of this Proxy Statement, and the related
table and narratives, is hereby APPROVED.”
This vote is advisory and therefore, it will not be binding on US Ecology, nor will it overrule any prior
decision or require US Ecology’s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) to take any action. However,
the Board values the opinions of US Ecology’s stockholders and to the extent that there is any significant
vote against the named executive officer merger-related compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement,
the Board will consider stockholders’ concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to
address those concerns.
Assuming that a quorum is present, the approval of the advisory proposal on merger-related compensation
requires that a majority of the votes cast at the Special Meeting be cast “FOR” the advisory proposal.
Assuming that a quorum is present, an abstention from voting on the advisory proposal on merger-related
compensation will have no effect on the advisory proposal. If your shares are held in street name by your
broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your failure to
do so will have no effect on the advisory proposal on merger-related compensation assuming that a quorum
is present.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” 
the approval of the resolution set forth above.

"US Ecology, Inc._20220329_DEFM14A_19977995_4426339.Pdf",APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
If the Merger Agreement is adopted by US Ecology stockholders, stockholders who do not vote in favor of
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for
appraisal of their shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”)
will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation
that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of US
Ecology common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
person having a beneficial interest in shares of US Ecology common stock held of record in the name of
another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to
follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold
your shares of US Ecology common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of US Ecology common stock who do not vote in favor of the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement with respect to such shares, who duly demand appraisal in respect of such
shares, who continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time, and who
otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to the appraisal by the Delaware
Court of Chancery of the fair value of their shares of US Ecology common stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value of the shares from the effective date of the merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings,
the surviving company may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii)
interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This Proxy
Statement constitutes US Ecology’s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement.
In connection with the merger, any holder of US Ecology common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully. Failure to
strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal
rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the
merger consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest. Moreover, because of the
complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of US Ecology common
stock, if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, US Ecology urges such stockholder to seek the
advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of US Ecology common stock
must do ALL of the following:
The stockholder must NOT vote such shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will,
unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and
who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares;
The stockholder must deliver to US Ecology a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
88 • 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The stockholder must continuously hold the shares of US Ecology common stock from the date of
making the demand through the effective time. A stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the
stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time; and
A stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (or any person
who is the beneficial owner of shares entitled to appraisal held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person and for which such record holder has complied with such requirements), or
the surviving company, must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal within 120 days after the
effective time. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of US Ecology
stockholders to take all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of US
Ecology common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of US Ecology common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to US
Ecology, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the
appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not submit a blank proxy that is not revoked
or vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A holder of shares of US Ecology common
stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal with
respect to such shares and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing
instructions to vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain from voting on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or not vote its shares. Neither voting against the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the
taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of US Ecology
stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of US Ecology common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of US Ecology common stock
should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform US Ecology of the
identity of the holder and that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in
connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand
must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for
2 or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the
agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH
THEIR BROKERS, BANKS AND NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF
RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE,
MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
89 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to US Ecology, Inc.,
101 S. Capitol Blvd., Suite 1000, Boise, Idaho 83702, Attention: Secretary, and must be delivered before the
vote on the Merger Agreement is taken at the Special Meeting and should be executed by, or on behalf of,
the record holder of the shares of US Ecology common stock.
Any holder of US Ecology common stock who has no commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration
offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to US Ecology a written withdrawal of the demand
for appraisal within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. However, any such attempt to withdraw the
demand made more than 60 days after the effective time will require written approval of the surviving
company. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that such requirement will not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered pursuant to the merger
(without interest) within 60 calendar days after the effective time of the merger.
Notice by the Surviving Company
If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time, the surviving company will notify each
holder of US Ecology common stock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date
thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving company or any holder of US
Ecology common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a
copy served on the surviving company in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving
company is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition, and holders should not
assume that the surviving company will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair
value of shares of US Ecology common stock. Accordingly, any holders of US Ecology common stock who
desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in
respect of shares of US Ecology common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.
The failure of a holder of US Ecology common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in
Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time, any holder of US Ecology common stock who has complied with the
requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving company a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and with respect to which US Ecology has received demands for
appraisal and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving company must provide this
statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a
statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever
is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person
may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving company the
foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a
stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of US Ecology common stock (or any such
beneficial owner) and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving company, the surviving company will then
be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as
required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to
90 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment
for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of
the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. In addition, the Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the US Ecology common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii)
the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of US Ecology common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will appraise the fair value of the shares of US Ecology common stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will
be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and
the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the
surviving company may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii)
interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc. (“Weinberger”) the Supreme
Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that
“[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The
Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider
market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant
factors the Court of Chancery may consider in determining fair value and that absent deficiencies in the sale
process the transaction price should be given “considerable weight.” Section 262 provides that fair value is
to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme
Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the
consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and
that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262. Although US Ecology believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as
to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as,
the merger consideration. Neither US Ecology nor Republic Services anticipates offering more than the merger
consideration to any stockholder of US Ecology exercising appraisal rights, and each of US Ecology and
Republic Services reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262,
the fair value of a share of US Ecology common stock is less than the merger consideration. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings
(which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
91 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged
pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of US Ecology common stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses his or her appraisal rights, or successfully withdraws such demand for appraisal, the
stockholder’s shares of US Ecology common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective
time into the right to receive the merger consideration applicable to the shares, less applicable withholding
taxes, without interest. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or lose, his or her appraisal rights, or, subject to the
limitations on withdrawing a demand for appraisal summarized herein, effectively withdraw a demand for
appraisal, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time or if the stockholder
delivers to the surviving company a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote
US Ecology common stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the
stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of US Ecology common stock, if any,
payable to stockholders of US Ecology of record as of a time prior to the effective time; provided, however,
that, if no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party delivers to the surviving company a written
withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the
effective time or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving company, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of
Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder of US Ecology
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery (except with respect to a stockholder who
withdraws an appraisal demand within 60 days after the effective time and has not commenced the appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party).
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder of US Ecology wishing to exercise appraisal rights is
encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",95,99

If the merger is completed, there will be no public participation in any of our future stockholder meetings
because following completion of the merger, US Ecology’s common stock will be de-listed from Nasdaq and
de-registered under the Exchange Act, and US Ecology will no longer be a publicly-traded company.
However, if the merger is not completed, US Ecology’s stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and
participate in future Annual Meetings of Stockholders when held. US Ecology will hold an Annual Meeting
of Stockholders in 2022 only if the merger has not already been completed, which we refer to as the “2022
Annual Meeting.”
If the 2022 Annual Meeting is held, stockholders may submit proposals for consideration at our 2022 Annual
Meeting. Proposals of stockholders that are intended to be presented at the 2022 Annual Meeting must
comply with the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8. A stockholder’s proposal must be delivered to or mailed and
received by us no later than December 14, 2021 in order for it to be included in US Ecology’s proxy statement
and form of proxy relating to the 2022 Annual Meeting. If the date of the 2022 Annual Meeting has been
changed by more than 30 days from May 25, 2022, then the deadline is a reasonable time before US Ecology
begins to print and send its proxy materials.
Our amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business or director
nominations before an annual meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of such proposed
business in writing in order to be considered by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting. To
be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered personally to, or mailed to and received at, US Ecology,
Inc., 101 S. Capitol Blvd., Suite 1000, Boise, Idaho 83702, Attention: Secretary, not less than 90 days nor more
than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which US Ecology held the preceding year’s
annual meeting. A timely proposal must therefore be delivered no earlier than January 25, 2022, and no later
92 TABLE OF CONTENTS
than February 24, 2022. In the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 or
delayed by more than 60 days from the anniversary date of the previous year’s meeting, or if no annual
meeting was held during the prior year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not
earlier than 120 days prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
90  day prior to such annual meeting or the 10  day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of such meeting is first made. Public announcement of an adjournment, deferral or postponement of an
annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a
stockholder’s notice. The notice must also describe the stockholder proposal in reasonable detail and
provide certain other information required by US Ecology amended and restated bylaws. A copy of US
Ecology’s amended and restated bylaws is available upon request without charge from the Secretary of US
Ecology at the address set forth above.
All matters submitted must comply with the applicable requirements or conditions established by the SEC
and our bylaws. Any proposals of business or nominations should be addressed to: US Ecology, Inc., 101 S.

Board of Directors 
US Ecology, Inc. 
101 S. Capitol Blvd., Suite 1000 
Boise, Idaho 83702
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that US Ecology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) intends to enter into a
transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”) with Republic Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”) and
Bronco Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”),
pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company
surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (b) at the Effective Time (as defined in the
Agreement (as defined below)), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement) or any Cancelled Shares (as defined in the Agreement))
will be converted into the right to receive $48.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). The
terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, to be dated as of February 9, 2022 (the
“Agreement”). The summary of the Proposed Transaction set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the
terms of the Agreement.
We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s stockholders (other than the holders of any
Dissenting Shares or any Cancelled Shares (collectively, the “Excluded Stockholders”)) of the Merger
Consideration to be offered to such stockholders in the Proposed Transaction. We have not been requested
to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business
decision to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the
Proposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner
address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger
Consideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the Proposed Transaction. In addition, we
express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the
nature of any compensation to any holder of warrants issued by the Company, or any class of such persons,
or the treatment of any such warrants in or adjustments to their terms and conditions resulting from the
Proposed Transaction, relative to the treatment of the Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration to
be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the Proposed Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion does
not address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to any other transaction or
business strategy in which the Company might engage.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) a draft of the Agreement, dated as of February 8,
2022, and the specific terms of the Proposed Transaction; (2) publicly available information concerning the
Company that we believe to be relevant to our analysis, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March
31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021; (3) financial and operating information with respect to the
business, operations and prospects of the Company furnished to us by the Company, including financial
projections of the Company prepared by management of the Company (the “Company Projections”); (4) a
trading history of the Company’s common stock from January 1, 2021 to January 25, 2022 and a comparison
of that trading history with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (5) a
B-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of the Company and certain
multiples of financial metrics based on the financial metrics of the Company with those of other companies
that we deemed relevant; (6)published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future
financial performance and price targets of the Company; and (7) a comparison of the financial terms of the
Proposed Transaction with the financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant. In
addition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects and have undertaken such other studies,
analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial
and other information used by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not
assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information) and have further
relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Company
Projections, upon the advice of the Company, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and that the Company will perform
substantially in accordance with such projections. We assume no responsibility for and we express no view
as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving at our
opinion, we have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and
have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. In
addition, you have not authorized us to solicit, and we have not solicited, any indications of interest from
any third party with respect to the purchase of all or a part of the Company’s business. Our opinion
necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as they exist on, and can be evaluated as
of, the date of this letter. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on events
or circumstances that may occur after the date of this letter.
We have assumed that the executed Agreement will conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed
by us. In addition, we have assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the
Agreement and all agreements related thereto. We have also assumed, upon the advice of the Company, that
all material governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and releases for the Proposed
Transaction will be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Agreement and that the Proposed
Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver,
modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. We do not express any
opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Proposed Transaction, nor does our
opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the
Company has obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that, from a financial
point of view, the Merger Consideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company (other than the
Excluded Stockholders) in the Proposed Transaction is fair to such stockholders.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Proposed Transaction and will
receive a fees for our services, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial
portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, the
Company has agreed to reimburse our reasonable expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities that may
arise out of our engagement. We have performed various investment banking services for the Company and
Parent in the past, and expect to perform such services in the future, and have received, and expect to
receive, customary fees for such services. Specifically, in the past two years, we have performed the
following investment banking and financial services: (i) we are currently acting as a lender and co-
documentation agent under Parent’s revolving credit facility; (ii) we acted as an underwriter and joint book
running manager in connection with Parent’s $400.0 million notes offering in February 2020; (iii) we acted as
an underwriter and joint book running manager in connection with Parent’s $600.0 million notes offering in
February 2020; (iv) we acted as an underwriter and joint book running manager in connection with Parent’s
$650.0 million notes offering in August 2020; (v) we acted as an underwriter and co-manager in connection
with Parent’s $750.0 million notes offering in November 2020; (vi) we acted as an underwriter, joint book
running manager and billing and delivery agent in connection with Parent’s $350.0 million notes offering in
November 2020;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
and (vii) we acted as an underwriter and joint book running manager in connection with Parent’s $700.0
million notes offering in November 2021. We have not performed any investment banking services for the
Company for which we have earned fees in the past two years.
Barclays Capital Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment
and commercial banking, lending, asset management and other financial and non-financial services. In the
ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade and effect transactions in the
equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans
and other obligations) of the Company and Parent for our own account and for the accounts of our
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities
and financial instruments.
This opinion, the issuance of which has been approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee, is for the use
and benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company and is rendered to the Board of Directors in connection
with its consideration of the Proposed Transaction. This opinion is not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote
with respect to the Proposed Transaction.

We understand that Republic Services, Inc. (the “Acquiror”), Bronco Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned

right to receive $48.00 in cash (the “Consideration”).
The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested that Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.
(“Houlihan Lokey”) provide an opinion (the “Opinion”) to the Board as to whether, as of the date hereof, the
Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Transaction pursuant to the
Agreement is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.
In connection with this Opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as we have deemed
necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. Among other things, we have:
reviewed a draft dated February 8, 2022 of the Agreement;
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
we deemed to be relevant, including certain publicly available research analyst estimates with
respect to the future financial performance of the Company;

reviewed the current and historical market prices and trading volume for certain of the Company’s
publicly traded securities, and the current and historical market prices of the publicly traded
securities of certain other companies that we deemed to be relevant; and
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other
information and factors as we deemed appropriate.
We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all
data, material and other information furnished, or otherwise made available, to us, discussed with or
reviewed by us, or publicly available, and do not assume any responsibility with respect to such data,
material and other information. In addition, management of the Company has advised us, and we have
assumed, that the financial projections (and adjustments thereto) reviewed by us have been reasonably
prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such
management as to the future financial results and condition of the Company and the other matters covered
thereby, and we express no opinion with respect to such projections or the assumptions on which they are
based. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there has been no change
in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the
Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial
or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion, and that there is no
information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading.
We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and
warranties of all parties to the Agreement identified in item 1 above and all other related documents and
instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct, (b) each party to the Agreement and other
related documents and instruments will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required
to be performed by such party, (c) all conditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied
without waiver thereof, and (d) the Transaction will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with
the terms described in the Agreement and other related documents and instruments, without any
amendments or modifications thereto. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification,
that (i) the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable
federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that no delay, limitations,
restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an
effect on the Transaction or the Company that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion. We have
also relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, at the direction of the Company, that any
adjustments to the Consideration pursuant to the Agreement will not be material to our analyses or this
Opinion. In addition, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final form
of the Agreement will not differ in any respect from the draft of the Agreement identified above.
Furthermore, in connection with this Opinion, we have not been requested to make, and have not made, any
physical inspection or independent appraisal or evaluation of any of the assets, properties or liabilities
(fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company or any other party, nor were
we provided with any such appraisal or evaluation. We did not estimate, and express no opinion regarding,
the liquidation value of any entity or business. We have undertaken no independent analysis of any
potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to
which the Company is or may be a party or is or may be subject, or of any governmental investigation of any
possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which the Company is or may be a party or is or
may be subject.
We have not been requested to, and did not, initiate any discussions or negotiations with, or solicit any
indications of interest from, third parties with respect to the securities, assets, business or operations of the
Company or any other party, or any alternatives to the Transaction. This Opinion is necessarily based on

Section 2.01. Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent,
Merger Sub, or the Company:
(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by Parent or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Cancelled Shares”) will
automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor.
(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive $48.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
(c) Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b) will no longer be outstanding and all
shares of Company Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to
Section 2.03 [Dissenting Shares], each holder of: (i) a certificate formerly representing any shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”); or (ii) any book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) will,
A-2 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02 [Surrender and
Payment].
(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one newly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers, and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub common stock shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(a) Paying Agent; Payment Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent (the
“Paying Agent”) to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration for: (i) the
Certificates; and (ii) the Book-Entry Shares. In connection therewith, Parent shall enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares under Section 2.01(b) (for the avoidance of doubt, other than:
(A) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a); (B) Dissenting Shares and (C)
Company Restricted Shares, which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be treated in accordance with Section
2.07) (the “Payment Fund”) in amounts and at the times necessary for such payments. If as a result of
investment losses the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders shall be entitled
under Section 2.01(b), Parent shall take all reasonable steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving
Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all
payments required under this Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Promptly
after the Effective Time (but in any event not later than the third Business Days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company
Common Stock at the Effective Time, whose Company Common Stock was converted pursuant to Section
2.01(b) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which letter of transmittal will
be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably specify) for use in such exchange.
(b) Procedures for Surrender; No Interest. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
upon: (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent; or (ii)
receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, and subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be
cancelled.
(c) Investment of Payment Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the cash in the Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in: (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States; (ii) short-term

Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
waives, withdraws, or loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court

(iv) Without limitation to the Company’s rights under this Section 5.03(d), the following actions shall
not (in and of themselves) constitute a Company Board Change of Recommendation, or otherwise

(f) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall promptly request that
each Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior to the

any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent or the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or

promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the
Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Parent a reasonable

Company). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement at the
date that it (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent, or given to the stockholders
of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, to (i) comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each party agrees to consult
and reasonably cooperate with the other party in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Company
Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement
in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to
responding to SEC comments with respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement (and Parent’s
comments thereto shall be reasonably reflected by the Company). Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the
Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which
shall have become false or misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders
an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction. The Company shall promptly: (i) notify Parent of

the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information; and (ii) provide Parent with

the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement.
