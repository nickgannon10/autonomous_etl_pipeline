The Merger
(page 32)
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

(the “Exchange Act”), and Altra will no longer file periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). If the Merger
is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger will become effective at such time as the certificate
of merger with respect to the Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
at such later time as may be agreed by Altra and Regal Rexnord prior to filing the certificate of merger and specified in the certificate of merger (the

Background of the Merger
(page 34)
A description of the process we undertook that led to the Merger, including our discussions with Regal Rexnord, is included in this proxy statement
under the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Background of the Merger”.
Merger Consideration
(page 33)
Altra Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Altra, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of
Altra or Merger Sub, each share of Altra common stock issued and
 
2
Table of Contents
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (a) shares of Altra common stock owned by the Company, any wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, (b) shares of Altra common stock owned by stockholders of the
Company who have validly exercised (and not withdrawn) their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL and (c) Company Restricted
Shares (collectively, “Excluded Altra Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $62.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”) and subject to any required tax withholding.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures”) a cash amount that is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all shares of Altra common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Altra Shares).
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures”.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Altra common stock that you
own (other than Excluded Altra Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to any required tax withholding), but you will no longer have any
rights as an Altra stockholder (except that Altra stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will not be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and instead shall have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant
to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by the DGCL). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights”.
Treatment of Company Equity-Based Awards
(page 33)
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows:
 
•
each outstanding option to purchase shares of Altra common stock (a “Company Option”) that is vested and exercisable as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided that any such Company
Option with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be converted into
an award of stock options to purchase a number of Parent common shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii)
a conversion ratio described below, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per
share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the conversion ratio. The conversion ratio is the
quotient of (1) the Merger Consideration divided by (2) the average of the volume-weighted averages of the trading prices of shares of
Parent common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported by Bloomberg L.P.) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending
on (and including) the trading day that is three trading days prior to the date of the closing of the Merger (the “Equity Award Conversion
Ratio”). Each converted Company Option will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and
exercisability as were applicable to the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
3
Table of Contents
•
each outstanding restricted stock unit of the Company subject only to time-based vesting requirements (a “Company RSU”) that is
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in Parent common shares
(rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company RSU will be subject
to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting as were applicable to the related Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (ii) an amount in cash equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend
equivalents;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements (a “Company PSU”) that is vested prior to the
Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the product of (x) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such vested Company PSU (assuming all applicable performance measures for vested
Company PSUs are satisfied at the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time), as determined by the Board in
consultation with Parent) and (y) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) an amount in cash equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend
equivalents;
 
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is unvested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into an award of time-based
restricted stock denominated in Parent common shares equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the sum of (x) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) (1) the
amount of any accrued unpaid dividend equivalents divided by (2) the Merger Consideration (assuming all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at (i) the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that
expires on or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of performance
(measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that is scheduled to expire after the Effective Time, in each case,
as determined by the Board in consultation with Parent) multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company
PSU will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting terms as were applicable to the applicable Company
PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the award will only be subject to time-based vesting conditions; and
 
•
each outstanding share of Altra common stock that is subject to forfeiture conditions, including those received as dividend equivalents (a
“Company Restricted Share”) will be converted into an award of restricted cash (a “Restricted Cash Award”) equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Merger Consideration. Each Restricted Cash Award will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and
forfeiture as were applicable to the applicable Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the form of
payment upon vesting and settlement will be in cash.

Awards”.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
(page 68)
The exchange of Altra common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, for such purposes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this
 
4
Table of Contents
proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who
exchanges shares of Altra common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives pursuant to the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Altra common stock
surrendered by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger.
With respect to a non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Altra common stock for cash in the Merger generally will not result in
tax to that non-U.S. Holder under U.S. federal income tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder has certain connections with the United States, but may be
subject to backup withholding tax unless the non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption
from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This description does not
address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to
special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state, local
and non-U.S. tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Appraisal Rights
(page 63)
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Altra
common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment
in cash for the fair value of their shares of Altra common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Court”), together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined
to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Altra common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as,
the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This
proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Altra common stock following
petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Altra
common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly
with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the
complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before
attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Altra common stock who (i) continuously holds such shares through the Effective Time, (ii)
has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the
procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial
owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides
documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it
 
5
Table of Contents
purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the
Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights”), will be
entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Altra common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The foregoing summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to
exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—
Appraisal Rights”.
Litigation Related to the Merger
(page 67)
On November 28, 2022, a complaint, captioned Shiva Stein v. Altra Industrial Motion Corp., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-10063, was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported Altra stockholder, and on November 29, 2022, a complaint, captioned Ryan
O’Dell v. Altra Industrial Motion Corp., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-10132, was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York by a
purported Altra stockholder, in each case naming as defendants Altra and members of the Board. The complaints allege, among other things, that the
defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation
of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek orders enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger, requiring the defendants to disclose
certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the preliminary proxy statement, rescinding the Merger in the event that it is
consummated or granting rescissory damages, accounting to the plaintiffs for all damages they suffered as a result of the alleged wrongdoing, awarding
costs, including attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.
On November 30, 2022, Altra received a demand letter from a purported Altra stockholder, Matthew Whitfield, alleging disclosure deficiencies in the
preliminary proxy statement relating to Altra’s financial projections and certain financial analyses performed by Altra’s financial advisor.
On December 1, 2022, Altra received a demand letter from a purported Altra stockholder, Robert Garfield, alleging disclosure deficiencies in the
preliminary proxy statement relating to Altra’s financial projections and certain financial analyses performed by Altra’s financial advisor.
On December 1, 2022, Altra received a demand letter from a purported Altra stockholder, Alex Ciccotelli, alleging disclosure deficiencies in the
preliminary proxy statement relating to Altra’s post-Merger employment arrangements, Altra’s financial projections and certain financial analyses
performed by Altra’s financial advisor.
These letters demand that Altra and members of the Board issue corrective disclosures to cure the alleged deficiencies in the proxy statement
disclosures prior to the anticipated stockholder vote on the Merger.
Altra believes that the complaints and demands are without merit and that no further disclosure is required to supplement the proxy statement
under applicable laws. As of December 13, 2022, Altra was not aware of the filing of other lawsuits or the submission of other demand letters challenging
the Merger and/or alleging deficiencies with respect to the proxy statement; however, such lawsuits or demand letters may be filed or submitted,
respectively, in the future.

(page 95)
The obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including (among other

•
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock
entitled to vote thereon (the “Company Stockholder Approval”);

(i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof whether by agreement or operation of law) applicable to the
consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act; and (ii) the Other Regulatory Approvals shall have been obtained and be in full force and

Financing of the Merger
(page 62)
There is no financing condition to the Merger. Regal Rexnord plans to fund the Merger Consideration with cash on hand and committed debt
financing, as described below.
In connection with the Merger, on October 26, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) pursuant to which JPMorgan (i) committed to provide Regal Rexnord with, among other things, a 364-day senior
unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion (the “Bridge Facility”) for the purpose of funding, in part, the Merger
Consideration, paying certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and related transactions and for general corporate purposes and (ii) agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange financing (through the issuance of notes and/or the incurrence of term loans) in an aggregate principal amount
of up to $5.5 billion for the purpose of replacing the Bridge Facility.
On March 28, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement providing for term loan credit facilities (the
“Term Loan Credit Facilities”) and a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Credit Facilities, the “Parent
Existing Credit Facility”). In connection with the Merger, on November 17, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to
the Parent Existing Credit Facility pursuant to which, among other things, the lenders party thereto agreed to provide $600 million of additional
commitments under the Term Loan Credit Facilities and $500 million of additional commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Merger was
permitted, the incurrence of debt in connection with the Merger was permitted and certain covenants were modified. Subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, the increased commitments under the Term Loan Credit Facilities will be available to fund, in part, the Merger Consideration, pay certain fees and
expenses related to the Merger and related transactions and for general corporate purposes.
On November 30, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement to the Parent Existing Credit Facility pursuant to which,
among other things, the lenders party thereto agreed to provide $240 million of additional commitments under the Term Loan Credit Facilities and $70
million of additional commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the increased commitments under the
Term Loan Credit Facilities will be available to fund, in part, the Merger Consideration, pay certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and related
transactions and for general corporate purposes.
The aggregate principal amount of the increased commitments under the Term Loan Credit Facilities have reduced on a dollar for dollar basis a
corresponding amount of the commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter. As a result, there are
now $4.66 billion in Bridge Facility commitments remaining.
Required Stockholder Approval
(page 26)
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the
Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement Proposal”). As of December 8, 2022 (the “Record Date”), 32,586,921 votes constitute a majority of the
outstanding shares of Altra common stock entitled to vote thereon. Approval of the proposal to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Altra’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Compensation Proposal”) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Altra common stock
properly cast for and
 
8
Table of Contents
against the Compensation Proposal. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”) (a) when a quorum is
present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Altra common stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, and (b)
when a quorum is not present, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Altra common stock representing a majority of the voting power
present at the Special Meeting. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (nonbinding) and is not a condition to the completion of the
Merger.
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 741,334 shares of Altra
common stock, representing approximately 1.1% of the shares of Altra common stock outstanding as of the Record Date.
We currently expect that each of our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of Altra common stock: (1) “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
The Special Meeting
(page 26)
Date, Time and Location
The Special Meeting to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be held virtually via live webcast on January 17,
2023, beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed). Altra stockholders will be able to virtually attend and
vote at the Special Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AIMC2023SM (the “Special Meeting website”). For purposes of attendance
at the Special Meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present” shall mean virtually present at the Special Meeting.
We encourage you to access the Special Meeting before it begins. Online check-in will start approximately 15 minutes before the Special Meeting is
scheduled to begin.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of Altra common stock at the close of business on the Record Date. Each Altra
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each such share owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 65,173,841 shares of Altra common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The presence,
in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Altra common stock entitled to vote on the Record Date, will constitute a
quorum at the Special Meeting.
Recommendation of the Altra Board of Directors
(page 41)
The Board has unanimously: (a) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (b) declared that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Altra and its stockholders; (c) directed that
the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Altra stockholders at the Special Meeting; and (d) resolved to recommend that
Altra stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3)
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Altra stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Takeover
Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”) or in connection with a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Restrictions on Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”).
However, the Board cannot make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement,
including negotiating with Parent in good faith over a three-business day period to amend or modify the Merger Agreement to obviate the need for such
Adverse Recommendation Change, after which the Board shall have determined, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that the
failure of the Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their duties
to the Company or its stockholders under applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement (a) by Parent in the event of (1) an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (2) the Company’s failure to recommend rejection of a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes a Takeover Proposal (as
defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; The Board’s
Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) within 10 business days after the commencement thereof, or (3) the Company’s failure to publicly
reaffirm its recommendation that Altra stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Board Recommendation”) within 10 business days following
receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation following the public announcement or disclosure of a Takeover Proposal or (b) by
Altra to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Proposal, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), will result in the payment by Altra of a
termination fee (the “Company Termination Fee”) of $100 million. Altra will also be required to pay the Company Termination Fee in additional
circumstances that involve a Takeover Proposal being made prior to certain terminations of the Merger Agreement and Altra subsequently consummating
a Takeover Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation
of Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) rendered its oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion that, as of October 26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $62.00 in cash per share of Altra
common stock (each, a “Share”) to be paid to the holders (other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 26, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services

recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between
the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of $45 million, $5 million of which became payable at
announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.

Interests of Altra’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
(page 55)
Altra’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Altra
stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger
Agreement and recommend that Altra stockholders vote their Altra common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests may include the
following:
 
•
(i) each outstanding Company Option, Company RSU and Company PSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled in
exchange for a cash payment, without interest, upon the Effective Time, (ii) each outstanding Company Option, Company RSU and
Company PSU that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted at the Effective Time into an unvested award
representing a number of shares of Parent common stock and (iii) each outstanding Company Restricted Share that is unvested immediately
prior to the completion of Merger will be converted at the Effective Time into an unvested award of restricted cash (as described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity-Based Awards”);
 
•
each of Messrs. Christenson, Deegan, Patriacca and Schuele is eligible to receive a retention award in the event that, despite mitigation
efforts, the applicable executive officer will receive “excess parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code)
(as of the date of this proxy statement, no determinations have been made as to whether any such individual will receive a retention
payment or the amounts of any such potential payments to any particular individual);
 
•
each of the Company’s named executive officers entered into a change in control agreement with the Company that provides for severance
and other benefits in the case of a “qualifying termination” prior to, on or following a change in control, which will include the completion of
the Merger (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Severance Entitlements”); and
 
•
the Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the Merger
Agreement.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” for additional information about these financial interests.

Under the Merger Agreement, Altra may not, directly or indirectly: (a) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) the making, submission or announcement of any Takeover Proposal or any proposal,
inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (b) make available any information regarding the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to any person (other than Parent and Parent’s or the Company’s representatives acting in their capacity as such) in connection with or in
response to a Takeover Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (c) engage in,

Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, if, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Altra stockholders Altra receives a Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a breach of the foregoing restrictions, Altra may furnish information pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (provided that within 24 hours Altra provides Parent any non-public information not previously provided to it), and engage in discussions or
negotiations with, a person in respect of a Takeover Proposal if in each case, subject to complying with certain procedures, the Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on
Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Altra stockholders, Altra is entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of
entering into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal if it pays the Company Termination Fee described below and complies with certain
procedures in the Merger Agreement, including (a) giving Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, (b)
during such three-business day period, negotiating with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to
the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal and (c) following the end of such three-business day period, the Board again determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisor) that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the proposed revisions in such binding offer were
to be given effect.
The termination of the Merger Agreement by Altra in connection with the Board’s authorization for Altra to enter into a definitive agreement to
effect a Superior Proposal will result in the payment by Altra of a termination fee of $100 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”.

Agreement by the other party; (d) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to October 26, 2023 (the “Outside Date”, except that (i) if the

Q: When and where is the Special Meeting?
A: The Special Meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via live webcast on January 17, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (unless the Special Meeting
is adjourned or postponed). There will not be a physical meeting location. In light of continuing public health and travel concerns arising from the
COVID-19 pandemic, Altra believes hosting a virtual meeting helps ensure the health and safety of its stockholders, the Board and Altra management.
Additionally, the virtual nature of the Special Meeting is generally designed to enable participation of and access by more Altra stockholders while
decreasing the cost of conducting the Special Meeting. Altra stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AIMC2023SM.
Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A: You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal;
 
•
to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
 
•
to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A: Altra stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of shares
of Altra common stock shall be entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the
close of business on the Record Date. Virtual attendance at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website is not required to vote.
Q: May I attend and vote at the Special Meeting?
A: All Altra stockholders as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the Special Meeting.
Shares held directly in your name as an Altra stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website. Shares
held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or
other nominee.
Even if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting at the Special Meeting”) so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or
become unable to virtually attend the Special Meeting. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, your vote will revoke any proxy previously
submitted.
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $62.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any
required tax withholding, for each share of Altra common stock that you own (other than Excluded Altra Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For example, if you own 100 shares of Altra common stock (other than Excluded Altra Shares), you will receive $6,200 in cash in exchange for your shares
of Altra common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
A: The exchange of Altra common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, for such purposes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this
 
14
Table of Contents
proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who
exchanges shares of Altra common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives pursuant to the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Altra common stock
surrendered by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger.
With respect to a non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Altra common stock for cash in the Merger generally will not result in
tax to that non-U.S. Holder under U.S. federal income tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder has certain connections with the United States, but may be
subject to backup withholding tax unless the non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption
from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This description does not
address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to
special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state, local
and non-U.S. tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Q: What will happen to outstanding Altra equity compensation awards in the Merger?
A: At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows:
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided that any such Company Option with an exercise price per share that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be converted into
an award of stock options to purchase a number of Parent common shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii)
the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per
share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted
Company Option will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and exercisability as were applicable to
the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a restricted stock unit
denominated in Parent common shares (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock
subject to such unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each
converted Company RSU will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting as were applicable to the
related Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (ii) an amount in cash equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend
equivalents;
 
15
Table of Contents
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such vested Company PSU
(assuming all applicable performance measures for vested Company PSUs are satisfied at the actual level of performance (measured as of
the Effective Time), as determined by the Board in consultation with Parent) and (y) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) an amount in cash
equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend equivalents);
 
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is unvested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into an award of time-based
restricted stock denominated in Parent common shares equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the sum of (x) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)(1) the
amount of any accrued unpaid dividend equivalents divided by (2) the Merger Consideration (assuming all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at (i) the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that
expires on or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of performance
(measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that is scheduled to expire after the Effective Time, in each case,
as determined by the Board in consultation with Parent) multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company
PSU will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting terms as were applicable to the applicable Company
PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the award will only be subject to time-based vesting conditions; and
 
•
each outstanding Company Restricted Share will be converted into a Restricted Cash Award equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Altra common stock subject to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Each Restricted Cash Award will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and forfeiture as were
applicable to the applicable Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the form of payment upon vesting
and settlement will be in cash.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity-Based
Awards”.
Q: How do Altra’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
A: As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 741,334 shares of
Altra common stock, representing approximately 1.1% of the shares of Altra common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. Although none of the
directors or executive officers is obligated to vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, we currently expect that
each of our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of Altra common stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
 
16
Table of Contents
Q: Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, my
interests as an Altra stockholder?
A: In considering the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting, you should be aware that Altra’s directors and executive officers have
financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Altra stockholders generally. The members of the Board were
aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend that Altra stockholders vote
their Altra common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests may include the following:
 
•
(i) each outstanding Company Option, Company RSU and Company PSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled in
exchange for a cash payment, without interest, upon the Effective Time, (ii) each outstanding Company Option, Company RSU and
Company PSU that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted at the Effective Time into an unvested award
representing a number of shares of Parent common stock and (iii) each outstanding Company Restricted Share that is unvested immediately
prior to the completion of Merger will be converted at the Effective Time into an unvested award of restricted cash (as described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity-Based Awards”);
 
•
each of Messrs. Christenson, Deegan, Patriacca and Schuele is eligible to receive a retention award in the event that, despite mitigation
efforts, the applicable executive officer will receive “excess parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code)
(as of the date of this proxy statement, no determinations have been made as to whether any such individual will receive a retention
payment or the amounts of any such potential payments to any particular individual);
 
•
each of the Company’s named executive officers entered into a change in control agreement with the Company that provides for severance
and other benefits in the case of a “qualifying termination” prior to, on or following a change in control, which will include the completion of
the Merger (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Severance Entitlements”); and
 
•
the Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the Merger
Agreement.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” for additional information about these financial interests.
Q: What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt
the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Altra common stock properly cast for and against the
Compensation Proposal is required to approve the Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of Altra common
stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, when a quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Altra
common stock representing a majority of the voting power present at the Special Meeting, when a quorum is not present, is required, as applicable, for
approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Altra stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over
the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at
the Special Meeting”); or (c) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement
 
17
Table of Contents
Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in
“street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each
“broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3)
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Altra stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Altra stockholders will not
receive any payment for their shares of Altra common stock. Instead, Altra will remain an independent public company, Altra common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and Altra will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under certain circumstances, Altra will be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $100 million and, under certain other circumstances,
Parent will be required to pay Altra a termination fee equal to $200 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”.
Q: Why are Altra stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A: The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Altra to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote with respect to certain payments
that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q: What will happen if Altra stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation
Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Altra. Therefore, if the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is
completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will be payable to Altra’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable agreements, regardless of whether the Compensation Proposal is approved.
Q: What do I need to do now?
A: You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement,
along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and
how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed
 
18
Table of Contents
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your shares can be voted at the Special
Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name”, please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote
your shares.
Q: Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder of book-entry shares in an amount
of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration, without interest, to which such holder is entitled, as described in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures”.
Q: If I hold my Altra common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of certificated shares whose shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each such
holder of Altra common stock will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such certificates, together with the associated
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent. You should not forward your stock certificates to the Paying Agent without a letter of transmittal, and you should not
return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures”.
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Altra common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If
you sell or transfer your shares of Altra common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Altra in writing
of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell
or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of
Altra common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or
grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting at the Special Meeting”).
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as an Altra stockholder of record and holding shares in “street name” as a beneficial owner?
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered to be
the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Altra.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of Altra common stock held in
“street name”. In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the Altra stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the virtual Special Meeting.

At the Special Meeting: Shares held directly in your name as an Altra stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the
Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you
obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
If your shares of Altra common stock are held “in street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee, the holder of your shares will provide you with
a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form and directions on how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote
over the Internet or by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. We
encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning
a proxy card by mail. You may still attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your
proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone
charges for which you will be responsible.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
Q: What is a proxy?
A: A proxy is an Altra stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such Altra stockholder on their behalf. If you are
an Altra stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in “street name”, you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: If an Altra stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the
way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or
 
20
Table of Contents
the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of
business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name”, will my broker vote my shares for me?
A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal.
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A: Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy statement. If you are the record
holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by any of the following actions:
 
•
You may vote again over the Internet or by telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the closing of the voting facilities at 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on January 16, 2023.
 
•
You may submit another properly signed proxy card with a later date, provided such proxy card is received no later than the close of
business on January 16, 2023.
 
•
You may send a signed written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Altra’s Secretary at 300 Granite Street, Suite 201, Braintree, MA
02184, provided such written notice is received no later than the close of business on January 16, 2023.
 
•
You may attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat. Simply attending the virtual Special Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you hold your shares of Altra common stock in “street name”, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding
how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website.
If you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:

Shareholders may call toll-free: 1 (877) 456-3513 
Banks and Brokers may call collect: 1 (212) 750-5833 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: This means you own shares of Altra common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you
may own some shares directly as an Altra stockholder of record and other shares through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker.
In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for
any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive
comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that
accompanies that proxy card.

Q: How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another Altra stockholder?
A: The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect
to two or more Altra stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those Altra stockholders. This process, which is
commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially provides extra convenience for Altra stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Altra and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple Altra stockholders who
request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected Altra stockholders. If at any time you no longer
wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these
documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage
account or Altra if you are an Altra stockholder of record by making a request to our Secretary at 300 Granite Street, Suite 201, Braintree, MA 02184 or by
calling (781) 917-0600. In addition, Altra will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of
the proxy statement.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A: The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In addition, within four business
days following certification of the final voting results, Altra will file the final voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not
yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A: Altra has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. Altra expects to pay Innisfree
M&A Incorporated a fee of $45,000, plus certain costs associated with additional services, as necessary, and Innisfree M&A Incorporated will be
reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Altra has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against various liabilities and
expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
Altra also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses in forwarding
proxy materials to beneficial owners of Altra common stock. Altra directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic
means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We currently expect to complete the Merger in the first half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted
because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are
outside of our control. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing
of the Merger”.
Q: How can I obtain additional information about Altra?
A: Altra will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders, including its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, without charge to any Altra stockholder who makes a request in writing or by
telephone to Altra’s Investor Relations Department at 300 Granite Street, Suite 201, Braintree, MA 02184 or (781) 917-0600.

The information contained in this proxy statement, together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by Altra, contains certain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Altra
intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions, which reflect Altra’s current
estimates, expectations and projections about Altra’s future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include,
among other things, the information concerning Altra’s possible future results of operations including revenue, costs of goods sold, gross margin, future
profitability, future economic improvement, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expected leverage levels, Altra’s competitive position and
the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industries in which we operate, Altra’s ability to consummate the Merger and other strategic
transactions on the expected timeline or at all and Altra’s expectations regarding the Special Meeting. Forward-looking statements include statements that
are not historical facts and can be identified by forward-looking words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “continue”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”,
“forecast”, “intend”, “plan”, “may”, “project”, “should”, “will”, “would”, and similar expressions or variations. These forward-looking statements are
based upon information currently available to Altra and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause Altra’s actual
results, performance, prospects, or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-
looking statements:
 
•
the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are
delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect Altra or the expected benefits of the Merger or that the
approval of Altra stockholders is not obtained;
 
•
the ability of Regal Rexnord to obtain debt financing in connection with the Merger;
 
•
the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived, including the
failure to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions
placed on such approvals);
 
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger, including in circumstances
which would require Altra to pay the Company Termination Fee;
 
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on Altra’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, its ability to maintain
relationships with its customers, suppliers, distributors and others with whom it does business, or its operating results and business
generally;
 
•
risks related to the Merger and related transactions diverting management’s attention from Altra’s ongoing business operations;
 
•
the risk that shareholder litigation in connection with the Merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; and
 
•
other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” and the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” sections of Altra’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 28,
2022, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on November 3, 2022 and risks
that may be described in Altra’s other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings by Altra with the SEC.
In addition to the risks described above, other unknown or unpredictable factors also could affect Altra’s results. As a result of these factors, we cannot
assure you that the forward-looking statements in this proxy statement will

prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant
uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that
we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this proxy statement represent our views

Only Altra stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. A list of Altra
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices located at 300 Granite Street, Suite 201, Braintree,
MA 02184, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting, as well as on the Special Meeting website. If
Altra’s headquarters are closed during such period for health and safety reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the list of Altra stockholders will be
made available for inspection upon request to our Secretary at 300 Granite Street, Suite 201, Braintree, MA 02184, subject to the satisfactory verification of
Altra stockholder status. The list will also be available electronically during the Special Meeting on the Special Meeting website. As of the Record Date,
there were 65,173,841 shares of Altra common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
The presence, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Altra common stock entitled to vote on the Record

Each Altra stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Altra common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to approve
the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, 32,586,921 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock.
Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Altra stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Altra common stock properly cast and against for the Compensation Proposal is
required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of Altra common stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, when a
quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Altra common stock representing a majority of the voting power present at
the Special Meeting, when a quorum is not present, is required, as applicable, for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
 
26Table of Contents
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, for Altra stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from
voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the Altra stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is
present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no
effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees
return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of
such shares. Altra does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only
provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
Special Meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Altra common stock at the Special Meeting
without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Agreement Proposal.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.

card that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation
Proposal on a nonbinding advisory basis, your shares of Altra common stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned

If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Altra
common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of
their shares of Altra common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Altra
common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to
receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262.
 
29Table of Contents
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Altra common stock following
petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Altra
common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly
with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the
complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before
attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Altra common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares through the
Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly
complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of
a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B)
provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct
copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be
set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal
Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Altra common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined
to be the fair value.

The Company’s management and the Board regularly review the Company’s performance and prospects in light of its business and developments
in the electromechanical power transmission motion control industry. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential
partnerships, collaborations and other strategic transactions and opportunities to enhance stockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such
reviews have been accompanied by periodic conversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in such
industry regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.
 
34Table of Contents
On March 11, 2022, during a Manufacturers Alliance CEO Council conference in Pentagon City, Virginia, Louis V. Pinkham, Chief Executive Officer
of Regal Rexnord, and Carl R. Christenson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, met and discussed the possibility of having dinner to
discuss their respective businesses.
On April 4, 2022, in light of the significant industry consolidation that had occurred during 2021, the Company’s strong position in the industry,
and the upcoming dinner with Regal Rexnord, Mr. Christenson contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs and asked that they attend the Company’s
next regularly scheduled Board meeting on April 25, 2022, and provide the Board with an overview of the market and key considerations if the Company
became the target of activism or an unsolicited offer.
On April 13, 2022, Mr. Pinkham and Mr. Christenson met for dinner, at the end of which Mr. Pinkham raised the possibility of a business
combination between the Company and Regal Rexnord. Mr. Pinkham and Mr. Christenson did not discuss a possible price or other terms. Mr. Christensen
indicated that he would take the matter back to the Board for review. Following the dinner, Mr. Christenson informed Lyle G. Ganske, the Company’s lead
independent director, of Regal Rexnord’s potential interest.
On April 25, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, met in person in
Blacksburg, VA. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of the market, strategic alternatives and key considerations in the context
of activism or an unsolicited offer. In an executive session attended by only the Board, Mr. Christenson informed the Board of Regal Rexnord’s potential
interest in a business combination with the Company and described his conversations with Mr. Pinkham to date. Following discussion, the Board
determined that a sale of the Company at that time was not in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders due to the fact that the Company’s
stock price was undervalued at that time relative to recent average trading prices as a result of the broad downturn in U.S. equity markets.
During the month of May, Mr. Christenson and Mr. Pinkham had three telephonic conversations during which Mr. Christenson and Mr. Pinkham
discussed the possibility of a proposal and the Board’s decision that a sale of the Company at that time was not in the best interest of the Company and
its stockholders.
On August 23, 2022, Mr. Pinkham emailed Mr. Christenson with a request for a call.
On August 26, 2022, Mr. Pinkham and Mr. Christenson spoke telephonically during which Mr. Pinkham asked to meet with Mr. Christenson and
indicated that he planned to provide Mr. Christenson with a written proposal to combine Regal Rexnord and the Company. Mr. Christenson promptly
informed Mr. Ganske and representatives of Goldman Sachs of these discussions and a meeting date was agreed.
On August 29, 2022, Mr. Pinkham met with Mr. Christenson and provided him with a Letter of Intent (the “Offer Letter”) containing a preliminary
non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding Company common stock at a price of $60.70 per share in cash (the “August 29
Proposal”), representing a 56.9% premium to the closing price for shares of Altra common stock of $38.69 on August 29, 2022, the last trading day prior to
the August 29 Proposal, and a 60.2% premium to the Company’s 90-day-volume-weighted average share price of $37.90 as of the same day. The Offer
Letter also stated that Regal Rexnord’s proposal had the support of its Board of Directors and management team, that Regal Rexnord had retained legal
and financial advisors, and that the acquisition would be funded by a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing, to be arranged by J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC on the terms set forth in a highly confident letter attached to the Offer Letter. Mr. Christenson told Mr. Pinkham that he would
discuss the August 29 Proposal with the Board but that the Company was currently not for sale, and any potential transaction would need to be at a
higher price, without the Company bearing meaningful consummation risk.
On September 1, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, Swaine &
Moore LLP (“Cravath”), outside counsel to the Company, met virtually
 
 
35
Table of Contents
to discuss the August 29 Proposal. Mr. Christenson provided the Board with an update regarding the August 29 Proposal, including a summary of the
interactions between Mr. Christenson and Mr. Pinkham to date and a review of views as to why Regal Rexnord was likely to be willing and able to pay a
higher price than any other potentially interested party, and discussed with the Board potential next steps to be taken by the Company in response to the
August 29 Proposal. A representative of Cravath reviewed with the Board their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in the context of the
August 29 Proposal, and representatives of Goldman Sachs provided the Board with a preliminary overview of the August 29 Proposal. The Board
scheduled a subsequent meeting for September 8, 2022 and requested that the Company’s management work with Goldman Sachs to perform a preliminary
financial analysis of the August 29 Proposal prior to such meeting.
On September 8, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, met
virtually. During this meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs presented its preliminary financial analysis of the August 29 Proposal based on pre-
existing financial projections provided by the Company’s management. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then discussed certain strategic
considerations, including the possibility of and considerations regarding conducting a “market check” to gauge third-party interest in an acquisition of
the Company. Following discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs, Cravath and the Company’s management, the Board determined that
contacting alternative bidders for the Company would not be in the best interest of Altra stockholders in light of the risks that a “market check” would
entail, including concerns that market leaks or rumors regarding a potential transaction could disrupt the Company’s business relationships, increase
employee turnover, increase turnover in the Company’s stockholder base and result in potential stock price volatility. The Board also considered the fact
that there were a limited number of potential counterparties that might have an interest in, and be financially capable of, engaging in a strategic
transaction with the Company at a value higher than Regal Rexnord’s offer, that the recent deterioration of the credit and equity markets threatened the
prospects of any transaction, including one with Regal Rexnord, and that guiding Regal Rexnord to make a “preemptive offer” (i.e., an offer on terms that
were sufficiently attractive that the Board would conclude that engaging in discussions on a bilateral basis with Regal Rexnord was in the best interest of
Altra stockholders) presented the best opportunity to maximize value for Altra stockholders. As a result, the Board determined that it was in the best
interest of the Company and its stockholders to engage with Regal Rexnord regarding a potential transaction, but that any definitive agreement must
provide for a high degree of closing certainty, contain a termination fee that would not deter competing bids and a “no-shop” provision that would permit
the Company to engage in negotiations with third parties regarding potentially superior proposals while under a binding contract with Regal Rexnord.
The Board then authorized the Company’s management to inform Regal Rexnord that the August 29 Proposal was insufficient and that improved terms
would be a condition to further discussions regarding a potential transaction but that, upon execution of a confidentiality agreement, the Company would
provide Regal Rexnord with limited high-level information to enable Regal Rexnord to improve its offer price.
Later on September 8, 2022, Mr. Christenson and Mr. Ganske informed Mr. Pinkham that the Board had determined that the August 29 Proposal was
insufficient from a financial perspective, but that, following the execution by Regal Rexnord of a customary confidentiality agreement, Mr. Christenson
and a limited number of other members of senior management of the Company would make themselves available for a meeting to help Regal Rexnord learn
about the Company in order to facilitate an increase in Regal Rexnord’s offer price. Mr. Christenson and Mr. Ganske also informed Mr. Pinkham that the
Board was not prepared to accept any meaningful consummation risk.
On September 9, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Cravath provided a draft confidentiality agreement to representatives of
Sidley Austin LLP, Regal Rexnord’s outside legal counsel (“Sidley”), which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of the
Company, Regal Rexnord, Cravath and Sidley, with particular focus on the duration and other terms of the standstill provision.
On September 10, 2022, at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal Rexnord’s financial advisors sent representatives of Goldman
Sachs an initial due diligence request list.
 
36
Table of Contents
On September 18, 2022, Mr. Christenson informed Mr. Pinkham that the Company was willing to agree to a six-month standstill in the confidentiality
agreement but reemphasized that the Company expected that, following further due diligence, Regal Rexnord would improve its offer price and that any
merger agreement would contain terms consistent with the Company’s position that it would not take any meaningful consummation risk. Mr. Pinkham
indicated he understood the Company’s position, and the confidentiality agreement was executed later that day.
On September 19, 2022, members of the Company’s management team, representatives of Goldman Sachs, members of Regal Rexnord’s management
team, and representatives of Regal Rexnord’s financial advisors met in person in Boston, and the Company’s management delivered a presentation on,
among other things, operational and management highlights, growth strategies, overviews of its financial performance and projections, and preliminary
views on potential synergies.
On September 20, 2022, at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal Rexnord’s financial advisors sent a supplemental due diligence
request list to representatives of Goldman Sachs. Over the course of the next several weeks, Regal Rexnord and its representatives conducted due
diligence on Altra, including by way of diligence calls and documentary review.
On September 21, 2022, representatives of the Company met virtually with representatives of Cravath to discuss Regal Rexnord’s supplemental due
diligence request list and the scope of non-public information that the Company was willing to provide prior to receipt of a revised offer. Later that day, at
the direction of the Company, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Regal Rexnord and its representatives with access to the Company’s virtual
data room in order to enable Regal Rexnord to improve its offer price. From time to time, representatives of the Company uploaded additional documents
to the Company’s virtual data room and representatives of Regal Rexnord reviewed these documents in the course of their due diligence.
On September 22, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of
Cravath, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, the in-person management meeting that had occurred on September 19 and updated financial
projections refined by the Company’s management, reflecting certain updates since the prior Board meeting on September 8. A letter from Goldman Sachs
regarding Goldman Sachs’ relationships with the Company and Regal Rexnord was then reviewed with the Board. A general update and discussion
regarding next steps followed. Following discussion, the Board determined that the Company would permit Regal Rexnord to conduct further due
diligence in order to enable it to improve its offer price and that Cravath would send a draft merger agreement to Sidley to be negotiated concurrently.
On September 23, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Sidley, which included, among other terms, a
“hell or high water” regulatory standard. The draft also included a right for Altra to terminate the Merger Agreement if it received an unsolicited
competing proposal financially superior to the Merger and Regal Rexnord declined to match such superior proposal after being offered an opportunity to
do so, subject to Altra paying a termination fee (a “company termination fee”) for an undetermined amount. The draft provided limited cooperation
obligations for Altra in connection with Regal Rexnord’s financing, but no marketing period for Regal Rexnord to obtain such financing.
On September 26, 2022, the Company held a financial diligence call with Regal Rexnord during which the updated 2022 financial projections were
shared.
On October 4, 2022, Mr. Pinkham spoke telephonically with Mr. Christenson to reaffirm Regal Rexnord’s previous non-binding proposal to acquire
100% of the outstanding equity of the Company at a price of $60.70 per share in cash (the “October 4 Proposal”), representing a 73.8% premium to the
closing price for shares of Altra common stock of $34.93 on October 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the October 4 Proposal. Later that day, the
October 4 Proposal was delivered to the Company in a letter, which requested that, in order to finalize a transaction efficiently and maintain strict
confidentiality, the Company enter into an exclusivity agreement
 
37
Table of Contents
providing for exclusivity until 11:59 p.m. Central Time on October 24, 2022, with an automatic one-week extension if negotiations continued in good faith.
Later that day, representatives of Sidley sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of Cravath that included, among other things, a
marketing period, a proposed company termination fee of 3.5% of transaction equity value and a revised position on regulatory commitments, such that
Regal Rexnord’s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would exclude
actions that relate to assets or businesses (of Regal Rexnord or the Company) that contributed to the generation of $100 million or more of revenue from
third-party sales in calendar year 2021.
On October 5, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, met
virtually to discuss the October 4 Proposal, the revised draft merger agreement and next steps. Management of the Company and representatives of
Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the Company’s interactions with Regal Rexnord since the prior Board meeting on September 22, 2022.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of the October 4 Proposal and macroeconomic developments, including in the credit
markets. Next, representatives of Cravath presented an overview of the key legal terms of the draft merger agreement proposed by Regal Rexnord.
Following discussion, the Board determined that the October 4 Proposal remained insufficient from a financial perspective and that certain of the
proposed terms of the revised merger agreement were unacceptable, including with respect to closing certainty, the restrictions on the ability of Altra to
engage in discussions with parties that submitted an unsolicited proposal after signing and the company termination fee. The Board then directed Mr.
Christenson, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath to inform Regal Rexnord and its representatives that the Company was willing to accept a
revised offer of $63.00 per share if Regal Rexnord agreed to bear all regulatory risk associated with the transaction and to improve certain other terms of
its offer.
Later that day, Mr. Christenson spoke telephonically with Mr. Pinkham to communicate that the Company was willing to accept a revised offer of
$63.00 per share if Regal Rexnord agreed to bear all regulatory risk associated with the transaction and improved certain other terms of its offer, including
the company termination fee and the terms of the “no shop” provision (the “October 5 Counterproposal”). Representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Cravath subsequently discussed the October 5 Counterproposal with representatives of Regal Rexnord’s financial advisors and Sidley, respectively,
during which discussion Cravath proposed a company termination fee of 1.75% of transaction equity value.
On October 6, 2022, Mr. Pinkham spoke telephonically with Mr. Christenson to deliver a revised non-binding proposal, which consisted of an offer
to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the Company at a price of $61.50 per share in cash, a company termination fee of 2.8% of transaction equity
value and a revised position on regulatory commitments, such that Regal Rexnord’s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain
regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would exclude actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s Power Transmission Technologies segment (the “October 6 Proposal”). The October 6
Proposal represented a 65.9% premium to the closing price for shares of Altra common stock of $37.07 on October 5, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
October 6 Proposal.
On October 7, 2022, the Company delivered a verbal counteroffer proposing an offer price of $62.25 per share, a company termination fee of 2.0% of
transaction equity value, a reverse termination fee, which would be payable by Regal Rexnord if certain specified regulatory-related closing conditions
were not met (a “reverse termination fee”), of 7.5% of transaction equity value and a revised position on regulatory commitments, such that Regal
Rexnord’s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would exclude those
actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Regal Rexnord and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the transaction.
Also, on October 7, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed representatives of Regal Rexnord’s financial advisors that Altra was
concerned that Regal Rexnord’s regulatory standard in the October 6 Proposal
 
38
Table of Contents
could allocate meaningful regulatory risk to Altra. In response, following discussions with and at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal
Rexnord’s financial advisors spoke telephonically with representatives of Goldman Sachs to deliver a revised proposal on regulatory commitments, such
that Regal Rexnord’s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would
exclude actions that relate to assets or businesses (of Regal Rexnord or the Company) that contributed to the generation of $200 million or more of
revenue from third-party sales in calendar year 2021, and otherwise reaffirm the October 6 Proposal, including a company termination fee of 2.8% of
transaction equity value. Representatives of Goldman Sachs promptly relayed information regarding the discussion to Mr. Christenson.
On October 8, 2022, Mr. Christenson, Mr. Ganske and representatives of Cravath discussed next steps in light of Regal Rexnord’s revised proposal,
including a range of potential counterproposals by the Company. Following such discussion, Mr. Christenson spoke with representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Cravath and instructed Cravath to convey the Company’s counterproposal to Sidley, as well as to discuss other key outstanding issues in the
draft merger agreement.
Later that day, representatives of Cravath and representatives of Sidley telephonically discussed certain unresolved business and legal issues.
Cravath conveyed that, if Regal Rexnord increased its offer to $62.25 per share and accepted a company termination fee of 2.0% of transaction equity
value and a reverse termination fee of 6.5% of transaction equity value, the Company would be willing to revise its position on regulatory commitments,
such that Regal Rexnord’s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction
would exclude those actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Regal
Rexnord and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the transaction (with Regal Rexnord deemed to be the same size as the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).
On October 9, 2022, at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal Rexnord’s financial advisors spoke telephonically with
representatives of Goldman Sachs to deliver a revised proposal consisting of an offer price of $61.50 per share, a company termination fee of 2.8% of
transaction equity value, a reverse termination fee of 4.5% of transaction equity value and the regulatory commitments position proposed by Cravath the
prior day (the “October 9 Proposal”). The October 9 Proposal represented a 75.9% premium to the closing price for shares of Altra common stock of
$34.96 on October 7, 2022, the last trading day prior to the October 9 Proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs promptly relayed information regarding
the discussion to Mr. Christenson.
Later that day, Mr. Christenson spoke telephonically with Mr. Pinkham to deliver a counterproposal (the “October 9 Counterproposal”) consisting
of an offer price of $62.00 per share, the Company Termination Fee of 2.5% of transaction equity value and the Parent Termination Fee of 5.0% of
transaction equity value, which Mr. Pinkham verbally accepted, on the condition that the Company grant Regal Rexnord exclusivity. The October 9
Counterproposal represented a 77.3% premium to the closing price for shares of Altra common stock of $34.96 on October 7, 2022, the last trading day
prior to the October 9 Counterproposal.
On October 11, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of Sidley, reflecting the terms of the
October 9 Counterproposal.
On October 12, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, met
virtually to discuss, among other things, the Company’s interactions with Regal Rexnord since the prior Board meeting on October 5, 2022, the terms of
the October 9 Counterproposal, the other significant open issues with the key legal terms in the draft merger agreement and next steps. Following
discussion, the Board authorized the Company’s management to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Regal Rexnord, with an exclusivity period
ending no later than 11:59 Central Time on October 24, 2022, and directed the Company’s management, with the assistance of Cravath, to negotiate the
outstanding points in the merger agreement.

Table of Contents
On October 17, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement with Regal Rexnord providing for exclusive negotiations until 11:59 p.m.
Central Time on October 24, 2022. Additionally, representatives of Sidley sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of Cravath, which
contained terms consistent with the October 9 Counterproposal but required further negotiation in certain areas.
On October 20, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent representatives of Sidley a draft proposal regarding certain employee retention, compensation
and benefits-related matters.
Between October 20, 2022 and October 26, 2022, Altra, Regal Rexnord, Cravath and Sidley worked to finalize the merger agreement, including the
specific language of Regal Rexnord’s regulatory efforts obligations, the circumstances under which the Board would be permitted to change its
recommendation to Altra stockholders and terminate the merger agreement, the circumstances under which the Company Termination Fee and the Parent
Termination Fee would be payable, the initiation and duration of the marketing period, the treatment of unvested equity awards in connection with the
transaction and certain other employee retention, compensation and benefits-related matters, with several drafts exchanged over this period.
On October 25, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, met
virtually. A letter from Goldman Sachs regarding Goldman Sachs’ relationships with the Company and Regal Rexnord was reviewed with the Board, and
the Board approved the formal engagement terms for Goldman Sachs as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with its review of a potential
transaction. Next, representatives of Goldman Sachs presented its preliminary financial analysis of the Merger Consideration based on updated financial
projections refined by the Company’s management (as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Certain Financial Forecasts”).
Discussion followed, including regarding the lack of potential counterparties that might have an interest in, and be financially capable of, engaging in a
strategic transaction with the Company at a value higher than Regal Rexnord’s offer and the Board’s belief that the proposed transaction with Regal
Rexnord continued to present the best opportunity to maximize value for Altra stockholders. Representatives of Cravath reviewed the Board’s fiduciary
duties in connection with its consideration of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Cravath then provided an overview of the terms of the
proposed merger agreement, with a particular focus on the definition of Material Adverse Effect, Regal Rexnord’s obligations regarding regulatory
commitments, the circumstances under which the Company Termination Fee would be payable, the “no-shop” provision, the initiation and duration of the
marketing period and the parties’ respective proposals regarding certain employee retention, compensation and benefits-related matters, including the
treatment of unvested equity awards. Following discussion, the Board directed the Company’s management, with the assistance of Cravath, to finalize the
merger agreement with Regal Rexnord and its representatives.
On October 26, 2022, representatives of Cravath and Sidley finalized the merger agreement.
Later that day, the Board reconvened to review the proposed transaction with Regal Rexnord. A representative of Goldman Sachs rendered
Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board that, as of October 26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
$62.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders. For additional information regarding Goldman Sachs’ opinion, please see the section of this proxy statement
below entitled “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs”. The written opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board the proposed merger agreement, including the mutually agreed terms regarding certain employee
retention, compensation and benefits-related matters. Following additional discussion and consideration of the proposed merger agreement, the Board
recessed and the Compensation Committee of the Board convened and unanimously approved certain employment compensation and other employee
benefit arrangements with respect to the employees of the Company in connection with the proposed merger agreement, including the treatment of
Company equity awards. Following such approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board, the Board reconvened and unanimously (i) authorized
and approved the execution, delivery and

performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Altra and its stockholders, (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Altra stockholders at
the Special Meeting and (iv) recommended that Altra stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
Following the conclusion of the Board meeting, the parties executed and delivered the Merger Agreement on October 26, 2022.
On October 27, 2022, at 6:30 a.m., Eastern Time, prior to the opening of trading on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, the parties issued
separate press releases announcing the transaction.

Recommendation of the Board
The Board has unanimously: (a) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (b) declared that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Altra and its stockholders; (c) directed that
the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Altra stockholders at the Special Meeting; and (d) resolved to recommend that
Altra stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal;
and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
As described above in the section entitled “—Background of the Merger”, prior to and in reaching its unanimous determination to authorize and
approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and stockholders of the Company and recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the
Board consulted with and received the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company’s management and
considered a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including,
among other things, the following non-exhaustive list of material factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
 
•
Merger Consideration; Premium to the Trading Price of Altra Common Stock. The Board considered the current and historical market
prices of Altra common stock, including the market performance of Altra common stock relative to those of other participants in the
Company’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $62.00 per share of Altra common stock
represented a:
 
•
57% premium to the trading price at which Altra common stock closed on October 25, 2022, the last trading day prior to the Board’s
approval of the Merger;
 
•
73% premium to the volume weighted average price for Altra common stock over the 30-trading day period ended October 25, 2022,
the last trading day that closed prior to the Board’s approval of the Merger; and
 
•
0.4% premium to the highest closing price in the 52-week period ended October 25, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to the
Board’s approval of the Merger.
 
41Table of Contents
•
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which will provide Altra
stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Altra common stock, enables Altra stockholders to realize value
that has been created by Altra and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions, as
compared to Altra remaining independent.
 
•
No Financing Condition and Committed Debt Financing. The Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to a financing
condition, that Regal Rexnord obtained committed debt financing for the Merger from a reputable financing source and that Regal Rexnord
and Merger Sub have represented in the Merger Agreement that proceeds from such financing will, in the aggregate and together with any
cash or other funds available to Regal Rexnord or Merger Sub, be sufficient to pay the amounts required to be paid in connection with, or as
a result of, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
•
Lack of Potential Counterparties. The Board considered the fact that there were a limited number of potential counterparties that might
have an interest in, and be financially capable of, engaging in a strategic transaction with Altra at a value higher than Regal Rexnord’s offer
and the potential regulatory, commercial and financing issues that might arise in connection with pursuing such a transaction. For a detailed
discussion of the Board’s assessment of potential counterparties, please see above under the heading entitled “—Background of the
Merger”.
 
•
Risk Associated with a “Market Check”. The Board considered the fact that contacting other potential counterparties prior to signing a
definitive agreement with Regal Rexnord would result in significant risks to the Company and its business, including concerns that market
leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the Company’s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well
as lead to turnover in the Company’s stockholder base and potential stock price volatility, and concerns that Regal Rexnord could withdraw
from consideration of a potential transaction if Altra were to pursue other potential counterparties, including as a result of a downturn in the
credit markets. For a detailed discussion of the Board’s consideration of a “market check”, please see above under the heading entitled
“—Background of the Merger”.
 
•
The Company’s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Board considered the Company’s operating and financial
performance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company’s senior management,
which reflect an application of various assumptions of senior management. The Board considered the inherent uncertainty of achieving
senior management’s prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading entitled “—Certain Financial Forecasts”, and that as a result
the Company’s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially from senior management’s forecasts.
 
•
Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. After a review of a range of alternatives and discussions with management and the
Company’s financial and legal advisors, the Board determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company than the potential value that might result from other options available, including, but not limited to, remaining a standalone public
company. As part of these evaluations, the Board considered an assessment of the Company’s business, assets, prospects, competitive
position, historical and projected financial performance, short- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in which the
Company competes as well as the significant risks and uncertainties associated with remaining a standalone public company.
 
•
Goldman Sachs’ Fairness Opinion and Related Financial Analyses. Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of October
26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $62.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders
(other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
holders. For a detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs’ opinion, please see below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Opinion of
Goldman Sachs”. The written opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
 
42
Table of Contents
•
Negotiation Process. The Board considered its belief that, after extensive negotiations, the Company obtained the highest price that Regal
Rexnord is willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company’s ability to increase the Merger Consideration relative to Regal
Rexnord’s initial offer of $60.70 per share of Altra common stock. The Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger were the result
of robust arm’s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge of and at the direction of the Board, with the
assistance of experienced financial and legal advisors. For a detailed discussion of the negotiation process, please see above under the
heading entitled “—Background of the Merger”.
 
•
Timing of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger and concluded that, despite the
number of regulatory approvals required in connection with the Merger, the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals
Required for the Merger”. The Board also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the
period during which Altra’s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
 
•
Business Reputation of Regal Rexnord. The Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Regal Rexnord and its
management and the financial resources of Regal Rexnord, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Regal
Rexnord could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner.
 
•
No Vote of Regal Rexnord Stockholders. The Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to the conditionality and execution
risk of any required approval by Regal Rexnord’s shareholders.
 
•
Regulatory Matters. The Board considered the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement Regal Rexnord would be required to take
all actions to secure the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as well as to obtain the Other Regulatory
Approvals, except that Regal Rexnord would not be required to take, proffer to, agree to, commit to, accept, or consent to, any Remedial
Action if such Remedial Action, individually or together with other Remedial Actions, would or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Regal Rexnord and its subsidiaries (including the
Company and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger but without giving effect to any Remedial Actions (with
Regal Rexnord and its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole, measured for this purpose as being the
same size and having the same financial position and results of operations as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to
giving effect to the Merger and prior to giving effect to any Remedial Actions). For a detailed discussion of regulatory matters, please see
below under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Consummate the Merger”.
 
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
 
•
that the Company may, subject to certain conditions, furnish, pursuant to entry into an acceptable confidentiality agreement,
confidential information with respect to the Company to third parties making an unsolicited proposal and participate in discussions or
negotiations with such third parties regarding unsolicited proposals that are made prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the
Merger;
 
•
the provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement prior
to obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event,
subject to Regal Rexnord’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of the Company Termination Fee of $100
million;
 
43
Table of Contents
•
the provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions
(including payment of the Company Termination Fee and certain rights of Regal Rexnord to match the Superior Proposal);
 
•
the Board’s belief, after discussion with Altra’s advisors, that the Company Termination Fee, which constitutes approximately 2.5% of
Altra’s equity value in the Merger, would not preclude a Superior Proposal from being made; and
 
•
the Parent Termination Fee of $200 million that may be owed by Regal Rexnord to the Company in connection with the termination of
the Merger Agreement under specified regulatory related circumstances.
For a detailed discussion of the Merger Agreement, please see below under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement”.
 
•
Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Altra stockholders who comply with all of
the required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, including the fact that such
stockholders will have the right to demand appraisal and payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery. For a detailed discussion of appraisal rights, please see below under the section entitled “—Appraisal Rights”.
 
•
Specific Performance. Altra’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of Regal
Rexnord’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other breaches of the Merger Agreement.
 
•
Opportunity for Altra Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the approval of Altra
stockholders, and Altra stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at
the Special Meeting.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the Merger Agreement and
the Merger, including the following material factors:
 
•
No Participation in Altra’s Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that if the Merger is consummated, stockholders of the
Company will receive the Merger Consideration in cash and will no longer have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or
growth of the Company or the combined company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of Altra common stock,
including any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other transactions.
 
•
Closing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to
consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Altra stockholders.
 
•
Disruption of the Company’s Business. The Board considered the effect of a public announcement of the Merger on the Company’s
operations, stock price and employees and its ability to attract and retain management, sales and other personnel while the Merger is
pending and the potential adverse effects on the financial and other results of the Company as a result of that disruption.
 
•
Non-Solicitation Covenant. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the Company’s solicitation of
acquisition proposals from third parties and requires the Company to provide Regal Rexnord with an opportunity to propose in writing a
binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement prior to the Company being able to terminate the Merger Agreement
and accept a Superior Proposal, although the Board believes this would not preclude another potential acquiror from submitting a proposal
to acquire the Company.
 
•
Company Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that the Company must pay Regal Rexnord the Company Termination Fee of
$100 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain
 
44
Table of Contents
circumstances, including to accept a Superior Proposal, and that the amount of the Company Termination Fee is lower than termination fees
in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be paid unless the
Company entered into a more favorable transaction. The Board also recognized that the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to the
Company Termination Fee were insisted upon by Regal Rexnord as a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement.
 
•
Interim Operating Covenants. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s
business prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its and its
subsidiaries’ business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger (as more fully described under the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger”).
 
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the Merger might not be
consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:
 
•
Altra’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced
significant distraction from their work during the pendency of the Merger;
 
•
Altra will have incurred significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the Merger,
many of which will be payable even if the Merger is not completed;
 
•
Altra’s continuing business relationships with personnel, customers, distributors, suppliers and other business parties may be
adversely affected;
 
•
the trading price of shares of Altra common stock will change to the extent that the current price reflects assumptions regarding the
completion of the Merger;
 
•
the market’s perceptions of Altra’s prospects could be adversely affected, which may lead to subsequent offers to acquire the
Company at a lower price or otherwise on less favorable terms to Altra and its stockholders than contemplated by the Merger; and
 
•
Altra could lose senior management or other personnel during the pendency of the Merger.
 
•
Regulatory Matters. The Board considered the regulatory approvals that would be required to consummate the Merger, the prospects for
receiving such approvals and the possibility that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure to obtain
such approvals.
 
•
Potential Future Share Price. The possibility that, although the Merger provides the Company’s stockholders the opportunity to realize a
premium to the price at which Altra common stock traded prior to the Board’s approval of the Merger, the price of Altra common stock might
have increased in the future to a price greater than the Merger Consideration.
 
•
Timing Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including that completion of the Merger
depends on factors outside of Altra’s or Regal Rexnord’s control (including the approval of the Merger by Altra stockholders and certain
governmental authorities) and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the
execution of the Merger Agreement could divert Altra management’s attention and have an adverse impact on Altra, including its customer,
distributor, supplier and other business relationships.
 
•
Litigation Risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger.
 
45
Table of Contents
•
Tax Treatment. The Board considered that the receipt of the Merger Consideration payable in the Merger will generally be taxable to
stockholders of the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. The Board believed that this was mitigated by the fact that the
entire consideration payable in the Merger would be cash, providing adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.
 
•
Other Risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the Merger and the business of the Company, as more fully
described below in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
The Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits
of the Merger.
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also considered that some of Altra’s directors and executive officers have
interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Altra stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered
them at the time it approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to Altra stockholders. For more information, please see the section of
this proxy statement entitled “—Interests of Altra’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”. The foregoing discussion of the information and
factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board. In
view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have
given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or
any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its unanimous recommendation on the
totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information
presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.

Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion that, as of October 26,
2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $62.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than
Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Company, which, together with the Amortization Forecasts (as defined below), are referred to as the Management Forecasts (as defined
below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Certain Financial Forecasts”); and
 
•
certain projected tax savings from amortization expense for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use
by the Company, which are included in the Management Forecasts (the “Amortization Forecasts”).
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current
business operations, financial condition, and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared
certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly
traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the motion control industry and in other industries; and performed such
other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company’s consent that the Management Forecasts
and the Amortization Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management
of the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or
other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be
obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that
the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of
which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business
combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view,
as of the date of the opinion, of the $62.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to
the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement
or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in
connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Altra, or class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $62.00 in
cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of
the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances,
developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Regal Rexnord or the Merger, or as to the

impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Regal Rexnord or the ability of the Company or Regal Rexnord to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection with rendering the opinion
described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,
nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of
the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone
not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is
based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before October 25, 2022, the second to last trading day before the public announcement
of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the $62.00 in cash
per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by $62.00 in cash per Share relative to:
 
•
$39.48, the closing price for the Shares on October 25, 2022, the second to last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger
(the “Undisturbed Share Price”);
 
•
$61.76, the highest closing trading price of the Shares over the 52-week period ended October 25, 2022 (the “52-Week High”);
 
•
$50.34, the median of the Wall Street research analyst price targets for the Shares as of October 25, 2022 (the “Median Analyst Price
Target”);
 
•
$35.78, the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Shares over the 30-trading-day period ended October 25, 2022 (the “30-Day
VWAP”);
 
•
$38.05, the VWAP of the Shares over the 60-trading-day period ended October 25, 2022 (the “60-Day VWAP”); and
 
•
$37.14, the VWAP of the Shares over the 90-trading-day period ended October 25, 2022 (the “90-Day VWAP”).

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Management Forecasts and the Amortization Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an
illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company. Using discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 11.0%, reflecting estimates of the Company’s
weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of September 30, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the
Company for Q4 2022 and the years 2023 through 2026 as reflected in the Management Forecasts (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the
Company, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth
 
48
Table of Contents
rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the Company, as reflected in the
Management Forecasts (which analysis implied exit terminal year EBITDA multiples ranging from 8.0x to 10.5x), and (iii) expected tax savings from future
amortization expense for the years 2027 through 2045 as reflected in the Amortization Forecasts. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by
application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital
structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal tax rate and a beta for the
company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by
Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Management Forecasts and market expectations regarding
long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the adjusted net debt and tax-effected underfunded
pension liability of the Company as of September 30, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company to
derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by fully diluted
outstanding Shares as of September 30, 2022, calculated using the treasury stock method using information provided by and approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by the management of the Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $48 to $64 per Share, rounded to the
nearest dollar.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an
illustrative future value per Share, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of the Company’s equity as
a function of the Company’s next twelve months (“NTM”) EV/EBITDA multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Management Forecasts for
each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values of the Company as of December 31 for each of
the fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025 by applying NTM EV/EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 11.0x to estimates of the Company’s forward adjusted EBITDA
(excluding stock-based compensation expenses) for each of the fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, based on the Management Forecasts.
These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and
historical NTM EV/EBITDA multiples for the Company. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the Company’s illustrative enterprise value the Company’s
forecasted adjusted net debt as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of the Company, to derive a range of implied equity
values for the Company for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the projected year-end fully diluted
outstanding Shares, calculated using the treasury stock method based on information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of the Company, to derive a range of implied future Share prices excluding dividends. Goldman Sachs then discounted the resulting implied
future Share prices excluding dividends for December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025 to present value as of September 30, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate
of 12.6%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires
certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs then assessed the forecasted number of cumulative dividends per Share, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of the Company, and discounted to present value the amount of such dividends using the above mentioned 12.6% discount rate. Goldman
Sachs added this amount to the present value of future share price excluding dividends to arrive at a range of implied present values of $42 to $64 per
Share, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Selected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the motion control
industry since 2013.
 
49
Table of Contents
For each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied EV/LTM
EBITDA multiple of the applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company’s LTM
EBITDA based on publicly available information at the time each selected transaction was announced. While none of the target companies that
participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Company, the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are
companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company’s results, market size and product
profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various transactions and its professional judgment,
Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples of 6.9x to 16.7x to the Company’s LTM EBITDA for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then
subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the Company’s net debt as of September 30, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs divided the results by
fully diluted outstanding Shares as of September 30, 2022, calculated using the treasury stock method based on information provided by and approved
for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of implied values per Company share of $25 to $79, rounded to the nearest
dollar.
Premia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition
transactions announced between January 1, 2012 and October 25, 2022 involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the
disclosed enterprise values for the transactions were between $1 billion and $10 billion. This analysis excluded transactions in the real estate industry and
financial institutions industry, and transactions with premia greater than 100% or less than 0% relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing price prior
to announcement, using information from FactSet. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th
percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the 406 transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing
 
50
Table of Contents
stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 30% across the period. This analysis also indicated a
25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 50% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of
illustrative premia of 19% to 50% to the Undisturbed Share Price of $39.48 as of October 25, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per Share
of $47 to $59, rounded to the nearest dollar.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to the Company, Regal Rexnord or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board that, as of the date of the opinion, the
$62.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of such Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being
based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, Regal Rexnord, Goldman
Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Regal Rexnord and was approved by the
Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of
consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its
determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman
Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any
time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments of the Company, Regal Rexnord, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may
be involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in connection with the Merger, the principal portion of which is contingent
upon consummation of the Merger, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Goldman Sachs’ expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs
against certain liabilities that may arise, out of its engagement. During the two-year period ended October 26, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of
Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by the Company or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs
has recognized compensation. During the two-year period ended October 26, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been
 
51
Table of Contents
engaged by Regal Rexnord or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation.
Goldman Sachs may in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Regal Rexnord and their respective affiliates
for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated October 24, 2022, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of $45
million, $5 million of which became payable at announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.
In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to
indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.",54,60

Other than annual guidance – including the guidance included in the Company’s press release dated February 16, 2022, and the updates of such
guidance in the Company’s press releases dated April 28, 2022 and July 28, 2022 (the “2022 earnings guidance”), with respect to sales, adjusted EBITDA,
diluted EPS, capital expenditures, free cash flow and certain other performance measures, which guidance the Company presents as a range – the
Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future performance, or results of operations, earnings or
other results, due to, among other things, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. In September 2022, in connection with the
evaluation of a proposed transaction, at the direction of the Board, senior management of the Company provided Goldman Sachs with certain preliminary
non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. Over the course of the next several weeks, in the context of
evaluating the proposal from Regal Rexnord, Altra senior management updated such preliminary non-public, unaudited prospective financial information
to take into account certain adjustments relating to, among other things, foreign exchange rate changes, surcharge revenues and the evolving
macroeconomic environment (the “Management Forecasts”).
Altra is including a summary of the Management Forecasts to provide Altra stockholders with access to information that was made available to the
Board in connection with its evaluation of, and Regal Rexnord in connection with discussions regarding, the Merger and the Merger Consideration.
The Board reviewed the Management Forecasts and, following discussions with Altra management, the Board authorized Goldman Sachs to use
the Management Forecasts, or a subset thereof, for purposes of its financial analyses and fairness opinion summarized in the sections of this proxy
statement entitled “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs”. Management of the Company modeled the Management Forecasts based on its reasonable best
estimates and assumptions with respect to the future financial performance of the Company on a standalone basis. The Management Forecasts were
based upon certain financial, operating and commercial assumptions developed solely using the information available to management of the Company at
the time the Management Forecasts were created.
The following tables summarize the Management Forecasts, as described above:

Important Information Concerning the Management Forecasts
The Management Forecasts were prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and were provided to the Board for the purposes of
Altra’s strategic review process. The Management Forecasts were also provided to and used by Goldman Sachs, Altra’s financial advisor, for the purpose
of performing financial analyses in connection with the strategic review process and for the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the Merger
Consideration from a financial point of view.
The summary of the Management Forecasts is included in this proxy statement solely to give Altra stockholders access to certain financial
forecasts that were made available to the Board, Goldman Sachs and Regal Rexnord and is not being included in this proxy statement to influence an Altra
stockholder’s decision whether to vote for the Merger Agreement Proposal or for any other purpose.
The Management Forecasts were generated solely for internal use and not developed with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial data, published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements or GAAP, but, in the view of Altra management, were reasonably
prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of
preparation. No independent registered public accounting firm provided any assistance in preparing the Management Forecasts. Accordingly, no
independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the Management Forecasts
or expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto, and they assume no responsibility for the information contained in
the Management Forecasts. The Deloitte & Touche LLP report included in Altra’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2021 relates solely to the historical financial information of Altra and to an assessment of Altra’s internal controls over financial reporting. Such reports
do not extend to the Management Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The inclusion of the Management Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that Altra, Regal Rexnord, their affiliates or financial advisors
or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of
 
53
Table of Contents
this information considered, or now considers, the Management Forecasts to be necessarily predictive of future results. There can be no assurance that
the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether or not the Merger is completed.
None of Altra, Parent or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will
not differ from the Management Forecasts, and, except as required by applicable law, none of Altra, Parent or their respective affiliates undertakes any
obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Management Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Management
Forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Management
Forecasts are shown to be inappropriate. None of Altra or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any
representation to any Altra stockholder or other person regarding the information included in the Management Forecasts or Altra’s ultimate performance
compared to the information contained in the Management Forecasts or that forecasted results will be achieved. Altra has made no representation to
Parent, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Management Forecasts. The Management Forecasts are forward-looking statements. The
assumptions and estimates underlying the Management Forecasts, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Altra,
may not be realized. Neither Altra nor any of its affiliates assumes any responsibility to holders of shares of Altra common stock for the accuracy of this
information. In particular, the Management Forecasts, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily, were based on numerous variables and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the Management Forecasts. Because the Management Forecasts
cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each
circumstance that will have an effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Important factors that may affect actual
results and result in the Management Forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to: the Company’s ability to invest in new technologies
and manufacturing techniques and to develop or adapt to changing technology and manufacturing techniques, international operations, including
currency risks, the accuracy of estimated forecasts of OEM customers, the scope and duration of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on global
economic systems, our employees, sites, operations, customers, and supply chain, including the impact of the pandemic on manufacturing and supply
capabilities throughout the world, disruption of our supply chain including the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage, the Company’s ability
to achieve its business plans, including with respect to an uncertain economic environment, the Company’s ability to recruit, retain and motivate key
sales, marketing or engineering personnel, the Company’s ability to obtain or protect intellectual property rights and avoid infringing on the intellectual
property rights of others, changes in labor or employment laws, environmental laws and regulations and the Company’s failure to comply with such laws
and other risk factors described in Altra’s SEC filings, including Altra’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on
Form 8-K, and described under the section above entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”. The Management Forecasts also
reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
Some or all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Management Forecasts may have changed since the date the Management Forecasts
were prepared. The information set forth in the Management Forecasts is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future
results, and the Management Forecasts may differ in important respects from the 2022 earnings guidance, which the Company’s management prepared
based on a different set of assumptions. The Management Forecasts were developed on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger, and
therefore the Management Forecasts do not give effect to the Merger or any changes to Altra’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the
consummation of the Merger, including cost synergies realized as a result of the Merger, or to any costs incurred in connection with the Merger.
Furthermore, the Management Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed and should not be viewed as
accurate or continuing in that context.

Table of Contents
The Management Forecasts contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Altra management believes are helpful in understanding Altra’s
past financial performance and future results. Altra management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for
comparing the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Altra believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding of its
underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and its peers and that these measures provide important
supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Altra’s financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows as well as insight into the compliance with its debt covenants, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP
financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of Altra’s competitors and
may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Altra’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC
rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial
measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure
is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Board or
Altra’s financial advisor in connection with their respective evaluations of the Merger. Accordingly, Altra has not provided a reconciliation of the non-
GAAP financial measures included in the Management Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The Management Forecasts summarized in this section were prepared prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and have not been updated
to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND, AND UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION, TO UPDATE
OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE MANAGEMENT FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION OR TO
REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE
PROJECTIONS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts,
readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Management Forecasts.

Altra’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Altra
stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger
Agreement and recommend that Altra stockholders vote their Altra common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Treatment of Company Equity-Based Awards
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows:
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided that any such Company Option with an exercise price per share that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be converted into
an award of stock options to purchase a number of Parent common shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the
number of shares of Altra
 
55Table of Contents
common stock subject to such unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per share of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company
Option will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and exercisability as were applicable to the
related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a restricted stock unit
denominated in Parent common shares (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock
subject to such unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each
converted Company RSU will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting as were applicable to the
related Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (ii) an amount in cash equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend
equivalents;
 
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such vested Company PSU
(assuming all applicable performance measures for vested Company PSUs are satisfied at the actual level of performance (measured as of
the Effective Time), as determined by the Board in consultation with Parent) and (y) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) an amount in cash
equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend equivalents);
 
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is unvested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into an award of time-based
restricted stock denominated in Parent common shares equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the sum of (x) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)(1) the
amount of any accrued unpaid dividend equivalents divided by (2) the Merger Consideration (assuming all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at (i) the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that
expires on or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of performance
(measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that is scheduled to expire after the Effective Time, in each case,
as determined by the Board in consultation with Parent) multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company
PSU will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting terms as were applicable to the applicable Company
PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the award will only be subject to time-based vesting conditions; and
 
•
each outstanding Company Restricted Share will be converted into a Restricted Cash Award equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Altra common stock subject to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Each Restricted Cash Award will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and forfeiture as were
applicable to the applicable Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the form of payment upon vesting
and settlement will be in cash.
The Company’s outstanding equity awards currently provide that awards will accelerate upon an award holder’s termination of employment
without “cause” or resignation for “good reason”, in each case, within two
 
56
Table of Contents
years following a change in control. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company will amend the terms of the outstanding equity-based
awards to provide that such awards will vest upon an award holder’s termination of employment without “cause” within three (rather than two) years
following the Effective Time. In addition, equity-based awards granted after the date of the Merger Agreement, and prior to the Effective Time, will
provide that such awards will accelerate upon an award holder’s (x) termination of employment without “cause” or (y) resignation for “good reason”,
except that with respect to clause (x), such provision will apply for three years following the Effective Time and clause (y) will only be applicable during
the two-year period following the Effective Time.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is permitted, upon the Effective Time, to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding and
unvested equity awards held by each of Messrs. Christenson, Deegan, Patriacca and Schuele.
The following table sets forth the number of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of the Company’s directors and
executive officers as of November 17, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and the cash
amounts payable (on a pre-tax basis) in respect thereof. The amounts reflected in the table below exclude any grants that may be made following
November 17, 2022 and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance with their terms
prior to December 31, 2022 (the assumed date of the completion of the Merger solely for purposes of this transaction-related compensation disclosure).
Company Options are valued based on the difference between the per-share exercise price of such Company Option and the Merger Consideration of
$62.00 per share. As a result, any Company Option included in the table below that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration does not have any value for purposes of the table below. Company RSUs and Company PSUs are valued based on the Merger
Consideration of $62.00 per share and, in the case of Company PSUs, based on the assumed level of performance described below. Payments in respect of
all Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by Messrs. Christenson, Deegan, Patriacca and Schuele are “double-trigger” in that they
will be paid only if the holder experiences a “qualifying termination” of employment prior to or following the Effective Time, or if the awards otherwise
vest in accordance with their terms.

Under the Merger Agreement, upon the Effective Time, vested Company PSUs will be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash
(assuming all applicable performance measures are satisfied at the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time)) plus an amount
equal to accumulated and unpaid dividend equivalents. The number of Company PSUs shown assumes that Company PSUs granted in 2020 have
been earned at the maximum level (i.e., 150%). Such assumptions were made based on the
 
57
Table of Contents
Company’s latest performance estimates for the applicable performance measures, as of November 17, 2022.
2
Under the Merger Agreement, upon the Effective Time, unvested Company PSUs will be canceled and converted into an award of time-based
restricted stock denominated in Parent common shares equal to the product of (i) the sum of (x) the number of Company common shares subject to
the unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) plus the amount of any accrued unpaid dividend equivalents divided by
(2) the Merger Consideration (assuming all applicable performance measures are satisfied at (a) the actual level of performance (measured as of the
Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that expires on or prior to the Effective Time and (b) the greater of (x) the target level of
performance and (y) the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time) with respect to any performance period that is scheduled to
expire after the Effective Time). The number of Company PSUs shown assumes that (1) Company PSUs granted in 2021 have been earned at
115.78% and (2) Company PSUs granted in 2020 and 2022 have been earned at 150% (the maximum level). Such assumptions were made based on
the Company’s latest performance estimates for the applicable performance measures, as of November 17, 2022.

Mr. Storch retired from the Company effective as of January 31, 2022. As an authorized retiree, Mr. Storch’s equity awards remain outstanding and,
following the Effective Time, Mr. Storch’s unvested equity awards will be converted into corresponding equity awards of Parent under the terms of
the Merger Agreement and continue to vest pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plan and the applicable awards agreements. Upon Mr.
Storch’s retirement, his 3,525 Company RSUs were converted into 3,525 Company Restricted Shares.

Each non-employee director receives quarterly grants of restricted stock with an annual value equal to $130,000 and such quarterly installments
vest immediately upon the grant date. As a result, as of December 31, 2022, each non-employee director will have received all four annual
installments and, therefore, none of the directors will hold outstanding and unvested equity awards.
Severance Entitlements
Each of the executive officers entered into a Change of Control Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2015 (or, in the case of Mr. Patriacca, February
8, 2022) with the Company (the “CIC Agreements”). Each CIC Agreement provides for severance payments and other benefits in the event of a
“qualifying termination”, which generally means a termination of employment by the Company without “cause” within the ninety 90 day period prior to a
change in control that is in connection with or in anticipation of such change in control at the request of, or upon the initiative of, the buyer in the change
in control transaction), or by the Company without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason” (as described below) within the 24-month period
following, a change in control of Altra. The Merger will constitute a change in control of Altra for purposes of the CIC Agreements. For purposes of the
CIC Agreements, “good reason” generally means (i) without the executive’s express consent, any material change in the executive’s job title, any
significant change in the executive’s reporting relationships or a significant reduction of the executive’s duties, position or responsibilities relative to the
executive’s duties, position or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction, or the executive’s removal from such position, duties and
responsibilities, unless the executive is provided with comparable duties, position and responsibilities, (ii) a material reduction by the Company (other
than a reduction on the same basis as other senior executives) in the kind or level of employee benefits to which the executive is entitled immediately prior
to such reduction with the result that the executive’s overall benefits package is significantly reduced, (iii) a relocation that is more than 50 miles from the
executive’s then-current principal work location or (iv) the Company’s failure to cause executive’s employment agreement and its obligations thereunder
to be expressly assumed by Company’s successor.
In the event of a “qualifying termination”, each executive officer would be entitled to receive: (i) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of
(x) the executive’s applicable multiple (which is 3 in the case of Mr. Christenson and 2 in the case of all other executive officers) and (y) the sum of (a) the
executive’s annual base salary and (b) the executive’s target annual cash bonus; (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus for the portion of the
 
58
Table of Contents
year in which the termination occurs (with the proration based on the executive’s date of termination); and (iii) subsidized health and dental COBRA
premiums for up to 18 months. Receipt of the above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the applicable executive officer executing a
release of claims in favor of the Company. In addition, upon an executive officer’s “qualifying termination” all outstanding and unvested equity awards
would accelerate and vest in full.
The CIC Agreements provide that in the event that any payment or benefit (regardless of whether payable under the CIC Agreement or otherwise
and including the acceleration of equity awards) payable to an executive officer would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code, then such payment or benefit will be reduced below the limit under Section 280G of the Code if the executive officer would end up in a
better financial position than receiving the full amount and paying the 20% excise tax (such reduction, a “280G best-net cutback”). The CIC Agreements
do not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the “golden parachute” excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.
Please see the section below entitled “Quantification of Payments and Benefits” for a summary of the amounts payable to the Company’s executive
officers pursuant to the terms of the CIC Agreements.
Continuing Employee Benefits
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement, for a period of not less than one year following
the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who was an employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “continuing employee”), subject to such individual’s continued employment, with (i) a base salary
or wage rate, target annual cash bonus and long-term incentive opportunities that are, in each case, no less favorable than such continuing employee’s
base salary or wage rate, target annual cash bonus and long-term incentive opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect
to any provisions relating to a change in control) and (iii) other compensation and benefits (other than base salary, wage rate, bonus and long-term
incentive opportunities, change in control and severance payments) that have a value that is substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to
such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent has agreed to, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) recognize a continuing employee’s service with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes, including determining such continuing employee’s eligibility to participate, level of benefits and
vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, under benefit plans in which continuing employees will participate after the Effective Time
(subject to certain exceptions), (ii) cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods applicable to
continuing employees under the Parent’s, or the Surviving Corporation’s, or any of their respective subsidiaries’ welfare plans to be waived, to the extent
such limitations were waived or satisfied prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide continuing employees with credit under any such welfare plan for any
co-payments, deductibles or similar payments incurred during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.
With respect to annual bonuses payable under the Company’s annual bonus plan during the fiscal year in which the closing of the Merger occurs,
Parent has agreed to pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay pro-rated bonuses equal to the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the calendar year in which the closing of the Merger occurs that have elapsed as of the closing of the Merger, and the denominator of
which is 365, and (ii) the amount of the applicable continuing employee’s target bonus or, if greater, the bonus he or she would be entitled to receive
based on actual performance.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Company may establish a retention and transaction bonus program for the benefit of employees and
other service providers of the Company and any of its subsidiaries, make
 
59
Table of Contents
individual awards thereunder and enter into individual award agreements; provided that under such programs the aggregate amount payable cannot
exceed $19.7 million ($13.7 million of which will be used for individual awards to employees below the named executive officer level (the “General Pool”)
and the remaining $6 million of which may be granted to the named executive officers if, despite mitigation efforts, such executives will receive “excess
parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code)). The named executive officers are not eligible to receive a retention
award from the General Pool.
Director Compensation
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board will continue to receive cash and equity retainers in the ordinary course of
business, provided that the Company may pay any unpaid cash retainer for the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time occurs without proration.  
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies immediately following the completion of the Merger. For a more
detailed description of the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance”.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s named executive officers estimates of the
amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger and that will or may become payable to the named executive officer either
immediately at the Effective Time (i.e., on a “single-trigger” basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment on or following the
completion of the Merger (i.e., on a “double-trigger” basis). The holders of shares of Altra common stock are being asked to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, such compensation for these named executive officers. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be
binding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of shares
of Altra common stock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such
compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under “—Interests of
the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (a)
an assumption that the Merger is completed on December 31, 2022, (b) a per share Merger Consideration of $62.00, (c) the named executive officers’ salary
and total eligible bonus levels as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and
Company PSUs held by the named executive officers as of November 17, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of
this proxy statement, and excluding any additional grants that may occur following such date and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to December 31, 2022, and (e) an assumption that each named executive
officer (other than Mr. Storch) is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the named executive officer for “good reason” (each, as defined in the
CIC Agreement) immediately following the completion of the Merger. In addition, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple
assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before the completion of the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may
materially differ from the amounts set forth below. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may accelerate the payment of the Company
PSUs granted in 2020, which will vest in the ordinary course on December 31, 2022 based on actual performance, and settle such awards in early
December 2022.

Table of Contents
The amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section 280G best-net cutback; therefore,
actual payments to the named executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below.

The estimated amounts shown in this column represent (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the executive’s applicable multiple
(which is 3 in the case of Mr. Christenson and 2 in the case of all other named executive officers) and (2) the sum of (x) the named executive officer’s
annual base salary and (y) the named executive officer’s target annual cash bonus and (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination,
assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022. The value of the pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date
of December 31, 2022, for Messrs. Christenson, Deegan, Patriacca and Schuele is $1,094,889, 268,920, 299,000 and 180,444, respectively. These
payments are “double-trigger”, as they will only be payable in the event of a “qualifying termination” within the 90 day period prior to or within the
24 month period following the change of control (including the Merger). In addition, such payments are subject to the executive’s execution and
non-revocation of a general release of claims and compliance with certain restrictive covenants. Details of the cash amounts are shown in the

The estimated amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate intrinsic value of the named executive officers’ outstanding unvested
Company Options (the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration of $62.00 over the applicable exercise price) and the aggregate value of
outstanding unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the estimated payments in respect of the
named executive officers’ (other than Mr. Stoch) unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs as shown in the following table
are “double-trigger” benefits in that they will be paid to the named executive officer only if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying
termination of employment within the 90 day period prior to, or within the 24 month period following, the change of control (including the Merger).
Mr. Storch retired from the Company effective as of January 31, 2022. As an authorized retiree, Mr. Storch’s equity awards remain outstanding and,
following the Effective Time, Mr. Storch’s unvested equity awards will be converted into corresponding equity awards of Parent under the

The estimated amounts shown in this column represent subsidized health and welfare benefits premiums for 18 months, which is the maximum
period under the CIC Agreement and calculated based on the applicable premium rates in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These are
“double-trigger” benefits in that they will be paid to the named executive officer only if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying
termination of employment under the CIC Agreement within the 90 day period prior to, or within the 24 month period following, the change of
control (including the Merger).
(4)
As noted in footnote (2) above, Mr. Storch retired from the Company, effective January 31, 2022 and will not receive any merger-related
compensation other with respect to his equity awards. Under applicable SEC disclosure rules, Mr. Storch is considered a named executive officer for

As of the date of this proxy statement, there are no employment, equity or other agreements, arrangements or understandings between any of the
Company’s directors or executive officers, on the one hand, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, and the Merger is not
conditioned upon any of the Company’s directors or executive officers entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.

There is no financing condition to the Merger. Regal Rexnord plans to fund the Merger Consideration with cash on hand and committed debt
financing, as described below.
In connection with the Merger, on October 26, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into the Commitment Letter with JPMorgan pursuant to which
JPMorgan (i) committed to provide Regal Rexnord with, among other things, the Bridge Facility for the purpose of funding, in part, the Merger
Consideration, paying certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and related transactions and for general corporate purposes and (ii) agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange financing (through the issuance of notes and/or the incurrence of term loans) in an aggregate principal amount
of up to $5.5 billion for the purpose of replacing the Bridge Facility.
On March 28, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement providing for the Parent Existing Credit
Facility. In connection with the Merger, on November 17, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into the First Amendment to the Parent Existing Credit Facility
pursuant to which, among other things, the lenders party thereto agreed to provide $600 million of additional commitments under the Term Loan Credit
Facilities and $500 million of additional commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Merger was permitted, the incurrence of debt in connection
with the Merger was permitted and certain covenants were modified. Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the increased commitments under the
Term Loan Credit Facilities will be available to fund, in part, the Merger Consideration, pay certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and related
transactions and for general corporate purposes.

On November 30, 2022, Regal Rexnord entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement to the Parent Existing Credit Facility pursuant to which,
among other things, the lenders party thereto agreed to provide $240 million of additional commitments under the Term Loan Credit Facilities and $70
million of additional commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the increased commitments under the
Term Loan Credit Facilities will be available to fund, in part, the Merger Consideration, pay certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and related
transactions and for general corporate purposes.
The aggregate principal amount of the increased commitments under the Term Loan Credit Facilities have reduced on a dollar for dollar basis a
corresponding amount of the commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter. As a result, there are
now $4.66 billion in Bridge Facility commitments remaining.

The Merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Altra
common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of
their shares of Altra common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Altra
common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to
receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Altra common stock following
petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Altra
common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to the
 
63Table of Contents
Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set
forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of
Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such
rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to
exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons seek to
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of a
person’s appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration under
the Merger Agreement.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Altra common stock who (i) continuously holds such shares through the Effective Time, (ii)
has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the
procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial
owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides
documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth
on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Altra common stock exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the stockholders be notified that
appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of
Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without
subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Altra common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must deliver to the
Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Altra common stock before the taking of the vote on the Merger, which demand must
reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Altra common stock for which appraisal is demanded and, for beneficial owners
only, such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to
receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List; you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement; you must hold your shares of Altra common stock continuously through the Effective Time; and you must comply with the other
applicable requirements of Section 262.

A record holder who holds shares of Altra common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In
such case, the demand must set forth the number of shares of Altra common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of shares of Altra
common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Altra common stock outstanding in the name of such record
owner.
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give written notice that the Merger has become effective to each of (a)
the Company’s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and (b) the beneficial owners who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any
person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the Merger
Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person’s shares of Altra common stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation and any person who has properly and
timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court,
with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of
Altra common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation
will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Altra common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to
have their shares of Altra common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time
periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as
provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger
Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions
of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
of Altra common stock not voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving Corporation and
the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be given within
 
65
Table of Contents
ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for
the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving
Corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Altra common stock and with whom
the Surviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (the “Chancery List”). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by
the Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the Surviving
Corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will determine which persons have
complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares of Altra common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of
Altra common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to comply with
such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. The Delaware Court will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all
holders of shares of Altra common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds
1% of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds
$1 million.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the
Chancery List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court, including
any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of Altra
common stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion, determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the
judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving
Corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (1)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of Altra common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (2)
interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the Surviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.
When the fair value of the shares of Altra common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such value, with interest
thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or
the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any
person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of the
relevant shares of Altra common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.

Table of Contents
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated
that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the
merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass
known elements of value”, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have
decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person’s exclusive remedy.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable
in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys’ and expert
witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred
expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Altra common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant
to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by
the Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Any person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares of Altra
common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions
payable to Altra stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to
the Delaware Court made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become
entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will
govern.

67Table of Contents
New York, by a purported Altra stockholder, in each case naming as defendants Altra and members of the Board. The complaints allege, among other
things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the
Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek orders enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger, requiring the defendants to disclose
certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the preliminary proxy statement, rescinding the Merger in the event that it is
consummated or granting rescissory damages, accounting to the plaintiffs for all damages they suffered as a result of the alleged wrongdoing, awarding
costs, including attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.
On November 30, 2022, Altra received a demand letter from a purported Altra stockholder, Matthew Whitfield, alleging disclosure deficiencies in the
preliminary proxy statement relating to Altra’s financial projections and certain financial analyses performed by Altra’s financial advisor.
On December 1, 2022, Altra received a demand letter from a purported Altra stockholder, Robert Garfield, alleging disclosure deficiencies in the
preliminary proxy statement relating to Altra’s financial projections and certain financial analyses performed by Altra’s financial advisor.
On December 1, 2022, Altra received a demand letter from a purported Altra stockholder, Alex Ciccotelli, alleging disclosure deficiencies in the
preliminary proxy statement relating to Altra’s post-Merger employment arrangements, Altra’s financial projections and certain financial analyses
performed by Altra’s financial advisor.
These letters demand that Altra and members of the Board issue corrective disclosures to cure the alleged deficiencies in the proxy statement
disclosures prior to the anticipated stockholder vote on the Merger.
Altra believes that the complaints and demands are without merit and that no further disclosure is required to supplement the proxy statement
under applicable laws. As of December 13, 2022, Altra was not aware of the filing of other lawsuits or the submission of other demand letters challenging
the Merger and/or alleging deficiencies with respect to the proxy statement; however, such lawsuits or demand letters may be filed or submitted,
respectively, in the future.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",75,76

The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders
and non-U.S. Holders (each, as defined below) of shares of Altra common stock whose shares of Altra common stock are converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Altra common stock as
“capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for
investment). This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of
counsel has or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
 
68Table of Contents
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to holders subject to special rules under
the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:
 
•
banks and other financial institutions;
 
•
mutual funds;
 
•
insurance companies;
 
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
 
•
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of Altra common stock;
 
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
 
•
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
 
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds;
 
•
holders that hold shares of Altra common stock as part of a “straddle”, hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction or
conversion transaction or similar transactions;
 
•
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 
•
partnerships, other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations”, or any other
pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);
 
•
holders that own or have owned at any time (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Altra common stock (by vote or value);
 
•
holders that received their shares of Altra common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-qualified retirement plan, pursuant to
the exercise of options or warrants or otherwise as compensation;
 
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
•
expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;
 
•
holders subject to any alternative minimum tax;
 
•
grantor trusts;
 
•
controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies;
 
•
holders that hold their Altra common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or
resident outside of the United States;
 
•
holders that exercise their appraisal rights in connection with the Merger;
 
•
holders that own, directly, indirectly or constructively, an equity interest in Parent following the Merger; and
 
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Altra common stock as a result of such income
being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.
This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger. This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as
the federal estate or gift tax, any
 
69
Table of Contents
alternative minimum tax, or the application of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code) or any state, local or non-U.S.
income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations in respect of any withholding required
pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental
agreements entered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). This discussion
does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the Merger.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of
Altra common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the
activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of
Altra common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR ALTRA
STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE ALTRA STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR
TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME,
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Altra common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:
 
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
•
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or
 
•
a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust
validly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Altra common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Altra common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Altra common
stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Altra common stock will generally equal the amount that
such U.S. Holder paid for such shares. A U.S. Holder’s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Altra common stock generally will be characterized as
capital gain or loss, and any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is
more than one year at the time of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain
 
70
Table of Contents
non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Altra common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder
must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Altra common stock that it holds.
Non-U.S. Holders
In general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S. Holder in exchange for shares
of Altra common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 
•
the gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. Holder in
the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. Holder’s permanent establishment in the
United States);
 
•
the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain
other conditions are met; or
 
•
shares of Altra common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of Altra’s status as a “United States real property
holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code (a “USRPHC”) at any time during the shorter of the five-year
period ending on the date of the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of Altra common stock (the
“Relevant Period”).
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in substantially the same
manner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be
provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on its “effectively connected earnings and profits” for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.
A non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate
as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which generally may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-
U.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year (if any), provided the non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such
losses.
With respect to the third bullet point above, Altra believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the five-year period ending on
the date of the Effective Time. Even if Altra is or was a USRPHC during the Relevant Period, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash in
exchange for shares of Altra common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Altra common stock is “regularly
traded”, as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and constructively,
5% or less of the Altra common stock throughout the Relevant Period.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders in connection
with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless
the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct
taxpayer identification number and certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and
otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.
 
71
Table of Contents
A non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) unless the non-U.S. Holder
provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS
Form W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder’s status as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder or a non-U.S. Holder generally
will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s or non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-
U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Altra Industrial Motion Corp._20221214_DEFM14A_20506388_4559723.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) to use its reasonable best
efforts to, among other things, cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other in connection with any filing, submission or written communication
with a governmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a governmental authority related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, Parent has agreed to,
as promptly as reasonably practicable, take all actions necessary to (a) secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act or, with respect to any Other Regulatory Approval, any other antitrust law or investment screening law, (b) obtain the Other Regulatory
Approvals and (c) resolve any objections asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under any applicable law
raised by any governmental authority, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reverted or overturned, any Restraint that would
prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (such expirations, terminations,
approvals and resolutions, collectively, the “Required Approvals”), in each case subject to certain limitations, including that Parent will not be required to
take any such action if it would or would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of or require a Burdensome Condition. For a detailed
description of regulatory matters, please see below under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Consummate
the Merger”.
The approvals required under the Merger Agreement include expiry or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as well as receipt of the
Other Regulatory Approvals.
We currently expect to complete the Merger in the first half of 2023. However, we cannot predict the exact timing of completion of the Merger
because we cannot guarantee when all of the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
Under the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or been terminated. A
transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the
 
72Table of Contents
expiration of a 30-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission (the
“FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (a
“Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run
only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree
to extend the waiting period. The parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on November 9, 2022. Regal Rexnord withdrew its filing on
December 9, 2022, and refiled as of December 13, 2022, such that the initial 30-day waiting period is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
January 12, 2023.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We
cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Other Regulatory Approvals
In addition to the HSR Act, the consummation of the Merger is also subject to receipt of consents, approvals or other clearances under (a) the
antitrust laws of Australia, China, the European Union, Turkey and the United Kingdom, (b) the investment screening laws of Australia, the Czech
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, (c) the investment screening laws of certain specified jurisdictions, to the extent such
laws enter into force prior to Closing and Parent determines in accordance with terms set forth in the confidential disclosure schedules that approval is
required under such laws and (d) the investment screening laws of a specified jurisdiction if, prior to the Effective Time, the applicable governmental
authority in such jurisdiction requests Parent to provide notice of the Merger (collectively, the “Other Regulatory Approvals”).
As of December 13, 2022, the parties submitted filings, or drafts thereof, with the applicable governmental authorities under (a) the antitrust laws of
China and Turkey and (b) the investment screening laws of Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.
In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable,
including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

Unless the parties agree in writing otherwise, the closing of the merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third business day
after all conditions to the consummation of the merger have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived; provided that if the Marketing

The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each share of Altra common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Altra Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $62.00 in cash, without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes. Following the Effective Time, each holder of Altra common stock will cease to have any rights with respect to
such common stock, except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor.
If, between October 26, 2022 and the Effective Time, the number of shares of outstanding Altra common stock changes into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Altra common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change, or any such
action shall have been declared with a record date within said period, then the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to the
Merger Agreement will be appropriately and equitably adjusted to reflect such event; provided that (i) the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant
to the Merger Agreement after giving effect to such event will not exceed the amount that would have been payable had such event not occurred and (ii)
the Company may not take any action with respect to its securities that is expressly prohibited by the terms of the Merger Agreement.

At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows:
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided that any such Company Option with an exercise price per share that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each outstanding Company Option that is unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be converted into
an award of stock options to purchase a number of Parent common shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the
number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii)
the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company
Option will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and exercisability as were applicable to the
related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a restricted stock unit
denominated in Parent common shares (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock
subject to such unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each
converted Company RSU will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting as were applicable to the
related Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
each outstanding Company RSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (ii) an amount in cash equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend
equivalents;
 
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is vested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Altra common stock subject to such vested Company PSU
(assuming all applicable performance measures for vested Company PSUs are satisfied at the actual level of performance (measured as of
the Effective Time), as determined by the Board in consultation with Parent) and (y) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) an amount in cash
equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividend equivalents);
 
•
each outstanding Company PSU that is unvested prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into an award of time-based
restricted stock denominated in Parent common shares equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the sum of (x) the
number of shares of Altra

dividend equivalents divided by (2) the Merger Consideration (assuming all applicable performance measures are satisfied at (i) the actual

respect to any performance period that is scheduled to expire after the Effective Time, in each case, as determined by the Board in
consultation with Parent) multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each converted Company PSU will be subject to
substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting terms as were applicable to the applicable Company PSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the award will only be subject to time-based vesting conditions; and
 
•
each outstanding Company Restricted Share will be converted into a Restricted Cash Award equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Altra common stock subject to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Each Restricted Cash Award will be subject to substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and forfeiture as were
applicable to the applicable Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the form of payment upon vesting
and settlement will be in cash.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plan) will adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be required to effectuate the actions required by Section 2.03 of the Merger Agreement. All amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.03 of the Merger Agreement will be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and will be paid without interest.
Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than the first payroll date that occurs more than five (5) business days following the
Effective Time), Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Merger Agreement to the
former holders of vested Company Options, vested Company RSUs and vested Company PSUs, as applicable; provided, however, that, to the extent any
such amounts constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such amounts will be paid at the earliest time
following the Effective Time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement or Company Stock Plan relating to such Company Option, Company
RSU or Company PSU that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
If Parent does not elect to assume the Company Stock Plan, the Company will, prior to the Effective Time, take such actions as are necessary to
cause the Company Stock Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time and Parent will grant the converted Company Options, Company RSUs,
Company PSUs and Restricted Cash Awards under an equity plan of Parent.

Parent will appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) to make payment of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration.
From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Altra common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any shares of Altra common stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.
 
77Table of Contents
Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the third business day after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Altra stockholder of record of a certificate whose shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Each such Altra stockholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificates, together
with the associated letter of transmittal, duly completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as
may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent. ALTRA STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT FORWARD THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES TO THE
PAYING AGENT WITHOUT A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND SHOULD NOT RETURN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED
PROXY CARD.
The transmittal instructions will tell holders of Altra common stock what to do if they have lost a certificate or if a certificate has been stolen or
destroyed. Any such Altra stockholder will have to provide an affidavit to that fact and, if required by Parent, post a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent directs as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, upon which the Paying Agent shall issue the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Altra common stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate.
Each Altra stockholder of record that holds their shares in book-entry will not be required to deliver an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent. Each such Altra stockholder whose shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement will receive from the
Paying Agent, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such book-entry share, and such book-entry shares
shall be forthwith canceled.
Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of any of the Merger Consideration, and the amount of any Merger Consideration paid to Altra
stockholders may be reduced by the amount of applicable withholding taxes.

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, have made to one another, which are qualified (i) by confidential disclosures made by the Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, (ii) in
many cases by materiality or Material Adverse Effect standards and (iii) with respect to the disclosures made by the Company, by certain documents filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC by the Company and publicly available one business day prior to the date of the Merger Agreement.
A “Material Adverse Effect” with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries is defined in the Merger Agreement to mean any effect, change,
event or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the following, and no effect, change, event or occurrence to the extent arising out of, or resulting from,
the following, shall constitute or be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, is continuing or would reasonably
be expected to occur: any effect, change, event or occurrence (A) generally affecting (1) the industry in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate
or (2) the economy, credit, financial, commodity or capital markets, in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest or
exchange rates, monetary policy or inflation, or (B) arising out of, resulting from or attributable to (1) changes or prospective changes in law or in GAAP
or in accounting standards, or any changes or prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, or any changes or
prospective changes in general legal, regulatory, political or social conditions, (2) the negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of the Merger
Agreement or the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the identity of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates, in each case, including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, landlords,
distributors, partners, employees or regulators, or any litigation arising from the Merger Agreement or

otherwise restrict the making of or amendment or modification to Takeover Proposals, or (b) any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement, it being understood that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to waive or release any preexisting explicit or implicit
standstill provisions or similar agreements with any person or group of persons.
A “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof has determined in
its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) (i) would be more favorable from a financial point of view to the

and the Merger Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the potential time delays and other
risks to consummation associated with such offer) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all legal, regulatory, financial,
financing and other aspects of such proposal and of the Merger Agreement; provided that for purposes of the definition of “Superior Proposal”, the
references to “20%” in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.

such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer. The Company is required to keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the

connection therewith and any drafts of agreements or term sheets or similar documents (including financing commitments or arrangements) if they
contain material terms related to such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, in each case, exchanged between the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or its or their representatives, on the one hand, and the person or group making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, or any of
their respective representatives, on the other hand.

Superior Proposal and (2) confirms its recommendation of the Merger Agreement, as amended to give effect to the binding changes
proposed by Parent, to the extent applicable, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement).
Prior to taking any of the actions set forth in the immediately preceding bullet points,
 
•
the Company must give Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify, as applicable, the Intervening Event and the reason for such Adverse Recommendation Change or the identity of the party making
such Superior Proposal and the terms and conditions thereof (including a copy of any proposed definitive agreements between the
Company and the party making such Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments or arrangements provided to the
Company by the party making such Superior Proposal, in each case to be entered into in connection with such Superior Proposal));
 
•
during the three business days after the date of receipt by Parent of such notice (the “Negotiation Period”), the Company has negotiated,
and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such Negotiation Period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Debt
Commitment Letter such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or such that the Intervening
Event no longer requires an Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable; and
 
•
following the end of such Negotiation Period, the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such
binding offer, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions
proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect or such Intervening Event continues to require an Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable;
provided, that if during the Negotiation Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal and such revisions are material (with any change to
the consideration payable to Altra stockholders in connection with such proposal being deemed material), the Company shall deliver a new notice to
Parent and shall comply with the foregoing requirements with respect to such new notice except that the references to three business days will be deemed
to be two business days.
An “Intervening Event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, occurrence or change that (i) was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable (with
respect to magnitude or material consequences) by, the Board prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance,
occurrence or change, becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii)
does not relate to a Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that an “Intervening Event” shall not include (A) any Takeover Proposal or other inquiry,
offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (B) an event, fact, circumstance, occurrence or change resulting from
a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company or any event, fact circumstance, occurrence or change relating to Parent or its affiliates, (C) changes
in the price of the Altra common stock, in and of itself (provided, however, the underlying reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event
unless excluded by any other exclusion in this definition) or (D) the fact that, in and of itself, the Company exceeds any internal or published projections,

estimates or expectations of the Company’s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (provided, however,
the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an Intervening Event unless expressly excluded by any other exclusion in this definition).

Employee by the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in Section 5.08 of the Merger Agreement or
elsewhere in the Merger Agreement will be construed to create a right in any Continuing Employee to employment with Parent or the Surviving

periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or
beneficiaries under the corresponding Company welfare benefit plan in which such employees participated immediately prior to the completion of the

law or the terms of the applicable welfare plan) and (ii) provide Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any

requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

amount of the applicable continuing employee’s target bonus or, if greater, the bonus he or she would be entitled to receive based on actual performance
(as determined by the Company in accordance with past practice).
Unless Parent, in its sole discretion, elects to maintain the Company’s existing 401(k) plan, the Company will take all necessary or advisable actions
to terminate its 401(k) plan prior to the Closing Date. Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
created or designated by Parent (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) and the Parent 401(k) Plan will provide for the receipt of “eligible rollover distributions”,

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Altra is required to submit a proposal to Altra stockholders
to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Altra’s named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Compensation Proposal”). This
compensation is summarized in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Altra’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger”. The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this
proxy statement. Accordingly, Altra is asking you to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Altra approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to
Altra’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the
section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Altra’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote
to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation
Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Altra. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Approval, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding shares of Altra
common stock properly cast for and against the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is
present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b)
abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of
the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Altra common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If an Altra stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such
proxy card, the shares of Altra common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum
for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If Altra stockholders
approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time
to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Altra stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against
the Merger Agreement Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their
votes to votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or
otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal (a) when a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Altra common
stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, and (b) when a quorum is not present, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of
shares of Altra common stock representing a majority of the voting power present at the Special Meeting.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the
Adjournment Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no
effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Adjournment Proposal. Shares of Altra common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If an Altra stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such
proxy card, the shares of Altra common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum
for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

filings by the beneficial owners with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance
with rules adopted by the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares
of Altra common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or warrants or the conversion of other securities held by that person that are currently
exercisable or convertible, or are exercisable or convertible within 60 days of November 17, 2022, are deemed to be issued and outstanding. These shares,
however, are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing percentage ownership of each other stockholder. Percentage of beneficial ownership
is otherwise based on 65,169,434 shares of Altra common stock outstanding as of November 17, 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities

Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (“Parent”), Aspen Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and
Altra Industrial Motion Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 8.12.
WHEREAS, the parties intend that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”);
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (a) duly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger Transactions, (b) determined that it is in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement and declared this Agreement advisable and (c) recommended that the Company’s
stockholders adopt this Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the stockholders
of Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement and declared this Agreement advisable and (b) duly authorized and approved the
execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions;
WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement by written consent immediately following
its execution; and
WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
The Merger
SECTION 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is
hereinafter referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”.
SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third business
day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 or remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their
electronic counterparts), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than any such
 
A-1
Table of Contents
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the parties hereto shall not be required to effect the Closing until the earlier of (a) a
business day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than two business days’ prior written notice to the Company and (b) the third
business day after the final day of the Marketing Period, in each case, subject to the satisfaction or waiver, of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time).
The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the “Closing Date”.
SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the “Certificate of Merger”), and shall make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the “Secretary of State”) or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such later time as is agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the filing of
the Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the “Effective
Time”).
SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable
provisions, including Section 259, of the DGCL.
SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended or restated as provided therein or by applicable Law (and, in each case, subject to Section 5.06 hereof), except that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Altra Industrial Motion Corp.”
SECTION 1.06. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.
(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
ARTICLE II
Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates; 
Equity-Based Awards
SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (“Company Common
Stock”) or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:
(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
 
A-2
Table of Contents
(b) Cancelation of Certain Shares. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company
Common Stock then held by Parent or Merger Sub shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than Merger
Sub) shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at the election of Parent, either (i) converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled with no consideration delivered in exchange therefor.
(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) Appraisal Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.07, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or
converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (iii) Company Restricted Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.03(c)) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $62.00 per share, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a “Certificate”) or of non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with this
Article II.
SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount
in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, other than amounts payable in accordance with Section 2.05 (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying
Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.
(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three business days thereafter), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Certificates (other than
(A) the Certificates representing Appraisal Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.07 and (B) the Certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying
 
A-3
Table of Contents
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with such letter’s instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (1) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (2) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid (or caused to be paid) any transfer and other Taxes required to be paid by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable pursuant to this Section 2.02.
(c) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section
2.01(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, subject to compliance with customary procedures of the Paying Agent with respect thereto,
each registered holder of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as possible after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith canceled. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be made only to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
(d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(f), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.
(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II. Any amounts remaining
 
A-4
Table of Contents
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.
(g) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or
other escheat, abandoned property or similar Law.
(h) Withholding. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), or under any provision of U.S. state or local or non-U.S.
Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
SECTION 2.03. Equity-Based Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that:
(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, a “Company Stock Option”)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, which is fully vested and exercisable (a “Vested Company Stock Option”), shall, at
the Effective Time, be canceled and the holder of any such canceled Vested Company Stock Option shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such canceled Vested Company Stock Option, a lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Vested Company Stock Option has not then been exercised and (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Stock Option; provided that any such Vested
Company Stock Option with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a Company Stock Option is subject to an award agreement, an
employment agreement or other contract with an individual holder in effect as of the date hereof that provides that such Company Stock Option shall vest
solely upon a change of control involving the Company (without the required occurrence of termination or any other event), such Company Stock Option
shall be treated as set forth in this section as if such Company Stock Option was a Vested Company Stock Option.
(b) Each Company Stock Option, or portion thereof, granted under the Company Stock Plan which is not a Vested Company Stock Option
(an “Unvested Company Stock Option”) shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to represent an option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common stock subject to such
Unvested Company Stock Option immediately prior to such time and (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Unvested Company Stock Option immediately prior
to such time divided by (B) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio; provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to the Unvested Company Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code; provided further, that in the case of any Unvested Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to
such
 
A-5
Table of Contents
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as provided above, following the time of the
conversion contemplated above, each such Unvested Company Option shall continue to be governed by substantially similar terms and conditions with
respect to vesting and exercisability terms as were applicable to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to such time. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term “Equity Award Conversion Ratio” means the quotient of (1) the Merger Consideration divided by (2) the Closing Date VWAP. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term “Closing Date VWAP” means the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of shares of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by the Parties,
acting reasonably), on each of the five consecutive Trading Days ending on (and including) the Trading Day that is three Trading Days prior to the
Closing Date.
(c) Each share of Company Common Stock subject to forfeiture conditions, including those received as dividend equivalents, granted under
the Company Stock Plan (each, a “Company Restricted Share”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a Company Restricted Share denominated in shares of
Company Common Stock and shall be converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, (a “Restricted Cash Award”)
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration. Except as provided above, following the time of conversion contemplated above, each such Restricted Cash
Award shall continue to be governed by substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting and forfeiture terms as were applicable to the
applicable Company Restricted Share immediately prior to such time.
(d) Each restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan, including any
Company RSU subject to performance-based vesting conditions or any right to receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company
Stock Plan in the form of “performance shares” (each, a “Company RSU”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, which is
fully vested (a “Vested Company RSU”), shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration
plus (ii) the amount of any accrued dividend equivalents with respect to such Vested Company RSU that remain unpaid as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company RSUs subject to performance-based
vesting conditions shall be determined by the Company Board of Directors (subject to consultation with Parent) as follows: (x) for any performance
period that expires on or prior to the Effective Time, performance shall be deemed achieved based on actual performance during such performance period
and (y) for any performance period that is scheduled to expire after the Effective Time, performance shall be deemed achieved based on the greater of (1)
target level and (2) actual performance, measured based on performance through the Effective Time, calculated in accordance with the underlying award
agreement; provided, further, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a Company RSU is subject to an award agreement, an
employment agreement or other contract with an individual holder in effect as of the date hereof that provides that such Company RSU shall vest solely
upon a change of control involving the Company (without the required occurrence of termination or any other event), such Company RSU shall be
treated as set forth in this section as if such Company RSU was a Vested Company RSU.
(e) Each Company RSU which is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company RSU”), shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Company Common Stock
and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a “Parent RSU”); provided that, any such Unvested
Company RSU that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall instead be converted into restricted stock denominated in shares of Parent
Common Stock (a “Parent Restricted Share”). The number of
 
A-6
Table of Contents
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent RSU shall be equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion
Ratio. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Restricted Share shall be equal to the product (rounded to the nearest
whole number) of (i) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (B) (x) the amount of any accrued dividend equivalents with respect to such Unvested Company RSU that remain unpaid as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio; provided, however, that the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company RSUs subject to performance-based vesting conditions and the amount of any accrued
dividend equivalent with respect thereto shall be determined by the Company Board of Directors (subject to consultation with Parent) as follows: (x) for
any performance period that expires on or prior to the Effective Time, performance shall be deemed achieved based on actual performance during such
performance period and (y) for any performance period that is scheduled to expire after the Effective Time, performance shall be deemed achieved based
on the greater of (1) target level and (2) actual performance, measured based on performance through the Effective Time, calculated in accordance with the
underlying award agreement. Additionally, except as provided above, following the time of conversion contemplated above, each such Parent RSU or
Parent Restricted Share shall continue to be governed by substantially similar terms and conditions with respect to vesting terms as were applicable to
the applicable Company RSU or Parent Restricted Share immediately prior to such time provided that the level of performance for such Company RSU or
Parent Restricted Share will be permanently fixed at the levels set forth above.
SECTION 2.04. Company Equity Plans. If Parent so elects, Parent may, in its sole discretion, assume any or all of the Company Stock Plans;
provided, however, that if the Parent does not elect to assume such Company Stock Plans, the Company Stock Options, Parent RSUs, Parent Restricted
Shares and Restricted Cash Awards contemplated under Sections 2.03(b), 2.03(c) and 2.03(e) shall be granted under the Parent Stock Plans. To the extent
that Parent does not elect to assume one or more of the Company Stock Plans, in response to written notice from Parent delivered not less than 10
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, at or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board and the compensation committee of the Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take all steps necessary to (i) cause such Company Stock Plan(s) to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither the Parent, the Company nor any of their successors or Affiliates will be required to deliver
shares or other capital stock of the Company or Parent to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards pursuant thereto.
SECTION 2.05. Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the first
payroll date that occurs more than five business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate shall pay through its
payroll systems (or, if a payroll systems payment is not reasonably practicable, by wire transfer) the amounts due pursuant to Section 2.03; provided,
however, that in the case of any such amounts that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement that will not trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
SECTION 2.06. Adjustments. If between the date hereof and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change, or any such action shall have been declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to reflect such stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change; provided, however, that

(a) in no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant to Section 2.01 after giving effect to any such event exceed the amount that would
have been payable pursuant to Section 2.01 had such event not occurred and (b) nothing in this Section 2.06 shall permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
SECTION 2.07. Appraisal Rights. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“Appraisal Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead shall be canceled and shall represent the right to receive only those rights
provided under Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such Person shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such Person to receive those rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon.
(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock and Parent shall have the right to participate in and, after the Effective Time, direct all negotiations and Actions with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle (or offer to settle), any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company, except as set forth in the confidential disclosure letter
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company concurrently with or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the “Parent Disclosure Letter”) (it
being understood that any information, item or matter set forth on one section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed
with respect to, and shall be deemed to apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of this Article IV of this Agreement to which it corresponds in
number and each other section or subsection of this Article IV of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent based on the content of such
disclosure that such information, item or matter is relevant to such other section or subsection):
SECTION 4.01. Organization; Standing. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Wisconsin and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is in good standing
with the Secretary of State. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority necessary to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable
Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company complete and correct copies
of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s certificates of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement.
SECTION 4.02. Authority; Noncontravention. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and corporate
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The Board of Directors of

resolutions (i) authorizing, approving and declaring advisable and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder, the Merger and the
execution, delivery and performance by Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Merger Sub of the Transactions and (ii) directing that
Merger Sub submit the adoption of this Agreement to a vote at a meeting or by unanimous written consent of

Merger Sub’s stockholder, which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent
is necessary to approve this Agreement or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, will approve this Agreement and the Transactions (which approval shall be provided for by written consent of Parent)
immediately following simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 4.02(a), no other
corporate action (including any stockholder vote or other action) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No Takeover Laws apply or will apply to Parent or Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions.
(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
Transactions, nor performance or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable charter or organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) assuming that
the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in Section 4.03 are obtained prior to the Effective Time and the filings referred to in Section 4.03 are
made and any waiting periods with respect to such filings have terminated or expired prior to the Effective Time, (x) violate any Law or Judgment
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (y) violate or constitute a default under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party or accelerate Parent’s, Merger Sub’s or any of
their respective Subsidiaries’, if applicable, obligations under any such Contract, except, in the case of clause (ii), as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 4.03. Governmental Approvals. Except for (a) compliance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, including the
filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement, (b) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State pursuant to the DGCL and the filing of
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and
(c) filings required under, and compliance with other applicable requirements of, the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws and Investment Screening
Laws, no consent or approval of, or filing, license, permit or authorization, declaration or registration with, any Governmental Authority is necessary for
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and
the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, other than such other consents, approvals, filings, licenses, permits or authorizations,
declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is subject to any undertaking, requirement or obligation to obtain prior approval from, or
submit a notification or otherwise provide prior notice to, the FTC or the DOJ in connection with the Transactions (other than the requirements of the
HSR Act).
SECTION 4.04. Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub. Parent or a wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent owns
beneficially and of record all of the outstanding shares of Merger Sub, free and clear of all Liens. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions, has no liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to the Transactions,
and prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any other business activities other than those relating to the Transactions.
SECTION 4.05. Financing. At the Closing, assuming the funding of the Debt Financing in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter
and after giving effect to any “flex” provision in the Debt Commitment Letter or the related fee letters (including with respect to fees and original issue
discount), Parent will have immediately
 
A-23
Table of Contents
available funds in an amount as is necessary to consummate the Transactions, including the payment by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation of the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration, other amounts payable pursuant to Article II (including all amounts payable in respect
of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company RSUs under this Agreement), any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation and any other amounts, including Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, required to be paid in
connection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the Transactions (the “Required Amount”). As of the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the
Company (a) a correct and complete fully executed copy of the debt commitment letter, dated as of even date herewith, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments to such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement (as may be amended or modified in accordance with the terms hereof,
the “Debt Commitment Letter”) and (b) a copy of any fee letters related to the Debt Commitment Letter (the “Fee Letters” and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the “Financing Letters”) (which may be redacted to remove the fee amounts, economic terms and the terms of any “flex” provisions
that are customarily redacted in transactions of this type, none of which redactions covers terms that reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below the
Required Amount or adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Debt Financing). Pursuant to, and subject to the
terms and conditions of, the Debt Commitment Letter, the lender thereunder has committed to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes set forth
in such Debt Commitment Letter (the “Debt Financing”). As of the date hereof, neither the Debt Commitment Letter nor any Fee Letter has been amended,
restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, no amendment, restatement or other modification is
contemplated and the respective commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or
otherwise modified in any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (in each case, other than to add lenders, financial institutions,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities in a manner contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter). As of the date of this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are no conditions precedent to the obligation to make the Debt Financing available
to Parent pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and 6.02, the net proceeds of the Debt Financing will, in the aggregate and together with any cash or other funds
available to Parent and Merger Sub, be sufficient (after netting out any fees, original issue discount, expenses and similar premiums and charges payable
pursuant to the Financing Letters, including after giving effect to the maximum amount of any “flex” provisions) for the payment of the Required Amount.
As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent, in each case, on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other parties thereto under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 and taking into account the Marketing Period, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing or any other funds necessary to pay the Required Amount will not be available to Parent
on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) all commitment fees or other fees to the extent required to be paid on or prior to the date
of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. Except for the Fee Letters and customary engagement letters with respect to the Debt
Financing (none of which reduces the amount of the Debt Financing below the Required Amount or adversely affects the conditionality, enforceability,
termination or availability of the Debt Financing), as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any
kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letter to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters.
SECTION 4.06. Certain Arrangements. As of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral
or written and whether or not legally binding) or commitments to enter into Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written
and whether or not legally binding) between Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
 
A-24
Table of Contents
the Company’s management or Board of Directors or any beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock, on the other hand, that relate in any way
to post-Closing employment or equity rollovers. There are no Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written and whether or
not legally binding) or commitments to enter into Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written and whether or not legally
binding) pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive value or consideration (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
compensation for continuing employment and similar arrangements) of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote against or otherwise oppose any Superior
Proposal.
SECTION 4.07. Finders or Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or finder is entitled to any fee or commission in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except for
Persons, if any, whose fees and commissions will be paid by Parent.
SECTION 4.08. No Other Company Representations or Warranties. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that it and its
Representatives have received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company which it and its
Representatives have desired or requested to review, and that it and its Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company. Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person (a) has made or is making any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with
respect to any oral, written, video, electronic or other information provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives or any oral, written, video, electronic or other information developed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives or
(b) will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or Merger Sub resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other
distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives (in any form whatsoever and through any medium whatsoever), or the use
by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives, of any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-
looking information, business plans or other material developed by or provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives, including in due diligence materials, “data rooms” or management presentations (formal or informal, in person, by phone, through video
or in any other format), in anticipation or contemplation of any of the Transactions. Parent, on behalf of itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, expressly
waives any such claim relating to the foregoing matters. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and
Representatives) that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the business, operations, assets and financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives have relied on the results of their own independent investigation and have not relied on any express or implied
representations or warranties other than those expressly set forth in Article III.
SECTION 4.09. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) will, at the time the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first sent or given to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation
or warranty with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliates thereof for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or (b) Judgment imposed upon or affecting Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, in
each case, by or before any Governmental Authority.

and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives retained by it and acting on its behalf not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit
or knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) the making, submission or
announcement of any Takeover Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (B) make
available any information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent and Parent’s or the Company’s
Representatives acting in their capacity as such) in connection with or in response to a Takeover Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (C) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal (except to notify any Person of the

agreement or other similar Contract providing for, relating to or in connection with any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with Section 5.02(b)).
(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.02(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time on or
after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal
that did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a), (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact in writing (in each case, with a copy to Parent
promptly thereafter (and in any event within 24 hours)) such Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal or its or their Representatives to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, to negotiate the terms of such Takeover Proposal) or to request that any
Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing or to notify such Person or group of Persons or its or their Representatives of the provisions of this
Section 5.02 and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
then, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and any of its Representatives may (A) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has
made such Takeover Proposal and its or their respective Representatives and financing sources; provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (B) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal and its or their Representatives and financing sources and otherwise

(c) Prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in
the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of, and any material changes (it being understood and agreed that any change to the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Company in connection with such proposal is material) in, any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry,
proposal or offer, including by providing Parent with copies of all written proposals or offers received in connection therewith and any drafts of
agreements or term sheets or similar documents (including financing commitments or arrangements) if they contain material terms related to such
Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, in each case, exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives, on
the one hand, and the Person or group making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, or any of their respective Representatives, on the other
hand. For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.02(c) will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.
(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any duly authorized committee thereof (nor, in the case of clause (i)(B), (i)(C) or (i)
(D), any committee thereof) shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withhold, fail to make, or fail to include in the Proxy Statement, the Company Board
Recommendation or publicly propose to withhold the Company Board Recommendation, (B) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation, (C) recommend the approval or adoption
of, or approve or adopt, or submit to the vote of any securityholders of the Company, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt or submit, any
Takeover Proposal or (D) publicly agree or propose to take any such actions (it being understood that the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly
authorized committee thereof may, and may cause the Company to (1) make a customary “stop, look and listen” communication, (2) elect to take no
position with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer that is a Takeover Proposal prior to the 10th business day after the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, and such failure shall not, in and of itself, be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (3) if the Board of Directors of the Company has made the determination contemplated by Section 5.02(b) with respect to a
Takeover Proposal in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.02 and the Company determines that failing to publicly disclose such determination
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their duties to the Company or its stockholders under applicable Law,
disclose that the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof has determined that a Takeover Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (so long as such public disclosure expressly states that the Company Board of Directors
does not recommend, approve or endorse such Takeover Proposal) and any material facts and circumstances relating to such Takeover Proposal and
such determination) (any action described in this clause (i), other than the actions in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the parenthetical of the foregoing clause
(D), being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”), (ii) execute or enter into (or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement providing for or relating to a Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (iii) take any action to make the
provisions of any Takeover Law or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Takeover Proposal (including approving any transaction under the DGCL).
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, but not after, the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof may (i) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event or (ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and
did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a) and the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 5.02 in relation to such Takeover
Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or approve and cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement to effect such Takeover
Proposal and terminate this

Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), if the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (A) in the case of clause (i) where the Adverse Recommendation
Change is made in response to an Intervening Event, failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (B) in the case of clause (ii) where such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that if the Company has received such
a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company made the determination described in this clause (B) and the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes that the failure to publicly disclose such determination would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of
their duties to the Company or its stockholders under applicable Law, then such public disclosure shall not, in and of itself, be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change if following the Negotiation Period, the Board of Directors of the Company determines that the Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal and promptly (and in any event within one business day) following such determination, the Board of Directors of the
Company releases a public announcement that (1) states that the Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) confirms its
recommendation of this Agreement, as amended to give effect to the binding changes proposed by Parent, to the extent applicable, and the
Transactions); provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof shall not, and shall cause the
Company not to, take any action set forth in clause (i) or clause (ii), unless (I) the Company has given Parent at least three business days’ prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify, as applicable, the Intervening Event and the reason for such Adverse
Recommendation Change or the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the terms and conditions thereof (including a copy of any
proposed definitive agreements between the Company and the party making such Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments or
arrangements provided to the Company by the party making such Superior Proposal, in each case to be entered into in connection with such Superior
Proposal)), (II) during the three business days after the date of receipt by Parent of such notice (the “Negotiation Period”), the Company has negotiated,
and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such Negotiation Period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to
enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter such that it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or such that the Intervening Event no longer requires an Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, and (III) following the end of such Negotiation Period, the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly
authorized committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such binding offer, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect or such Intervening Event continues to
require an Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable; provided, however, that if during the Negotiation Period any revisions are made to the
Superior Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and agreed that any change to the consideration payable to the stockholders of
the Company in connection with such proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new notice to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.02(e) with respect to such new notice except that the references to three business days will be deemed to be two business days.
(f) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any
duly authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required
by applicable Law or if the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their duties to the Company or its stockholders under applicable
Law; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall, except as
expressly permitted by Section 5.02(e), effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.

the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof) or assets generating 20% or more of the consolidated revenues or net income of the Company

thereof), including through the acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company owning such assets, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would

Company or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which such Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) would acquire, directly or indirectly,

the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement and the
potential time delays and other risks to consummation associated with such offer) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account
all legal, regulatory, financial, financing and other aspects of such proposal and of this Agreement; provided that for purposes of the definition of
“Superior Proposal”, the references to “20%” in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.
(j) The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended as follows: the Company consents to any Financing Source constituting Parent’s
“Representative” (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).
SECTION 5.03. Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other
parties and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another
standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably

notices, petitions, statements, registrations, declarations, submissions of information, applications, reports and other documents, approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations or matters relating to Antitrust Laws or Investment Screening Laws, which are dealt with in
Sections 5.03(c) and (d) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.03(a) shall require any party to make any concessions (as
opposed to those matters dealt with in Sections 5.03(c) and (d) below, which are not the subject of this Section 5.03(a)).
(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would
cause the applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
lawfully minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.
(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make, or cause to be made, an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions (which shall request the early termination of any waiting period

business days following the date hereof, (ii) file, or make initial contact, with the relevant agency, as required under the applicable foreign Antitrust Laws
that are Other Regulatory Approvals in connection with the Merger Transactions, as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event by the first

promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by the Federal Trade Commission (the
“FTC”), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) or any other Governmental Authority pursuant to any Antitrust Law, Investment
Screening Law or Law with respect to a Required Approval. Each of the parties shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws or Investment Screening Laws or Law with
respect to a Required Approval that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the
Outside Date. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable take all actions necessary to (1) secure the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or, with respect to any Other Regulatory Approval, any other Antitrust Law or
Investment Screening Law, (2) obtain the Other Regulatory Approvals and (3) resolve any objections asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
applicable Law raised by any Governmental Authority, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Restraint
that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Transactions (the expirations, terminations, approvals and resolutions described in
clauses (1) through (3) or elsewhere in this Section 5.03(c), the “Required Approvals”), including (i) (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Authority or with any other Person, (B) selling, divesting or otherwise conveying or
holding separate particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (C) agreeing to sell, divest or otherwise convey or

or categories of assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Effective Time, (D) permitting
the Company to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any of the particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (E) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries, (F) terminating any joint venture or other arrangement, (G) creating any relationship, contractual right or obligation of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (H) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries (and, in each case, entering into agreements or stipulating to the entry of any Judgment by, or filing appropriate applications with, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing (any such action described or contemplated by this sentence or
elsewhere in this Section 5.03(c), other than the first sentence hereof, a “Remedial Action”) and, in the case of Remedial Actions by or with respect to the
Company, by consenting to such action by the Company (including any consents required under this Agreement with respect to such action); provided
that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company or Parent, be conditioned upon the Closing) and (ii) defending through litigation any claim
asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Restraint that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date (this clause (ii), “Regulatory Litigation”). No Remedial
Actions taken in accordance with and pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect
has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur. Parent shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any party to take or agree to take any
action with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. In connection
with the efforts described in this Section 5.03(c) and Sections 5.03(d) and 5.03(e), Parent shall have the right, in regular consultation with the Company
and after considering in good faith the Company’s views, to direct and control all such matters with any Governmental Authority consistent with its
obligations hereunder, including devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any such approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits,
authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions as well as the manner in which to
contest or otherwise respond to any objections or Actions challenging such approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders
or other confirmations. In connection with the efforts described in this Section 5.03(c) and Sections 5.03(d) and 5.03(e) to obtain the Required Approvals
as promptly as reasonably practicable, Parent shall have the right to a reasonable period in which to engage with Governmental Authorities and to
discuss any objections that a Governmental Authority raises with respect to the Transactions and in which to attempt in good faith to resolve, narrow or
overcome such objections, the extent of such reasonable period being dependent on the facts and circumstances but it being understood that it shall be
reasonable to continue such discussions and engagement during any review of the Transactions by such Governmental Authority provided in all cases
such discussions and engagement conclude at a time that, taking into account the period required to successfully defend any Regulatory Litigation, will
enable the parties to consummate the Merger prior to the Outside Date. For purposes hereof, “Antitrust Laws” means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,
the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, all applicable foreign antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition and “Investment Screening Laws” means applicable supranational, national, federal, state, provincial or local
Laws designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate investment made by any Person into business interests located in a foreign country.
(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
reasonable respects with each other in connection with any filing, submission or written communication with a Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions,
including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, and allow the other party to review in advance and consider in good faith the views of the other
party with respect to such filing, submission, or written communication, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely
 
A-35

basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority
(including by promptly sending the other parties a copy of all documents, information, correspondence or other written communications) and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii)
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other parties hereto with
respect to information relating to the other parties hereto and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third Person or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, and (iv) to the extent permitted by
the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other parties hereto the opportunity to attend and
participate in such substantive meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other side under this Section 5.03(d) as “Antitrust Counsel Only
Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel regarding Antitrust Law or Investment
Screening Law of the recipient and will not be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its
Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective counsel regarding Antitrust Law or Investment Screening Law to comply with this
Section 5.03(d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.03(d), materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged communications.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 5.03(c), (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall be obligated to take, proffer to, agree to, commit to, accept, or consent to, any Remedial Action if such Remedial Action, individually or
together with other Remedial Actions, would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or
financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger but
without giving effect to any Remedial Actions (with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, measured
for this purpose as being the same size and having the same financial position and results of operations as the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, prior to giving effect to the Merger and prior to giving effect to any Remedial Actions) (any such requirements, individually or in the aggregate, a
“Burdensome Condition”) and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take, proffer to, agree to, commit to, or consent to, any Remedial
Action.
(f) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective Subsidiaries shall not (i) effect or agree to any business combination
(whether structured as a merger, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) with the intention to, or that would reasonably
be expected to, prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR
Act or the obtaining of the approval of the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental Authority as necessary or (ii) subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement, including Section 5.03(e), take any other action with the intention to, or that would reasonably be expected to, prevent or delay the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of the approval of the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental Authority
such that the parties would be prevented from consummating the Merger prior to the Outside Date.
(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of Parent and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Financing shall be governed by Section
5.15 and not this Section 5.03.
SECTION 5.04. Public Announcements. Unless and until an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
 
A-36

consultation, except (a) as may be required by applicable Law, Judgment, court process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system, (b) any communications by Parent to any Financing Sources who are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions and (c) any matters referred to in Section 5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto (the “Announcement”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.04 shall not apply to any press release or other public statement made by Parent or the Company (i) which
is consistent with the Announcement and the terms of this Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the Company that has not been
previously announced or made public in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) is made in the ordinary course of business and does not
relate specifically to this Agreement or the Merger Transactions.
SECTION 5.05. Access to Information; Confidentiality; Transaction Consummation Team. 
(a) Subject to applicable Law and any applicable Judgment, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (i) afford to Parent and Parent’s Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the Company’s officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and records and (ii) furnish
promptly to Parent and Parent’s Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may
reasonably request, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), other than any information that the Company determines in its reasonable
judgment relates to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or, except as expressly provided in Section 5.02, to any Intervening Event, Takeover
Proposal or any other transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the Merger Transactions or proposals from other parties relating to any
competing or alternative transactions or relating to any deliberation of the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof
regarding any Takeover Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company; provided further, however, that (A) the Company shall
not be obligated to provide such access or information if doing so would reasonably be expected to (1) result in the disclosure of trade secrets or
competitively sensitive information to third parties (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives pursuant to any appropriate arrangement such as a clean team arrangement), (2) violate applicable Law, an applicable Judgment or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, disclosure to Parent and its Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives pursuant to a clean team arrangement), (3) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection or other legal privilege or (4) expose the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of personal information, provided that the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide such access or disclose such information in a manner that does not result in such a disclosure, violation, waiver or
exposure, (B) any physical access may be limited to the extent the Company determines in good faith that such limitation is necessary in light of COVID-
19 or any COVID-19 Measures, including if providing such access would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and (C) in no case shall Parent or its Representatives have the right to conduct any Phase II or other
environmental sampling or testing at any Company property. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. Until the Effective Time, all information provided (including information provided by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives pursuant to Section 5.15(e)) will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement dated
as of September 18, 2022 by and between the Company and Parent (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).
(b) Within 30 days of the date hereof, the Company shall designate one or more individuals as the individuals who will coordinate
responses to any requests by Parent under Section 5.05(a), including in connection with the integration planning of Parent; provided that the Company
may, from time to time, substitute such individuals or designate additional individuals, in its sole discretion.

SECTION 5.06. Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in each case to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, (i) jointly and severally indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an “Indemnitee” and, collectively, the “Indemnitees”) with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever or where ever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a representative
of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right
of any Indemnitee) and (ii) assume (in the case of the Surviving Corporation, in the Merger without any further action) all obligations of the Company and
such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless
otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of the
date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, without requiring a preliminary determination of entitlement to indemnification, advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.06 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this
Section 5.06) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.
(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the
Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those
Indemnitees who are currently (and any additional Indemnitees who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Company’s directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such Indemnitees than those
of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same
coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a “tail” policy); provided, that the maximum aggregate annual
premium for such insurance that Parent shall be required to expend shall not exceed 300% of the annual directors’ and officers’ insurance premium for the
Company’s then current fiscal year (the “D&O Cap”); and if such amount is not sufficient to purchase insurance in such maximum amount, then Parent
shall purchase such amount of insurance with the best coverage reasonably available as can be purchased for an aggregate amount that is equal to the
D&O Cap. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with its obligations under such policies for the full term of at least six (6) years. The
Company shall have the right, prior to the Effective Time, to purchase a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and conditions providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits as the applicable policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions, subject to the D&O Cap. If such
prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.06(b)
and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to
perform all of its obligations thereunder.

(c) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, or (ii) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.06.
(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.06 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.
(e) Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 5.06 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that if any claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an Indemnitee
on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the full and final resolution of
such claim.
(f) The provisions of this Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.06
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.06 applies and each Indemnitee’s heirs and
representatives shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.06).
SECTION 5.07. Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company Securities pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
SECTION 5.08. Employee Matters. (a) Subject to any applicable CBA, for a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target annual cash bonus and long-
term incentive opportunities to each person who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
“Continuing Employee”) that are, in each case, no less favorable than those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing
Employee under the applicable Company Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any provisions relating to a
“change in control”, “change of control” or other term of similar import) and (iii) other compensation and benefits (other than base salary, wage rate,
bonus and long-term incentive opportunities and change in control and severance benefits) to each Continuing Employee that have a value which is
substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits such Continuing Employee received immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, as applicable, assume, honor and continue in accordance with their terms all the Company Plans set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and continue for a period of
 
A-39

not less than one year following the Effective Time or, if later, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the employment, severance,
retention, termination and change in control plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any Company Plan providing for
severance in connection with a “change in control”, “change of control” or other term of similar import) maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, that are set forth on Section 5.08(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including with respect to any payments, benefits or
rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification, other than any
amendment or modification required to comply with applicable Law. Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions constitutes a
“change in control”, “change of control” or term of similar import for purposes of any Company Plan that contains such a term.
(c) With respect to all employee compensation or benefit plans, programs, agreements or arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries, including any “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement
subsidies, each Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be
treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or, with respect to Continuing
Employees located outside the United States (“Non-US Continuing Employees”), where such recognition is not permitted under the applicable employee
benefit plan.
(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, waive, or cause to be waived,
any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods (i) would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, or, (ii) with
respect to the Non-US Continuing Employees, cannot be waived under applicable Law or the terms of the applicable welfare plan. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.
(e) With respect to each Continuing Employee who is eligible to receive an annual bonus, as soon as administratively practicable, but in no
event later than five business days following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay such Continuing Employee a
pro rata bonus payment for the year in which the Closing Date occurs. Such bonuses shall be equal to the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs that have elapsed as of the Closing Date (including the Closing Date),
and the denominator of which is 365, and (ii) the amount of such Continuing Employee’s target bonus or, if greater, the bonus he or she would be entitled
to receive based on actual performance (as determined by the Company in accordance with past practice).
(f) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Company Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code (“Company DC Plans”) unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such Company Plans by providing
the Company with written notice of such election at least five days before the Effective Time. Unless Parent so provides notice to the Company, the
Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing Date, evidence that the
 
A-40
Table of Contents
Board of Directors of the Company has validly adopted resolutions to terminate such Company Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and taken all other actions necessary or
advisable to terminate such Company Plans, effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, in the
event that a Company DC Plan is terminated pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.08(f), Parent shall create or designate defined contribution
pension plans (collectively, the “Parent DC Plans”) for the benefit of the Continuing Employees who participated in such terminated Company DC Plans.
Such Continuing Employees are referred to hereinafter as the “DC Employees”. The DC Employees shall be given credit under the respective Parent DC
Plan for all service with and compensation from the Company and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors as if it were service with and
compensation from the Parent for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting under each respective Parent DC Plan. The applicable Parent DC Plans
shall be intended to be tax-qualified in the same manner as the corresponding Company DC Plans. Each Parent DC Plan will provide for the receipt in kind
of “eligible rollover distributions” (as such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code), including notes corresponding to a maximum of five loans per
participant, subject to the tax-qualified status of the Company DC Plans and other Parent DC Plan requirements for accepting “eligible rollover
distributions.” Parent and the Company shall cooperate in order to facilitate and, to the extent the Company DC Plans are determined to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code by the fiduciaries of the Parent DC Plans, effect an eligible rollover distribution for those DC Employees who timely elect to
rollover their account balances, including notes, directly into a Parent DC Plan.
(g) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. The
provisions of this Section 5.08 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or
following the Effective Time (including any Company Plans), (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
from amending or terminating any Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors or independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.08) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.
SECTION 5.09. Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) to the extent permitted under applicable Law, any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party
to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (b) any Actions commenced or, to such party’s
Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement or the Transactions.
The Company shall not settle or offer to settle any stockholder litigation against the Company or its officers or directors relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
SECTION 5.10. Parent Vote. (a) Parent shall vote or cause to be voted any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted, in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at
all adjournments or postponements thereof.

(b) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
SECTION 5.11. Stock Exchange De-listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Common Stock to be de-listed
from NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide all reasonable cooperation requested by Parent in connection therewith.
SECTION 5.12. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders’ Meeting. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, and subject to any injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting filing of the Proxy Statement, the Company shall prepare
the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and shall, no later than 20 business days after the date hereof, file it with the SEC. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. Unless the Company Board of Directors
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.02, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall make the Company Board Recommendation to the Company’s stockholders and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable if and to the extent such information shall
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all
written correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC
concerning the Proxy Statement and to resolve such comments with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to stockholders of the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after (i) if the Company does not receive comments from the
SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and does not reasonably believe that it will receive comments, the eleventh calendar day immediately
following the date of filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC and (ii) if the Company does receive comments from the SEC with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, clearance by the SEC with respect to such comments (the date in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, the “SEC Clearance
Date”). Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and to propose comments on such document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith.
(b) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change but subject to Section 5.12(a), the Company shall, in accordance with the
Company Charter Documents and the rules of NASDAQ, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournment, recess or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholders’ Meeting”) for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC Clearance Date. Unless the Company Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and shall cause
appropriate searches to be made in accordance with Rule 14a-13. The Company shall not change the record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting
without the prior written
 
A-42
Table of Contents
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may, in consultation with Parent, adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (i) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Company has determined is reasonably likely to
be required under applicable Law and for such supplement or amendment to be disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders of the Company in
advance of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, (ii) to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any proceedings in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or (iv) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company shall not adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Stockholders’ Meeting to a
date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the Company Stockholders’ Meeting was orginally scheduled without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (B) if Parent requests that the Company adjourn, postpone or recess
the Company Stockholders’ Meeting to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company will do
so.
(c) Unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.02, the Company shall keep Parent updated
with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent.
(d) Nothing in this Section 5.12 shall be deemed to prevent the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized
committee thereof from taking any action they are permitted or required to take under, and in compliance with, Section 5.02.
SECTION 5.13. Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. Parent shall cause each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to comply with all of its respective obligations under this Agreement, and Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature
except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall restrict Parent from transferring its
ownership in Merger Sub to another of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries that is treated as a regarded U.S. entity (or a disregarded U.S.
wholly owned Subsidiary thereof) for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent such transfer would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay, interfere with, hinder or impair the consummation of the Transactions on a timely basis.
SECTION 5.14. Company Indebtedness.
(a) Credit Agreement. The Company (x) will use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered at least two business days prior to the
Closing Date and (y) will deliver prior to the Closing, a payoff letter to Parent and all other releases, instruments of discharge and similar documentation
required to effect or evidence the release described in clause (ii) below (collectively, the “Payoff Letter”), in customary form, to be executed and delivered
as of the Closing by the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement (the “Existing Agent”), which shall (i) indicate the total amount necessary for
the Company to repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (other than for customary obligations
that expressly survive by their terms) (such amount, the “Payoff Amount”), (ii) provide for the release, upon payment of the Payoff Amount at Closing
(and replacement, cash collateralization or backstop of existing letters of credit), of all liens of the Existing Agent securing obligations under the Credit
Agreement over the properties and assets of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (other than any cash that is used to cash collateralize existing
letters of credit, if applicable) that constitute collateral under the Credit Agreement and (iii) provide for the termination or other satisfaction, upon
payment of the Payoff Amount at Closing (and replacement, cash collateralization or backstop of existing letters of credit), of all obligations under the
Credit Agreement (other than for customary obligations that expressly survive by their terms). Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent will repay and
discharge (or provide the funds to the Company to repay and discharge) such indebtedness in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

(b) Existing Notes.
(i) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request by
Parent to do so, the Company shall commence offers to purchase, and related consent solicitations to amend, eliminate or waive certain sections of
the Existing Indenture as specified by Parent (the “Consent Solicitations”), with respect to all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Existing Notes, on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms, that are reasonably proposed from time to time by Parent consistent with
this Section 5.14(b) (each a “Debt Tender Offer” and collectively, including the Consent Solicitations, the “Debt Tender Offers”) and Parent shall
assist the Company in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Tender Offer until
Parent shall have prepared and provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, consent solicitation
statement, supplemental indenture and other related documents in connection with such Debt Tender Offer (the “Debt Tender Offer Documents”);
provided, further, that Parent will consult with the Company regarding and afford the Company a reasonable time to review and comment on (A) the
timing and commencement of the Debt Tender Offers and any early tender or early consent deadlines for the Debt Tender Offers in light of the
regular financial reporting schedule of the Company and (B) the Debt Tender Offer Documents and the material terms and conditions of the Debt
Tender Offers and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company. The terms and conditions
specified by Parent for the Debt Tender Offers shall be in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law and the terms of the Existing Notes
and the Existing Indenture. The closing of each Debt Tender Offer shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time (and shall
occur immediately after the Effective Time), and the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause each Debt Tender Offer to close
immediately after the Effective Time and none of the Existing Notes shall be required to be purchased until immediately after the Effective Time;
provided, however, that if Parent (1) requests in writing that one or more Debt Tender Offers be consummated at or prior to the Effective Time and
(2) agrees to irrevocably and unconditionally pay for such Debt Tender Offers upon such consummation, then the parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause such Debt Tender Offers to be consummated as of the time so requested by Parent. The Company shall provide and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Tender Offers.
(ii) The Debt Tender Offers shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(“Rule 14e-1”), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “TIA”) and any other Law and the terms of the Existing Notes and the Existing Indenture, in
each case as applicable, it being understood that the Company shall not be required to take any action that does not comply in all material respects
with Rule 14e-1, the TIA or other applicable Law or the terms of the Existing Notes and the Existing Indenture. Promptly following the expiration of
the Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite consent from the holders of the Existing Notes (including from persons holding proxies from such
holders) has been received, the Company shall cause an appropriate supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to become effective
providing for the amendments to the Existing Indenture contemplated in the Debt Tender Offer Documents; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the fact that the Supplemental Indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth therein shall not
become operative unless and until the Effective Time has occurred and all conditions to the Debt Tender Offer have been satisfied or (subject to
approval by Parent) waived by the Company in accordance with the terms hereof. The form and substance of the Supplemental Indenture shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company.
(iii) The Company shall waive any of the conditions to any Debt Tender Offer as may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the
condition that each Debt Tender Offer is conditioned on the Effective Time occurring as provided in Section 5.14(b)(i)), so long as such waivers
would not cause any Debt Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the TIA or any other applicable Law or the terms of the Existing Notes or the
Existing Indenture, and shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to any Debt Tender Offer or make any change,
amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of any Debt Tender Offer (including any extension thereof) other than as agreed between
Parent and the Company or as required to comply with applicable Law.
 
A-44

(iv) If requested by Parent in writing, in addition to or lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for the Existing Notes, the Company shall (A)
(1) promptly deliver a notice with respect to a Change of Control Offer (as defined in the Existing Indenture) (“Change of Control Offer”) for the
repurchase, on and subject to the occurrence of a Change of Control Payment Date (as defined in the Existing Indenture) to be mutually agreed by
Parent and Company (which for the avoidance of doubt shall be on or following the Effective Time), all of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Existing Notes, pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Existing Indenture, and (2) otherwise comply with the Existing Indenture with respect to
each such Change of Control Offer, or (B) take any actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and/or discharge of such
Existing Notes by the Surviving Corporation on or following the Effective Time pursuant to Article VIII of the Existing Indenture. If requested by
Parent in writing, the Company shall assist Parent with the preparation of the documents required by Article V of the Existing Indenture in
connection with the consummation of the Merger.
(v) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and

Transaction Tax Matters Agreement), in each case, on an after-tax basis, suffered or incurred by them in connection with any act or omission
relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 5.14(b); provided, however, that Parent shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless any such party or Person to the extent any such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgment, penalties

SECTION 5.15. Financing. (a) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or any termination
of, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Letters, in each case, without the Company’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, including by changing the amount of fees or original issue discount payable pursuant to the Financing Letters,
below the Required Amount (after taking into account cash on hand of Parent and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably expected to be available at the
Closing to pay the Required Amount and other committed funds available to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with conditions to funding no more onerous
than those conditions to funding contained in the Debt Commitment Letter whereupon such other committed funding source shall be deemed to also be
“Debt Financing” and the documentation in respect thereof shall be deemed to be a “Financing Letter” and a “Debt Commitment Letter”), (ii) impose new
or additional conditions to the Debt Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Debt Financing in a manner that would
be more onerous than those conditions to funding contained in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof, (iii) adversely affect the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto or (iv) prevent or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the Transactions. Upon any such amendment,
supplement or other modification of the Financing Letters in accordance with this Section 5.15(a), the terms “Financing Letters”, “Debt Commitment
Letter” and/or “Fee Letters”, as applicable, shall mean the Financing Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the Fee Letters, as the case may be, as
so amended, supplemented or modified.

Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter), (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including by causing the Debt Financing Sources to

into account cash on hand that is reasonably expected to be available at the Closing to pay the Required Amount and/or other committed funds available
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with conditions to funding no more onerous than those conditions to funding contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter whereupon such other committed funding source shall be deemed to also be “Debt Financing” and the documentation in respect thereof shall be
deemed to be a “Financing Letter” and a “Debt Commitment Letter”), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (A) in an amount
sufficient to enable it to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account cash on hand that is reasonably expected to be available at the Closing to
pay the Required Amount and/or other committed funds available to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with conditions to funding no more onerous than
those conditions to funding contained in the Debt Commitment Letter whereupon such other committed funding source shall be deemed to also be “Debt
Financing” and the documentation in respect thereof shall be deemed to be a “Financing Letter” and a “Debt Commitment Letter”), (B) with terms not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof, (C) which does not contain
any condition to funding that would be more onerous than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof and (D) which would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the debt financing thereunder beyond the Closing Date (the “Alternate Financing”), and
(ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Financing (each, a “New Commitment Letter”), in each case which
New Commitment Letter(s) will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a correct
and complete copy of any New Commitment Letter, together with any related exhibits, schedules, supplements and term sheets, and a correct and
complete copy of any fee letter in connection therewith (it being understood that such letter will be redacted in a customary manner). In the event that
any New Commitment Letter is obtained, (1) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Letters”, “Debt Commitment Letter” or the “Fee Letters”
shall mean the Financing Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the Fee Letters, as the case may be, to the extent not superseded by one or more
New Commitment Letters (and/or any related fee letter(s)) at the time in question, and any New Commitment Letter (and/or any related fee letter(s)) to the
extent then in effect, and (2) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing” will mean the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the foregoing.
(c) Parent shall (i) keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing or any applicable Alternate Financing, and (ii) promptly provide the Company with copies of all executed amendments, modifications

Parent shall promptly notify the Company of (A) any breach (or

breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing, (B) the receipt by Parent of any oral or
written notice or communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or
such definitive agreements, (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing or (3) failure by a party to the Debt Commitment Letter to fund any part of the Debt Financing, and (C) the occurrence
of an event or development that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (or if at any time for any other reason Parent or Merger Sub believes that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by any of the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing).
(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parent’s or Merger Sub’s consummation of any financing
arrangement, Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any financing (including the Debt Financing or any Alternate Financing) or the availability, grant, provision
or extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub (including the Debt Financing or any Alternate Financing).

Representatives, including management, legal and accounting Representatives, to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best
efforts to provide, customary cooperation and assistance to Parent and Merger Sub in arranging, underwriting, obtaining, syndicating and consummating
the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub and in that regard shall: (i) cause members of senior management of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to participate in a reasonable number (taking into account the nature of the Financing) of meetings (including customary one-on-one
meetings and conference calls with the parties acting as lead arrangers, agents, underwriters or initial purchasers and prospective lenders or investors)
and conference calls with the Debt Financing Sources and prospective lenders and purchasers of the Financing, rating agency sessions, presentations,
road shows and due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), and cooperating reasonably with the marketing efforts of Parent

and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (but not prior to the Effective Time) of any pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging

Sources (provided, that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement shall be effective until the
Effective Time) and otherwise reasonably cooperate to facilitate the identification, pledging and granting of security interests in, and obtaining perfection

fines, claims, losses, penalties, damages, interest, awards, liabilities or obligations directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any such person or entity
in connection with any act or omission relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 5.15, in each case, except for any such losses and other

public information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, which information is necessary or customary to include in such an offering memorandum
or other marketing materials for the Financing and Parent reasonably determines (and the Company does not reasonably object on the basis that the

Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives pursuant to Section 5.05(b) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality

principal cause of the failure of one of its conditions to Closing in Section 6.01 to be satisfied, that party shall not assert in a proceeding for damages

thereof; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such legal proceeding in any other court; (iii) to

the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such legal proceeding in any such court; and (iv) any such legal proceeding will be
governed by, construed in accordance with and enforced under the laws of the State of New York (except as otherwise specified in the Debt Commitment

them hereunder to consummate this Agreement and the Transactions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an

they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 7.03 (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm
that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to
specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
