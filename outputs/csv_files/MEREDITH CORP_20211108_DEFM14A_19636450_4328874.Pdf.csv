as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement as it is the legal document that governs the Merger.
Meredith Corporation (page 43). Meredith is an Iowa corporation that operates two business segments: national media group (comprising its Digital
and Magazine reporting segments) (“NMG”) and local media group (“LMG”). Our NMG segment includes leading national consumer media brands
delivered via multiple media platforms, including print magazines, digital and mobile media, brand licensing activities, database-related activities,
affinity marketing, and business-to-business marketing products and services. Most of our brands are also available as digital editions on one or
more of the major digital newsstands and on major tablet devices. The NMG segment’s extensive digital presence consists of 50 websites and
applications (apps). The NMG segment also includes brand licensing activities, affinity marketing, third-party marketing, an extensive consumer
database, and other related operations. Our LMG segment consists of 17 television stations located across the U.S. concentrated in fast-growing
markets with related digital and mobile media assets. The television stations include seven CBS affiliates, five FOX affiliates, two MyNetworkTV
affiliates, one NBC affiliate, one ABC affiliate, and two independent stations. LMG’s digital presence includes 12 websites and 12 apps focused on
news, sports, and weather-related information. In addition, the LMG segment sells geographically and demographically targeted advertising
programs to third parties.
Gray Television, Inc. and Gray Hawkeye Stations, Inc. (page 43). Gray is a television broadcast company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and is
the largest owner of top-rated local television stations and digital assets in the United States. Upon completion of the Merger transaction with
Meredith, Gray will become the nation’s second largest television broadcaster, with television stations serving 113 markets that reach approximately
36 percent of US television households. The pro forma portfolio includes 79 markets with the top-rated television station and 101 markets with the
first and/or second highest rated television station according to Comscore’s audience measurement data. Gray also owns video program production,
marketing, and digital businesses including Raycom Sports, Tupelo Honey, and RTM Studios, the producer of PowerNation programs and content
and is the majority owner of Swirl Films. Merger Sub is a newly formed Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gray that has been
formed specifically for the purpose of participating in the Merger transaction with Meredith.
Meredith Holdings Corporation (page 43). Meredith Holdings Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Meredith (referred to as “NMG SpinCo”),
is an Iowa corporation that was formed on April 29, 2021 and whose shares will be distributed by Meredith on a one-for-one basis to Meredith
shareholders, maintaining the existing dual-class voting structure pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement (as defined below). Following the separation transfers, which are described further beginning on page 50, NMG SpinCo will be comprised
of the subsidiaries, assets, liabilities and employees of the corporate and NMG business segments, as well as Meredith’s MNI and People TV
businesses. Upon completion of the Spin-Off and Merger transactions, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day as the Merger,
NMG SpinCo

organized into two reporting segments (Digital and Magazine); remain headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa; be led by Meredith’s existing senior
executive team with Tom Harty as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and would continue trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
under the ticker symbol “MDP”.

A copy of the Merger Agreement and copies of (i) the Separation and Distribution Agreement, by and among Meredith, Gray and NMG SpinCo,
dated as of May 3, 2021, as amended May 18, 2021 and June 2, 2021 (which second amendment superseded the first in all material respects) (as the
same may be further amended from time to time, the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”), (ii) the Employee Matters Agreement, by and
among Meredith, Gray and NMG SpinCo, dated as of May 3, 2021 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Employee Matters
Agreement”), (iii) the Tax Matters Agreement, by and among Meredith, Gray and NMG SpinCo, dated as of May 3, 2021 (as the same may be

dated as of May 3, 2021, as amended September 30, 2021 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Transition Services Agreement”, and
together with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement, the “Spin-Off
Agreements”) are attached as Annexes D to G to this proxy statement. The Merger Agreement, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the
Employee Matters Agreement and the Merger Agreement were further amended by the Amendment and Consent, by and among Meredith, NMG
SpinCo, Gray, Merger Sub, and Dotdash, dated as of October 6, 2021 (the “Consent Agreement”), which is attached as Annex H to this proxy
statement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Consent Agreement, the Consent Agreement affirms Gray’s consent to Meredith’s and NMG
SpinCo’s execution, delivery and performance of the Dotdash Merger Agreement for all purposes under the Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off
Agreements. Among other things, the Consent Agreement provides that the Dotdash Merger cannot occur prior to the completion of the Merger
(or, if earlier, the termination of the Merger Agreement). The Consent Agreement also provides for certain adjustments to the Target Net Debt
Amount (as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and described below), which have the effect of increasing the amount of the
SpinCo Cash Payment. The final amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment does not affect or reduce the $16.99 cash payment per share to be received in
the Gray Merger.
Meredith encourages you to read the entire agreements carefully because they are the principal documents governing the transactions, including
the Separation, Distribution, Spin-Off (as described below) and Merger. For more information on the transaction agreements, see “Proposal 1”
below, beginning on page 50.
Transaction Steps
Step 1. Separation.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at a time on or prior to the date of the Distribution (as defined below), Meredith
will cause (1) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the NMG business segment, the MNI and People
TV businesses and the corporate functions of Meredith to be transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be assumed by, NMG SpinCo
and (2) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the LMG business segment to be retained by or
transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be retained by or assumed by, Meredith (collectively, the “Separation”). Following the
Separation, NMG SpinCo and its subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while Meredith (excluding NMG
SpinCo and its subsidiaries) will own all of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).
2Table of Contents
Step 2. SpinCo Cash Payment and Repayment of Meredith Debt.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, prior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make a
cash payment (referred to as the “SpinCo Cash Payment”) to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith (exclusive of any NMG SpinCo debt and
after giving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by
Meredith and Gray to be allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off (as described below)). The proceeds of the SpinCo
Cash Payment, together with cash on hand of Meredith and borrowings by Gray, will be used to satisfy all of Meredith’s outstanding long-term debt
as of the date of the closing of the Merger. The SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on
hand (which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit
facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing (as defined below) or, if the Dotdash Merger (as defined below) is completed on the same day as the closing
of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.
Step 3. Distribution and Spin-Off.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will
consummate a spin off of NMG SpinCo by distributing (the “Distribution”) (i) the shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of NMG
SpinCo (“NMG SpinCo Common Stock”) to Meredith shareholders holding Meredith Common Stock, and (ii) the shares of Class B Common Stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of NMG SpinCo (“NMG SpinCo Class B Stock”) to Meredith shareholders holding Meredith Class B Stock, in each case
on a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will maintain Meredith’s existing dual-class voting structure (collectively, the “Spin-Off”). Prior to
completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and a date for the Distribution to occur (the “Distribution Date”). Meredith
expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is completed, but the record date for the Distribution (the
“Distribution Record Date”) will be an earlier date.
After the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per
share with respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote; the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten
votes per share on such matters; NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by pre-merger Meredith shareholders;
and NMG SpinCo is expected to retain the “Meredith” name and “MDP” ticker symbol.
Step 4. Merger.
The Merger (page 50). Under the Merger Agreement, immediately after the consummation of the Spin-Off, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Meredith, and Meredith will be the surviving corporation in the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”), Gray will own all
outstanding shares of capital stock of Meredith. Our shareholders will receive cash in the Merger in exchange for their shares of Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock. This cash will be in addition to the shares of NMG SpinCo that our shareholders will receive pursuant to the
Distribution.
Merger Consideration (page 104). If the Merger is completed, you will receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax
withholding (the “Merger Consideration”), in exchange for each share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock that you own
unless, in the case of Meredith Class B Stock, you have properly demanded (and not withdrawn or lost) your appraisal rights under Iowa law.
Additionally, immediately prior to and as a condition to the Merger, you will receive one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for each share of
Meredith Common Stock, and one share of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class B Stock, that you hold as of the
Distribution Record Date. After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have
any ongoing ownership interest in the continuing LMG business of Meredith.

Dotdash Merger (page 51). On October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of October 6, 2021, by and among Dotdash Media Inc. (formerly known as About, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (“Dotdash”),
Meredith, NMG SpinCo and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, IAC/InterActiveCorp, a Delaware corporation (“IAC”) (the “Dotdash
Merger Agreement”) to sell NMG SpinCo (which will consist of NMG, the MNI and People TV businesses, and corporate operations at the time of
the acquisition) to Dotdash, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC, which we refer to as the “Dotdash Merger”. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is
not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, and for so long as the Merger Agreement is in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not,
pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the Closing of the Merger. We currently expect the Dotdash Merger to be consummated on the
same day as and following the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger, if the closing conditions for the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied
or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Spin-Off and the Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone,
publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement, unless the Dotdash Merger is
terminated earlier. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the LMG business and, until the
Dotdash Merger is completed, NMG, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain
amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash
Merger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo
and by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote
required for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the
Dotdash Merger.
If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as
provided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock. The cash payment received by NMG SpinCo shareholders will be
in addition to the cash Merger Consideration that Meredith shareholders will receive if the Merger is completed.
For more information regarding the Dotdash Merger, the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the consideration that shareholders will receive in respect
of the shares of NMG SpinCo that will have previously been received by Meredith shareholders in the Spin-Off, see the Company’s Form 8-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2021.

Merger
Upon the completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), RSU and Share Based Award
granted under Meredith’s equity plans will be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Gray an amount of cash equal to $16.99 per share
(or in the case of stock options, the excess, if any, of $16.99 over the exercise price of such option, as adjusted in connection with the Spin-Off as
described below), without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding. See also “The Merger—Treatment of Equity Awards” beginning on
page 86.
Spin-Off
Options. Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, each outstanding stock option granted under Meredith’s equity plans
will be converted into two options: (1) an adjusted Company stock option that will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment in the Merger as described above, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares. The number of shares subject to the adjusted Company
4Table of Contents
stock option and the NMG SpinCo stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Company stock option prior to the Spin-
Off, but the exercise prices will be adjusted to reflect the relative values of LMG and NMG. The NMG SpinCo stock options will generally be subject
to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related Company stock option award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo
stock options held by employees of LMG will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the
excess, if any, of the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date
(or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the
Dotdash Merger Agreement) less the adjusted exercise price for such option. See also “The Employee Matters Agreement—Treatment of Equity
Awards” beginning on page 130.
RSUs and Share-Based Awards. Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of outstanding restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) and other share-based awards (each a “Share-Based Award”) granted under Meredith’s equity plans will receive RSUs and Share-Based
Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares subject to the related Company award prior to the Spin-Off. The NMG SpinCo
RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related Company award before the
Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the
Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common
Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement). See also “The Employee Matters Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards” beginning on page 130.
Market for Meredith Common Stock; Dividend Data (page 138). Shares of Meredith Common Stock are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol
“MDP.” On April 30, 2021, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed Merger, shares of Meredith Common Stock
closed at $31.10 per share. On November 5, 2021, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, shares of Meredith
Common Stock closed at $58.20 per share. Our stock price can fluctuate broadly even over short periods of time. It is impossible to predict the actual
price of our stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, each holder of Meredith Common Stock or
Meredith Class B Stock will receive (i) $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding, in respect of each share held and
(ii) as a result of the Distribution, one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Meredith Common Stock and one share of NMG
SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class B Stock, as further described herein. We historically declared and paid regular dividends on
our capital stock but paused such dividends in 2020 as one of several actions taken to strengthen Meredith’s liquidity and enhance Meredith’s
financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the Merger is completed, you will no longer be eligible to receive dividends from
Meredith. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger transactions, you will be eligible to
receive dividends from NMG SpinCo, to the extent NMG SpinCo declares such dividends and you continue to hold NMG SpinCo Stock pending
completion of the Dotdash Merger; however, pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement, NMG SpinCo is prohibited from issuing dividends
without consent of Dotdash for so long as the Dotdash Merger Agreement remains in effect. Please see “Market for Meredith Common Stock;
Dividend Data” beginning on page 138 for further detail.
Reasons for the Transaction and Reasons for the Recommendation of Our Board (page 51). In the course of reaching its decision to approve the
Merger and the Merger Agreement, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) considered possible alternative transactions involving us, as well as the
Merger described in this proxy statement, and considered a number of factors in its deliberations. Please see “The Merger—Reasons for the
Transaction and Reasons for the Recommendation of Our Board” beginning on page 51 for a description of the factors considered.

Table of Contents
Opinion of Meredith’s Financial Advisor (page 77). Our Board retained Moelis & Company LLC (“Moelis”) as its financial advisor in connection
with the potential sale of Meredith’s LMG business segment. At the May 3, 2021 meeting of the Board, Moelis rendered its oral opinion to the
Board, confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion dated May 3, 2021, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, of
the consideration of $14.51 per share in cash (as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2021 (for purposes of this section, the
“Original Agreement”), and before its amendment, dated as of June 2, 2021) to be received in the Merger by the holders of Meredith Common Stock
and Meredith Class B Stock (other than E.T. Meredith, IV and D. Mell Meredith Frazier, who are party to the Support Agreement, Parent, Merger
Sub, any other subsidiary of Parent, the Company and any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the “Excluded Holders”)).
The full text of Moelis’ written opinion dated May 3, 2021, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by
reference. Moelis’ opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the Board (solely in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Merger. Moelis’
opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the holders of the Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock (other than the Excluded Holders) pursuant to the Original Agreement and does not address the Company’s
underlying business decision to effect the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or
transactions that might be available to the Company. Moelis’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of securities
should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Meredith’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 77 and attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement.
Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors (page 85). Our Board has unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interest of Meredith and its shareholders, (b)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by Meredith of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger and (c) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of Meredith approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
thereby approve the Merger. Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby
approve the Merger, “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive
in connection with the Merger, and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if
there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 85). In considering the unanimous recommendation of our Board to vote in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that the consummation of the Merger will result in certain benefits to our
directors and executive officers that are not available to our shareholders generally. Meredith’s Board was aware of these interests during its
deliberations on the merits of the Merger and in deciding to recommend that Meredith shareholders vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement
at the Special Meeting. These benefits include:
•
continued employment with NMG SpinCo or with Gray, as applicable;
•
cash out of certain equity awards;
•
receipt of new NMG SpinCo equity awards; and
•
eligibility to receive severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations.

In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, Gray entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the “Support Agreement”) with certain
Company shareholders, who collectively control 1.7% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Common Stock and approximately 89.3% of the
issued and outstanding Meredith Class B Stock (representing approximately 50.3% of the voting power when voting together as a single class) as of
the Record Date (as defined below). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, such shareholders agreed to vote their Meredith Common Stock and
Meredith Class B Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal (as defined below) and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Please see “The Merger—Voting and Support Agreement” beginning on page 91 for additional information regarding the Support Agreement.
Appraisal Rights (page 92). Pursuant to the Iowa Business Corporation Act (the “IBCA”), the holder of each share of Meredith Class B Stock is
entitled to rights of appraisal under Section 490.1302 of the IBCA, in connection with the Merger with respect to their Meredith Class B Stock. This
right of appraisal is subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements, as further described herein. Holders of Meredith Common Stock
are not entitled to appraisal rights under the IBCA in connection with the transaction with respect to those shares.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, shareholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Meredith Class B Stock are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel and financial advisors with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Shareholders considering seeking appraisal should be
aware that the fair value of their Meredith Class B Stock as determined pursuant to the IBCA could be greater than, the same as or less than the
value of the Merger Consideration.
Please see “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 92 for additional information regarding appraisal rights for holders of Meredith
Class B Stock and Annex C for a copy of the IBCA provisions governing such appraisal rights.
Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution the Merger and the Dotdash Merger (page 95).
In general, the receipt of shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock (collectively, “NMG SpinCo Stock”) by you in the
Distribution, the receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock pursuant to the Merger,
and, if the Dotdash Merger is completed, the receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares of NMG SpinCo Stock will be taxable transactions
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt by you of shares of NMG SpinCo Stock in the Distribution will generally be a taxable dividend in an
amount equal to the fair market value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received to the extent of your ratable share of Meredith’s current and accumulated
earnings and profits, with the excess treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in shares of Meredith Common
Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, and then as capital gain. Generally, in the Merger you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between the total amount of cash you receive in the Merger for your shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B
Stock and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference,
if any, between the total amount of cash you receive in the Dotdash Merger for your shares of NMG SpinCo Stock and your adjusted tax basis in
such shares, which gain or loss may be equal to zero.
You should read “The Merger—Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution and the Merger and the Dotdash
Merger” beginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of certain material

U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the Distribution and the
Merger to you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your own tax advisor to understand fully the tax consequences
of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger to you.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 99). The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR
Act”), prohibits us from completing the Merger until we have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and any required waiting period under the HSR Act (and
any extension thereof) has expired or been terminated. Both Meredith and Gray made filings under the HSR Act on May 14, 2021. On June 14, 2021,
Meredith and Gray each received a Request for Additional Information (a “Second Request”) from the Antitrust Division, which defines the
“Relevant Area” as the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan Designated Market Area (“DMA”) and the “Relevant Product” as “the sale of spot
advertising time on broadcast television stations.” The issuance of a Second Request extends the waiting period until thirty calendar days after
Meredith and Gray comply with the Second Request or until the Antitrust Division terminates the waiting period. On July 14, 2021, Gray announced
an agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA to Allen Media Broadcasting, LLC (“Allen Media”). On
September 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of WJRT-TV. On September 23, 2021,
Gray consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in the same DMA. The Antitrust
Division informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8, 2021, the waiting period
under the HSR Act was terminated.
In addition, consent from the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) to transfer control of Meredith and the broadcast licensee
subsidiaries of Meredith is required prior to completing the Merger. Meredith and Gray filed applications for FCC consent on May 14, 2021, and the
FCC issued a public notice accepting the applications and establishing a comment cycle on May 26, 2021. One viewer filed comments that are not
specific to the proposed transaction, and Gray and Meredith jointly filed a response to the comment. Also, a company that sells outdoor television
antennas filed an Informal Objection; Request for Condition (the “Objection”) proposing that the FCC impose a condition on its approval of the
transaction requiring Gray to accept reasonable advertisement requests from vendors of over-the-air antennas. Meredith and Gray responded to the
Objection and asked the FCC to process the transaction without delay. To facilitate regulatory approvals for the Merger, Gray agreed to divest
WJRT-TV in the Flint-Saginaw DMA, the only market in which both Gray and Meredith operate stations. On July 14, 2021, Gray announced an
agreement to divest WJRT-TV pursuant to an agreement with Allen Media Broadcasting, LLC (“Allen Media”). On July 23, 2021, Gray filed an
application seeking consent to assign the license for WJRT-TV to Allen Media. On July 27, 2021, the FCC issued a public notice accepting the
application and establishing August 26, 2021 as the deadline for filing petitions to deny. The FCC granted the WJRT-TV assignment application on

votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger. The Special Meeting will be held at 10:00
a.m., Central Standard Time, on November 30, 2021. The Special Meeting will be held in virtual format only. You will be able to attend the Special
Meeting online, during which you can vote your shares, by visiting www.proxydocs.com/MDP. Registration online at www.proxydocs.com/MDP is

Record Date and Voting Power. You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B
Stock at the close of business on November 15, 2021, the record date for the Special Meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote at the
Special Meeting for each share of Meredith Common Stock and ten votes for each share of Meredith Class B Stock you owned at the close of
business on the Record Date. As of November 5, 2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our shareholders,
there were 40,741,018.173 shares of Meredith Common Stock and 5,060,957 shares of Meredith Class B Stock entitled to be voted at the Special
Meeting. The Record Date, which determines your eligibility to vote on the proposals set forth herein, is distinct from the Distribution Record Date,
which determines your eligibility to receive NMG SpinCo Common Stock or NMG SpinCo Class B Stock, as applicable, in connection with the Spin-
Off, as further described herein.
Procedure for Voting. To vote, you can (a) complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card, (b) appoint a proxy over the Internet or by
telephone or (c) virtually attend the Special Meeting and vote by visiting www.proxydocs.com/MDP. Registration online at
www.proxydocs.com/MDP is required for attendance. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should
instruct your broker to vote your shares by following the instructions provided by your broker. Your broker will not vote your shares without
instruction from you. Failure to instruct your broker to vote your shares will mean that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, but, should quorum be met and the vote take place, your shares will not be counted as votes
cast on the proposals and therefore will have no effect on the results of the vote.
Required Vote.
•
The proposal to adopt of the Merger Agreement, and thereby approve the Merger (the “Merger Proposal”), requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of (a) a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Meredith Common Stock, voting as a
single class, (b) a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Meredith Class B Stock, voting as a single
class and (c) a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B
Stock, voting together as a single class (“Company Shareholder Approval”), in each case, entitled to vote thereon at the close of
business on the Record Date.
•
The proposal to consider and vote, on an advisory basis, upon a proposal to approve the compensation that Meredith’s named
executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger (the “Compensation Proposal”), requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote thereon at the close of business on the Record Date.
•
The proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the
time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Adjournment Proposal”), requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote thereon at the close of business on the Record Date.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for such purposes and therefore will have no effect on the results of the vote
on these proposals (though such abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present).
Broker non-votes are shares held in “street name” by the beneficial owner of the shares and for which no instruction has been given to the broker
on how to vote the shares, and the broker then does not vote the shares because the broker does not have the discretionary authority to do so.

Separation and Distribution Agreement (page 126)",18,20
MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Separation and Distribution Agreement,"Separation and Distribution Agreement (page 126)
The Separation and Distribution Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions on which the Distribution and Spin-Off will be consummated and the
allocation of assets and liabilities between NMG SpinCo and post-Closing Meredith (excluding NMG SpinCo and its subsidiaries, “LMG
RemainCo”).
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at a time on or prior to the Distribution Date, Meredith will complete the Separation by
causing (1) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the NMG business segment, the MNI and People
TV businesses and the corporate functions of Meredith to be transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be assumed by, NMG SpinCo
and (2) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the LMG business segment to be retained by or
transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be retained by or assumed by, Meredith, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Following
the Separation, NMG SpinCo and its subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while LMG RemainCo will own
all of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, prior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make the
SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith (exclusive of the NMG SpinCo debt and after giving effect to the SpinCo Cash
Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by Meredith and Gray to be allocated to
Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The proceeds of the SpinCo Cash Payment, together with cash on hand of Meredith and
borrowings by Gray, will be used to satisfy all of Meredith’s outstanding long-term debt as of the date of the closing of the Merger. The SpinCo
Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand (which will be taken into account in
12Table of Contents
determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing or,
if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection
with the Dotdash Merger.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will
consummate the Spin-Off by making the Distribution of (i) the shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock to Meredith shareholders holding Meredith
Common Stock, and (ii) the shares of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock to Meredith shareholders holding Meredith Class B Stock, in each case on a one-
for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will maintain Meredith’s existing dual-class voting structure. Prior to completion of the Merger, Meredith will
set the Distribution Record Date and the Distribution Date. Meredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger
is completed, but the Distribution Record Date will be an earlier date.
After the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per
share with respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote; the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten
votes per share on such matters; NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by pre-merger Meredith shareholders;
and NMG SpinCo is expected to retain the “Meredith” name and “MDP” ticker symbol.
Completion of the Distribution and Spin-Off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger (other than
those conditions that by their nature are satisfied at the closing). Completion of the Distribution and Spin-Off is also subject to the consummation of
the SpinCo Debt Financing (except that, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, this condition can be satisfied without full funding of the SpinCo Debt
Financing to the extent the Dotdash Merger closes on the same day as the Spin-Off and the Merger and the SpinCo Cash Payment is fully paid
through funds advanced by Dotdash, subject to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement), payment of the SpinCo Cash Payment,
effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form 10 regarding NMG SpinCo Stock, receipt by the Company and NMG SpinCo of a solvency
opinion, the acceptance of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for listing on the NYSE, the absence of an injunction or law preventing the consummation
of the transactions (including the Distribution and the Merger) and other customary closing conditions.

The Employee Matters Agreement governs the rights and obligations of Meredith, Gray and NMG SpinCo with respect to Meredith employees and
employee benefit plans in connection with the Spin-Off. The Employee Matters Agreement generally provides that (1) Meredith’s NMG, MNI,
People TV and corporate employees and associated liabilities will be assumed by NMG SpinCo and (2) Meredith’s other LMG employees and
associated liabilities will be retained by LMG RemainCo, subject to the specific terms and conditions of the Employee Matters Agreement. The
Employee Matters Agreement generally provides that NMG SpinCo will assume sponsorship of certain Meredith benefit plans and assume certain
liabilities after the Distribution for certain LMG employees.

MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Financing of the Transactions,"Financing of the Transactions (page 100)
NMG SpinCo
Meredith anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately $45 million, in addition to
the funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith, which will be approximately $625 million, which amount is
subject to adjustment as further described in this proxy statement. This amount is expected to be funded through the following sources: available
cash on hand (which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior
credit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger,
through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.
To provide the debt financing required by Meredith to fund the SpinCo Cash Payment, Meredith entered into a commitment letter (the “Existing
SpinCo Commitment Letter”), dated June 25, 2021 (amending and restating its financing commitment letter dated May 3, 2021, as amended and
restated May 24, 2021), with Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse AG, and the other lenders party thereto (the “Initial
Lenders”). In connection with entering into the Dotdash Merger Agreement, and to facilitate the SpinCo Cash Payment obligations of Meredith
(should the Dotdash Merger not be completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger), Meredith (i) terminated the Existing
SpinCo Commitment Letter and (ii) entered into a replacement commitment letter (the “SpinCo Commitment Letter”) with Royal Bank and Barclays
(collectively, the “Commitment Parties”) on October 6, 2021, pursuant to which Meredith has received commitments from the Commitment Parties to
provide to NMG SpinCo $725 million of secured term loans pursuant to a term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and $150 million of secured
revolving commitments (the “Revolving Facility” and collectively, the “Facilities”). The borrower under the Facilities will be a designated
subsidiary of NMG SpinCo and the obligations of the borrower will be guaranteed by NMG SpinCo and the subsidiaries of the borrower (subject to
customary exceptions to be agreed). The amount of initial borrowings under the Facilities will be determined prior to the closing date of the Merger
based on the total amount of funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith (which, in turn, will depend on the
actual amount of Meredith’s net debt on the closing date of the Merger) and to pay transaction fees and expenses.
The obligation of Meredith and Gray to consummate the Merger is subject to completion of the Distribution and Spin-Off. The obligation of
Meredith to consummate the Distribution and Spin-Off is subject to the consummation and funding of the Facilities in accordance with the SpinCo
Commitment Letter (the “SpinCo Debt Financing”) and payment of the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith in accordance with the Separation and
Distribution Agreement.
14Table of Contents
Funding of the Facilities is subject to customary conditions, including the negotiation of definitive documentation for the Facilities, that no material
adverse effect on the financial condition, business or operations of NMG SpinCo has occurred and other customary closing conditions consistent
with the Merger Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
Gray
Gray anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to finance the transactions and to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately
$2.89 billion. This amount is expected to be funded through one or more of the following sources: available cash on hand, the issuance and sale by
Gray of notes in a public offering or in a Rule 144A private placement, and borrowings under the Gray term loan facility and bridge facility as
described below.
To provide the debt financing required by Gray to consummate the Merger, Gray has entered into a financing commitment letter (the “Gray
Commitment Letter”), dated June 2, 2021 (amending and restating its financing commitment letter, dated May 3, 2021) with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association and the other lenders party thereto, pursuant to which the lenders have committed to provide the debt financing for a portion
of the purchase price to be paid to complete the Merger and the satisfaction of certain existing indebtedness of Meredith, with an incremental term
loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion and a bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.475 billion less the principal
amount of any notes issued prior to the date of completion of the Merger. The funding under the Gray Commitment Letter is subject to customary
conditions for commitments of this type. While the obligation of Gray to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition, the Gray
Commitment Letter includes a customary marketing period, and, without Gray’s and Meredith’s agreement, the closing of the Merger will not occur
earlier than (i) December 1, 2021 or (ii) the completion of the marketing period (unless the marketing period is scheduled to be completed after
December 30, 2021, in which event the closing of the Merger will occur on December 30, 2021).

Commitment Letter.

The Merger is currently expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot
occur earlier than (i) December 1, 2021 or (ii) the completion of the marketing period under the Gray Commitment Letter (unless such marketing period
is scheduled to be completed after December 30, 2021, in which event the Closing will occur on December 30, 2021), in each case unless otherwise
agreed by Meredith, Gray and Merger Sub. However, neither Meredith nor Gray can predict the actual date on which the Merger will be completed,
nor can Meredith or Gray be certain that the Merger will be completed, because completion is subject to conditions beyond the control of Meredith
and Gray.

The following pro forma condensed financial statements reflect adjustments to Meredith’s historical financial information to depict the sale of LMG
to a subsidiary of Gray. As described elsewhere herein, this sale will be effected by (1) the Spin-Off, in which Meredith shareholders will receive
interests in NMG SpinCo,
15Table of Contents
which will hold NMG and the corporate functions of Meredith, followed immediately by (2) the Merger of Meredith, holding the assets of LMG, with
a subsidiary of Gray (the “Transactions”).
The Transactions will be accounted for as a reverse spin-off, for reasons including that the legacy shareholders will continue to hold NMG SpinCo
Capital Stock and not Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock and that senior management will continue to manage NMG SpinCo and
not Meredith. The resulting accounting treatment is as though LMG is spun off and acquired by Gray, to leave behind NMG SpinCo, comprising
NMG and the corporate functions, which is the reverse of the legal form of the Transactions.
The pro forma condensed financial statements include the following pro forma adjustments to the historical financial information of Meredith:
•
Transaction Accounting Adjustments – Adjustments that reflect the application of required accounting for the Transactions and other
related transactions as follows:
•
in the pro forma condensed balance sheet, as though they occurred as of June 30, 2021; and
•
in the pro forma condensed statements of earnings (loss), the effects of the above pro forma balance sheet adjustments assuming
those adjustments were made as of July 1, 2020.
•
Autonomous Entity Adjustments – Adjustments that are necessary to reflect the operations and financial position of NMG SpinCo as
an autonomous entity.
The pro forma condensed statements of earnings (loss) for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 present LMG on a discontinued operations basis
because that presentation is not yet required in the historical financial statements for those periods.
The pro forma adjustments are based on factually supportable and available information and certain assumptions that management believes are
reasonable. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments have been made in preparing the pro forma condensed financial statements.
However, such adjustments are estimates and actual experience may differ from expectations. The pro forma condensed financial statements
presented do not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial position of NMG SpinCo would actually have been had the
Transactions and related transactions occurred on the dates noted above, or to project the results of operations or financial position of NMG
SpinCo for any future periods. The pro forma condensed balance sheet does not give effect to, for example, cash generated by or used in operations,
or collection of long-term receivables, after June 30, 2021.
The pro forma condensed financial statements have been derived from the historical audited consolidated financial statements of Meredith included
in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.
The pro forma condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and the historical financial statements and related notes thereto of Meredith Corporation included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(a)
Amounts as originally reported by Meredith in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.
(b)
Represents the elimination of the net assets and results of LMG, net of People TV and MNI, both of which were historically reported under
that segment but will be retained by NMG SpinCo in connection with the Transactions, together with certain other associated net assets that
will be transferred in the Transactions.
(c)
Other transaction related pro forma adjustments are as follows:
(1)
NMG SpinCo is required to make a cash payment of an amount that will result in the net debt (calculated as outstanding principal plus
debt breakage fees minus LMG cash on hand to be transferred in the Transactions to Gray) being equal to $1,975.0 million, as adjusted
for Meredith equity awards retired or issued prior to closing and as may be further adjusted downward for unpaid expenses incurred by
Meredith. The cash payment depicted in the pro forma condensed financial statements is calculated as set forth below:

This adjustment results from a June 30, 2021 payment by Meredith of $67.0 million to redeem warrants to purchase up to 1,625,000
shares of Meredith Common Stock.
2
The amount of the actual net cash payment required is dependent on factors including actual total long term debt at the date of the
closing of the Transactions. Further, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result,
the net cash payment required will be increased) by $30.0 million; provided that if Meredith provides the financial statements
comprising the RemainCo Required Financial Information in the Consent Agreement, then the target net debt amount will be reduced
(and as a result, the net cash payment required will be increased) by only $25.0 million. In addition, pursuant to the Consent
Agreement, if the closing of the Transactions occurs but does not occur on or before December 1, 2021, then, for each day thereafter
until the closing, the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result, the net cash payment required will be increased) by
$725,000, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Consent Agreement.

4
Debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility will be capitalized as an asset and accordingly are excluded from the
calculation of long-term debt.
The extent to which the revolving credit facility is funded at closing will be dependent on the amount of the required cash payment described
in note (1) above and available cash on hand as of that date, which will be impacted by factors including cash flows generated from or used in
operations and collections of long-term receivables prior to closing. On a pro forma basis, giving consideration to historical cash on hand as of
June 30, 2021, no funding of the revolving credit facility is required.
Pro forma adjustments to interest expense are calculated as follows:

Acceleration of amortization of other debt issuance costs relating to terminated revolving credit facility ($0 outstanding)

$
(21.7)
As a consequence of the interest rate floor of the $725 million term loan and the absence of outstanding principal on the $200 million revolving
credit facility, a 1/8% increase or decrease in LIBOR would have no impact on interest expense.

As a result of the legal form of the Transactions, it is anticipated that the gain on disposal will not result in incremental corporate income tax
expense. Accordingly, the pro forma gain on sale has not been reduced by an income tax charge.

Represents the establishment of a $68.0 million income tax payable related to unearned magazine subscription revenue for which
income taxes will become payable as a result of the change in control that occurs upon the consummation of the Transactions. A
corresponding deferred tax asset (recognized as a reduction of the net deferred tax liability) also is recognized due to the fact that
related subscription revenue, and resulting income tax expense, are not recognized in the statements of earnings until magazine issues
are subsequently delivered to subscribers.

to reduce the corporate burden on the business), would be expected to be incurred by NMG SpinCo as a standalone entity. The expenses
include selling, general, and administrative corporate costs of Meredith that were historically allocated to LMG. Adjustments specifically
include amounts related to IT and administrative services, as well as other corporate costs.
(e)
Represents the elimination from continuing operations of the results of LMG, net of People TV and MNI, both of which were historically
reported under that segment, but will be transferred to NMG immediately prior to the Transactions. As LMG is being disposed of in a spin-off
transaction rather than by sale, those operations are not yet required to be presented as discontinued operations in the historical financial
statements and accordingly are reclassified herein on a pro forma basis.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER",23,34
MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER
The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting.
These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the
documents we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. You
may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the caption “Where You
Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
The Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies
to be voted at the Special Meeting. The Special Meeting will be held (a) to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
and thereby approve the Merger, (b) to consider and vote, on an advisory basis, on the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers
may receive in connection with the Merger and (c) to vote to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if
there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger. No vote of
Meredith shareholders is required or being sought in connection with the Spin-Off or the Dotdash Merger.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will take place on November 30, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time. The Special Meeting will be held in virtual format
only. You will be able to attend the Special Meeting online, during which you can vote your shares, by visiting www.proxydocs.com/MDP.
Registration online at www.proxydocs.com/MDP is required for attendance. Shareholders will not be able to attend the meeting in person.
Q:
What are the key steps of the Spin-Off and Merger transactions?
A:
Below is a summary of the key steps of the Spin-Off and Merger transactions. See “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement The Merger”
beginning on page 50.
Step 1. Separation.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at a time on or prior to the date of the Distribution, Meredith will consummate
the Separation by causing (1) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the NMG business segment, the
MNI and People TV businesses and the corporate functions of Meredith to be transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be assumed
by, NMG SpinCo and (2) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the LMG business segment to be
retained by or transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be retained by or assumed by, Meredith. Following the Separation, NMG
SpinCo and its subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while Meredith (excluding NMG SpinCo and its
subsidiaries) will own all of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).
Step 2. SpinCo Cash Payment and Repayment of Meredith Debt.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, prior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make the
SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith (exclusive of any NMG SpinCo debt and after giving effect to the SpinCo
Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by Meredith and Gray to be
26Table of Contents
allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The proceeds of the SpinCo Cash Payment will be used by Gray, together
with cash on hand of Meredith and borrowings by Gray, to satisfy all of Meredith’s outstanding long-term debt as of the date of the Closing. The
SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand (which will be taken into account in
determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing
or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in
connection with the Dotdash Merger.
Step 3. Distribution and Spin-Off.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will
consummate the Spin-Off of NMG SpinCo by making the Distribution of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock to Meredith
shareholders holding Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock, respectively, on a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will
maintain Meredith’s existing dual-class voting structure. Prior to completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and a
Distribution Date. Meredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is completed, but the Distribution
Record Date will be an earlier date.
After the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per
share with respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote, the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten
votes per share on such matters, NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by the pre-merger shareholders of
Meredith, and NMG SpinCo is expected to retain the “Meredith” name and “MDP” ticker symbol.
Step 4. Merger.
Immediately following completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meredith, with Meredith surviving the merger and
becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Gray (referred to herein as LMG RemainCo). As a result of the Merger, Gray will acquire our LMG business
segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses). In the Merger, each share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing will be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all
applicable tax withholding.
Dotdash Merger
On October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo have entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement to sell NMG
SpinCo to Dotdash. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, and for so long as the
Merger Agreement is in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the Closing of the Merger. We
currently expect the Dotdash Merger to be consummated on the same day as and following the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger, if
the closing conditions for the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Spin-
Off and the Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger pursuant to
the Dotdash Merger Agreement, unless the Dotdash Merger is terminated earlier. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a
publicly-traded company operating the LMG business, and, until the Dotdash Merger is completed, NMG, and in the event the Merger Agreement
is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off
Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash
Merger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo
and by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote
required for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the
Dotdash Merger.

If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment
as provided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock. The cash payment received by NMG SpinCo shareholders
will be in addition to the cash Merger Consideration that Meredith shareholders will receive if the Merger is completed.
For more information regarding the Dotdash Merger, the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the consideration that shareholders will receive in respect
of the shares of NMG SpinCo that will have previously been received by Meredith shareholders in the Spin-Off, see the Company’s Form 8-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2021.
Q:
What will happen to Meredith as a result of the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed (which will occur immediately after the completion of the Spin-Off but prior to the Dotdash Merger), Meredith will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gray, and Gray will thereby acquire our LMG business segment, as described herein.
Q:
What will happen to my shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock after the Merger?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, each outstanding share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock will automatically be canceled and
will be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding. This does not apply to
shares of Meredith Class B Stock held by any Meredith shareholders who have properly demanded (and not withdrawn or lost) their appraisal
rights under Iowa law (as more fully described below under the heading “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 92 of this proxy
statement).
Additionally, prior to and as a condition to the Merger, Meredith will consummate the Spin-Off, whereby you will receive one share of NMG SpinCo
Common Stock for each share of Meredith Common Stock you hold and one share of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class
B Stock you hold, as further described herein. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive
$42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as provided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock.
Q:
Why is the Spin-Off important and a condition to the Closing?
A:
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meredith, with Meredith surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Gray, following which Gray will own Meredith’s LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses). In order to
effect this transaction, the assets and liabilities relating to Meredith’s NMG business segments must first be separated from the remainder of
Meredith so that, at the Closing, Meredith only owns the assets and liabilities relating to the LMG business segment that Gray has agreed to
acquire. Accordingly, the separation of Meredith into two independent companies by way of the Spin-Off is an important step in the transactions
agreed to by the parties, and the consummation of the Spin-Off is a condition to the Closing of the Merger.
Q:
What is the impact of Meredith’s entry into the Dotdash Merger Agreement?
A:
On October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement to sell NMG SpinCo to
Dotdash, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger,
and for so long as the Merger Agreement is in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the
Closing of the Merger. We currently expect the Dotdash Merger to be consummated on the same day as and following the consummation of the
Spin-Off and the Merger, if the closing conditions for the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each
holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as provided in the Dotdash Merger
Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock.

Pursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash
Merger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo
and by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote
required for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the
Dotdash Merger.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is November 15, 2021, which is earlier than the date of the Special
Meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares and each of you notifies us in writing of such special
arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the special meeting but will otherwise transfer ownership of your shares of Meredith
Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock before the completion of the
Merger?
A:
Only holders of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock at the effective time of the Merger will become entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration. If you sell your shares prior to the completion of the Merger, you will not become entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration by virtue of the Merger. Additionally, prior to the completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and the
Distribution Date in connection with the Spin-Off. Meredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is
completed, but the Distribution Record Date will be an earlier date. Only holders of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock as
of such Distribution Record Date will become entitled to receive shares of NMG SpinCo in the Spin-Off. If the Dotdash Merger is completed,
holders of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock at the time of the closing of the Dotdash Merger will receive $42.18 in cash
(subject to downward adjustment as set forth in the Dotdash Merger Agreement).
Q:
Will I own any shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock after the Merger?
A:
No. You will be paid cash for any shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock you own in Meredith. Additionally, prior to and as a
condition to the Merger, you will receive one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Meredith Common Stock you hold and one
share of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock for each share of Meredith Class B Stock you hold as of the Distribution Record Date pursuant to the
Distribution, as further described herein. If the Dotdash Merger is completed, holders of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B
Stock at the time of the closing of the Dotdash Merger will receive $42.18 in cash (subject to downward adjustment as set forth in the Dotdash
Merger Agreement).
Q:
Will I own any shares of Gray Common Stock after the Merger?
A:
Only if you own shares of common stock, no par value per share, Pursuant to the IBCA, of Gray or Class A common stock, no par value per share,
of Gray (collectively, “Gray Common Stock”) before the Merger and you continue to hold those shares after the Merger. The shares of Gray
Common Stock that you own, if any, prior to the Merger will be unaffected as a result of the Merger. Our shareholders will not be issued any shares
of Gray Common Stock as a result of the Merger.
Q:
What happens to my vested and unvested Meredith stock options, RSUs and Share-Based Awards in the Merger?
A:
Upon the completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option, RSU and Share-Based Award granted under Meredith’s equity plans (including
such options, RSUs and Share Based Awards that vest in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive from
Gray an amount
29
Table of Contents
of cash equal to $16.99 per share (or in the case of stock options, the excess, if any, of $16.99 over the exercise price of such option, as adjusted in
connection with the Spin-Off), without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding.
Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, each outstanding stock option granted under Meredith’s equity plans will be
converted into two options: (1) an adjusted Company stock option that will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in
the Merger as described above, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares. The number of shares subject to the adjusted Company stock
option and the NMG SpinCo stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Company stock option prior to the Spin-Off,
but the exercise prices will be adjusted to reflect the relative values of LMG and NMG. The NMG SpinCo stock options will generally be subject to
the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related Company stock option award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo
stock options held by employees of LMG will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the
excess, if any, of the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date
(or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the
Dotdash Merger Agreement) less the adjusted exercise price for such option.
Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of outstanding RSUs and Share-Based Awards granted under
Meredith’s equity plans will receive RSUs and Share-Based Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares subject to the
related Company award prior to the Spin-Off. The NMG SpinCo RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and
conditions as set forth in the related Company award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the “when-issued” trading price of NMG
SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the
cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement).

beginning on page 130 for more information.
Q:
Will the Merger be taxable to me?
A:
Generally, yes. In general, the receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock pursuant
to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, subject to the more complete summary referenced in the
next sentence, if you are a “U.S. person” (as defined in such summary) this means that for U.S. federal income tax purposes you will recognize
taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the total amount of cash you receive in the Merger for your shares of Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. You should read “The Merger—Certain Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger” beginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of certain
material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
Q:
Will the Distribution be taxable to me?
A:
The receipt by you of shares of NMG SpinCo Stock in the Distribution will generally be a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market
value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received to the extent of your ratable share of Meredith’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with the
excess treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock,
as applicable, and then as capital gain. For a more detailed discussion, you should read “The Merger—Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger” beginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of certain material
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution.

Q:
Will the Dotdash Merger be taxable to me?
A:
Generally, yes. The receipt of cash by you in exchange for your shares of NMG SpinCo Stock pursuant to the Dotdash Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the Distribution, we expect you
to have a tax basis in your NMG SpinCo Stock received in the Distribution that is equal to the cash received by you in the Dotdash Merger, in
which case you will not recognize gain or loss in connection with the Dotdash Merger. You should read “The Merger—Certain Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution, the Merger, and the Dotdash Merger” beginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of
certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Dotdash Merger.
Q:
Does our Board recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement?
A:
Yes. Our Board unanimously recommends that our shareholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the
Merger. Our Board considered many factors in deciding to unanimously recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby approve
the Merger. These factors are described in “The Merger—Reasons for the Transaction and Reasons for Recommendation of Our Board” beginning
on page 51.
Q:
What vote of the shareholders is required to adopt the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
A:
The Merger Proposal requires for its approval the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of all votes cast by the holders of shares of
Meredith Common Stock present, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, voting as a separate class, (ii) a majority of all
votes cast by the holders of shares of Meredith Class B Stock present virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, voting as a
separate class, and (iii) a majority of all votes cast by the holders of shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock present,
virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, voting together as a single class. Shares not present at the Special Meeting,
abstentions and broker non-votes (which will not be considered as votes cast) will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Merger
Proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
The Compensation Proposal requires for its approval the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all votes cast by the holders of Meredith
Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock present, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, voting together as a single

The Adjournment Proposal requires for its approval the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all votes cast by the holders of Meredith
Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock present, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, voting together as a single

on the outcome of the vote on the Adjournment Proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
All Meredith shareholders as of the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Meredith Common
Stock or Meredith Class B Stock held in street name, you must provide evidence of your ownership of such shares, which you can obtain from
your broker, banker or nominee, in order to attend the Special Meeting.
Pursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Spin-Off or the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on
the Spin-Off or the Dotdash Merger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board,
by the board of NMG SpinCo and by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is
the only shareholder vote required for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the
consummation of the Dotdash Merger.

Q:
Are any Meredith shareholders already committed to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal?
A:
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, Gray entered into the Support Agreement with certain Company shareholders, including
Dianna Mell Meredith Frazier and Edwin T. Meredith, IV, who collectively control 1.7% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Common Stock and
approximately 89.3% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Class B Stock (representing approximately 50.3% of the voting power when voting
together as a single class) as of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, such shareholders agreed to vote their Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement. Please see “Proposal 1—Voting and Support Agreement” for additional detail regarding the Support Agreement.
Q:
What constitutes a quorum for the Special Meeting?
A:
With respect to each proposal, and with respect to each voting group with respect to the Merger Proposal, Holders of a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock eligible to vote on each such proposal at the Special
Meeting represented virtually or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for each such proposal at the Special Meeting. The shares of Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock held by a shareholder present virtually at the Special Meeting, but not voting, and shares of Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock for which Meredith has received proxies indicating that holders thereof have abstained will be counted as
present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is established.
Q:
Who can attend the Special Meeting?
A:
If you were a holder of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock as of the Record Date, you are entitled to virtually attend and vote at
the Special Meeting. In order to attend the Special Meeting, you must register at www.proxydocs.com/MDP.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
A:
Only holders of Meredith Class B Stock are entitled to appraisal rights. Under Iowa law, you have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of your
shares of Meredith Class B Stock as determined in accordance with Iowa statute if the Merger is completed, but only if you submit a written notice
of your intent to demand payment before the vote on the Merger Agreement, do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and comply
with the Iowa law procedures explained in this proxy statement. Please see the discussion below beginning on page 92 for a detailed discussion.
Annex C to this proxy statement contains a copy of the IBCA statute relating to shareholders’ right of appraisal. Failure to follow all of the steps
required by this statute may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, shareholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Meredith Class B Stock are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel and financial advisors with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Shareholders considering seeking appraisal should be
aware that the fair value of their Meredith Class B Stock as determined pursuant to the IBCA could be greater than, the same as or less than the
value of the Merger Consideration.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes, and consider how the Merger affects you. Then, mail your completed,
dated and signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope or appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instruction on
the enclosed proxy card as soon as possible so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What does it mean if I received more than one set of proxy materials?
A:
If you received more than one set of proxy materials, it means that you hold shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock in more
than one account. For example, you may own your shares in
32
Table of Contents
various forms, including jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor. To ensure that all of your shares are voted,
please provide a proxy or voting instructions for each account for which you received proxy materials.
Q:
What happens if I do not return a proxy card or otherwise appoint a proxy?
A:
The failure to return your proxy card by the deadline of 11:59 p.m., Central Standard Time, on November 29, 2021, or to vote virtually prior to the
polls closing during the Special Meeting, will result in your vote not being counted as votes cast on the proposals and therefore have no effect on
the results of the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement (assuming a quorum is present).

Q:
What happens if I transfer my shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock after the Record Date?
A:
The Record Date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the effective time of the Merger.
Therefore, transferors of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock after the Record Date but prior to the consummation of the
Merger will retain their right to vote at the Special Meeting, but the right to receive the Merger Consideration and NMG SpinCo Common Stock or
NMG SpinCo Class B Stock, as applicable (together with the right to receive any consideration in respect thereto if the Dotdash Merger is
consummated) will transfer with the shares.
Q:
May I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise appointed a proxy?
A:
Yes. You may change your vote at any time before the shares reflected on your proxy card (or with respect to which you have appointed a proxy
over the Internet or by telephone) are voted at the Special Meeting. You can do this in one of four ways. First, you can send a written, dated notice
to our corporate secretary stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete, sign, date and submit a new proxy card
bearing a later date. Third, you can submit a subsequent proxy over the Internet or by telephone. Fourth, you can virtually attend the meeting and
vote virtually. Your virtual attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow the
directions received from your broker to change your voting instructions.
Q:
If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
Your broker will not vote your shares with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement without instructions from you. You should instruct
your broker to vote your shares, following the procedure provided by your broker. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted with respect
to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the approval of, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith’s named
34
Table of Contents
executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger or, to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies
if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock certificates
or book-entry shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
The Merger is currently expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger
cannot occur earlier than (i) December 1, 2021 or (ii) the completion of the marketing period under the Gray Commitment Letter (unless such
marketing period is scheduled to be completed after December 30, 2021, in which event the Closing will occur on December 30, 2021, in each case
unless otherwise agreed by Meredith, Gray and Merger Sub). However, neither Meredith nor Gray can predict the actual date on which the Merger
will be completed, nor can Meredith or Gray be certain that the Merger will be completed, because completion is subject to conditions beyond the
control of Meredith and Gray.
If the conditions to completing the Dotdash Merger have been satisfied or waived, Meredith currently expects the Dotdash Merger to be
consummated on the same day as, and following completion of, the Spin-Off and Merger. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day
as the Spin-Off and Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger
pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement unless the Dotdash Merger Agreement is terminated earlier.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Meredith’s shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Meredith’s
shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock and NMG SpinCo will not be spun
off into an independently traded public company. Instead, Meredith will remain an independent public company, the Meredith Common Stock will
continue to be listed and traded on NYSE and Meredith will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of the Meredith Common
Stock.
Under specified circumstances, Meredith and/or Gray may be required to reimburse each party’s expenses or pay a termination fee upon termination
of the Merger Agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Termination of the
Merger Agreement.”
If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the Local Media Group business, and in the event
the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and
the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.
Q:
When will I receive the cash consideration for my shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock?
A:
After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock certificates or
book-entry shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. When you properly return and complete the required documentation described in the
written instructions or letter of transmittal, you will receive from the exchange agent a payment of the cash consideration for your shares.
35
Table of Contents
Q:
When will I receive the cash consideration for my shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock resulting from the
Dotdash Merger?
A:
After the Dotdash Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock
certificates or book-entry shares of NMG SpinCo pursuant to such letter of transmittal. When you properly return and complete the required
documentation described in the written instructions or letter of transmittal, you will receive from the exchange agent a payment of cash
consideration for your shares.
Q:
Is the Spin-Off dependent on Meredith’s shareholders approving the Merger?
A:
No. Meredith shareholder approval is not a condition of the Spin-Off. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason,
Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the LMG business and NMG business, and Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to
negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the agreement relating to the Spin-Off, subject to the terms of the Dotdash
Merger Agreement. In such a scenario, it is possible that Meredith could either abandon the Spin-Off or nevertheless spin off NMG to its
shareholders in connection with the disposition of that business in the Dotdash Merger.
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection
with the Merger?
A:
In accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, we are required to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the
compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger, which is reflected in the Compensation
Proposal herein.
Q:
What will happen if our shareholders do not approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive
in connection with the Merger?
A:
Approval of the “golden parachute” compensation arrangements payable under existing agreements that the named executive officers of Meredith
may receive in connection with the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the “golden parachute”
compensation arrangements is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Gray or us. Therefore, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by our
shareholders and completed, the “golden parachute” compensation arrangements will still be paid to our named executive officers as long as any
other conditions applicable thereto are satisfied, regardless of the results of the vote.

In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the matters addressed in the section titled
“Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding whether to vote to approve
the Merger Agreement. You should also consider the other information in this document and the other documents incorporated by reference into this
document. See the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the transaction could negatively
impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Meredith.
The completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (1) approval by Meredith shareholders, (2) the expiration or termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, (3) the receipt of FCC consent, (4) the absence of certain legal impediments, (5) the payment of the SpinCo
Cash Payment by NMG SpinCo to Meredith, (6) completion of the Spin-Off, and (7) other customary closing conditions, as well as conditions unique to
Gray and Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”
beginning on page 120.
Completion of the Spin-Off (and therefore the Merger) is subject to certain conditions, including (1) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
consummation of the Merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are satisfied at the closing), (2) consummation of the SpinCo Debt
Financing (except that, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, this condition can be satisfied without full funding of the SpinCo Debt Financing to the
extent the Dotdash Merger closes on the same day as the Spin-Off and the Merger and the SpinCo Cash Payment is fully paid through funds advanced
by Dotdash, subject to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement) and payment of the SpinCo Cash Payment, (3) effectiveness of a
Registration Statement on Form 10 regarding NMG SpinCo Common Stock, (4) receipt by the Company and NMG SpinCo of a solvency opinion, (5) the
acceptance of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for listing on the NYSE, (6) the absence of certain legal impediments, and (7) other customary closing
conditions.
We cannot assure you that the Merger and Spin-Off will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. We have expended
and will continue to expend a significant amount of time and resources on the transaction, and a failure to consummate the transaction as currently
contemplated, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on Meredith’s business and results of operations.
If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of Meredith may be adversely affected and Meredith will be subject to several risks, including the
following:
•
the Spin-Off will not be completed;
•
being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gray a termination fee of $73 million;
•
being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gray a termination fee of $113 million;
•
being required, under certain circumstances, to reimburse certain of Gray’s expenses up to $10 million;
•
having to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing,
printing and mailing fees and integration costs that have already been incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing;
•
the focus of management of Meredith on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Meredith;
•
the market price of Meredith could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be
completed; and
37Table of Contents
•
if the Merger Agreement is terminated and Meredith’s board of directors seeks another business combination for LMG, shareholders of
Meredith cannot be certain that Meredith will be able to find a party willing to enter into a business combination or other strategic
transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Gray has agreed to in the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off
Agreements;
in each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the Merger and Spin-Off completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed,
Meredith may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. Meredith could also be subject to litigation
related to any failure to complete the Merger and Spin-Off or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Meredith to perform its obligations under
the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off Agreements. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the
Local Media Group business, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments
to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement, which would require additional
resources and management attention to complete. If the Merger and Spin-Off are not completed, Meredith cannot assure its shareholders that these risks
will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock price of Meredith.
See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 120.
Meredith and Gray may not be able to obtain the required approvals from the FCC.
Meredith’s and Gray’s obligation to complete the transaction is subject to obtaining FCC consent to the transfer of control of Meredith and the broadcast
licensee subsidiaries of Meredith in connection with the transaction and termination or expiration of any waiting period (and extension thereof) under the
HSR Act. Under the Merger Agreement, Meredith and Gray are each obligated to use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable the
necessary consent from the FCC and termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act regarding the transaction subject to certain
limitations. To facilitate the receipt of such approvals, Gray divested its television broadcast station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA,
WJRT-TV (the “Divestiture”). On October 8, 2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated. Although Meredith and Gray believe that they
will be able to obtain the required consent of the FCC they cannot be sure they will do so. Failure to obtain the required FCC consent would prevent
Meredith and Gray from completing the transaction.
On June 14, 2021, Meredith and Gray each received a Second Request from the Antitrust Division, which defines the “Relevant Area” as the Flint-
Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA and the “Relevant Product” as “the sale of spot advertising time on broadcast television stations.” The issuance of a
Second Request extends the waiting period until thirty calendar days after Meredith and Gray comply with the Second Request or until the Antitrust
Division terminates the waiting period. On July 14, 2021, Gray announced an agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City,
Michigan DMA to Allen Media. On September 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of
WJRT-TV. On September 23, 2021, Gray consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in
the same DMA. The Antitrust Division informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8,
2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated.
The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the Spin-Off, which requires certain financing conditions to be met, which may not be met in a
timely manner or at all.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, NMG SpinCo must make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net
debt of Meredith (exclusive of the NMG SpinCo debt and after
38
Table of Contents
giving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments, the amount of net debt agreed by Meredith
and Gray to be allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the
following sources: available cash on hand (which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through
borrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo Debt Financing or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of
the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger. If NMG SpinCo needs to consummate the
SpinCo Debt Financing to pay the SpinCo Cash Payment and cannot consummate the SpinCo Debt Financing, the Merger cannot close. In the event Gray
or Meredith is entitled to terminate, and elects to terminate, the Merger Agreement at the “End Date” (as defined in the Merger Agreement) prior to
completion of the Merger and, at such time, all of the conditions to Meredith’s obligation to consummate the Distribution, Spin-Off and Merger have
been satisfied (other than the conditions that the SpinCo Debt Financing has been consummated and funded and that the SpinCo Cash Payment has
been made), Meredith will be obligated to pay a termination fee to Gray in the amount of $73 million.
If the proposed Merger is not completed, our business could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline.
The Merger is subject to closing conditions and may not be completed or may not be completed as quickly as expected. If the Merger Agreement is
terminated, the market price of Meredith Common Stock will likely decline, as we believe that our market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will
be completed. For example, on April 30, 2021, the last full trading day prior to public announcement of the proposed Merger, shares of Meredith Common
Stock closed at $31.10 per share. On May 3, 2021, the first full trading day after the public announcement of the proposed Merger, shares of Meredith
Common Stock closed at $35.21 per share. On November 5, 2021, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, shares of
Meredith Common Stock closed at $58.20 per share. In addition, our stock price may be adversely affected as a result of the fact that we have incurred
and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger and Dotdash Merger, a portion of which will not be recovered if the Merger is not
completed. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the Local Media Group business, and in the
event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and
the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement, which would create additional transaction related expenses. If the
Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Gray a termination fee of up to $113 million. As a consequence
of the failure of the Merger to be completed, as well as of some or all of these potential effects of the termination of the Merger Agreement, our business
could be materially and adversely affected.
The existence of the pending Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.
While the Merger is pending, advertisers and other sources of revenue may decide to delay, defer or cancel purchases of our products and/or services,
pending completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. If these decisions represent a significant portion of our anticipated revenue,
our results of operations and quarterly revenues could be substantially below the expectations of market analysts.
In addition, while the Merger is pending, we are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations,
including:
•
the diversion of management and employee attention and the unavoidable disruption to our relationships with customers and vendors may
detract from our ability to grow revenues and minimize costs;
•
the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger;
39
Table of Contents
•
the fact that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we must generally conduct our business in the ordinary course and we are subject to a
variety of other restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the Closing or termination of the Merger Agreement;
•
preparation for the Dotdash Merger, which requires resources and management attention; and
•
the fact that we may be unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.
The Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict Meredith’s ability to pursue alternatives to the transaction and, in specified circumstances,
could require Meredith to pay to Gray a termination fee.
Under the Merger Agreement, Meredith is restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating or negotiating, or
furnishing non-public information with regard to, any inquiry, proposal or offer for an alternative business combination transaction from any person.
Meredith may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Company Proposal (as defined herein) only if
specified conditions have been satisfied, including a determination by the Board (after consultation with third party financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that such proposal could be more favorable to the Meredith shareholders than the Merger from a financial point of view. A termination in this
instance would result in Meredith being required to pay Gray a fee of $113 million. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of
Meredith to procure the requisite shareholder vote, Meredith will be required to pay Gray reimbursement of expenses up to $10 million. These provisions
could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Meredith from considering or proposing an alternative
business combination transaction with Meredith, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the value of the
transaction. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 124.
Meredith’s executive officers and directors have interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meredith
shareholders generally.
In considering the unanimous recommendation of our Board to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that the
consummation of the Merger will result in certain benefits to our directors and executive officers that are not available to our shareholders generally.
Meredith’s Board was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the Merger and in deciding to recommend that Meredith
shareholders vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. These interests include:
•
continued employment with NMG SpinCo or with Gray, as applicable;
•
cash out of certain equity awards;
•
receipt of new NMG SpinCo equity awards; and
•
eligibility to receive severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations.
Please see “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 85 for a more detailed description of the
interests of Meredith’s directors and executive officers.
If the Merger occurs, our shareholders will not be able to participate in any upside to our LMG business.
Upon consummation of the Merger, our shareholders will receive $16.99 in cash per share, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, for
each shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock owned by them, but will not receive any shares of Gray common stock. As a result, if
our LMG segment performs well following the Merger, our current shareholders will not receive any additional consideration, and will therefore not
receive any benefit from the performance of the business.
40
Table of Contents
If the Merger occurs, the Distribution will generally be taxable to our shareholders.
If the Merger occurs, the receipt by our shareholders of shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock in the Distribution will
generally be a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received to the extent of the shareholder’s ratable
share of Meredith’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with the excess treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the
shareholder’s tax basis in shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, and then as capital gain. For a more detailed
discussion, see “The Merger—Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger”
beginning on page 95 for a more complete summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution, the Merger and the
Dotdash Merger.
Most shareholders holding Meredith Common Stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders, in connection with certain mergers, to demand that the corporation
pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in
connection with the merger. Under the IBCA and the organization documents of the Company, only shareholders holding Meredith Class B Stock are
entitled to such appraisal rights.
In the event the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Merger, NMG SpinCo may be unable to achieve some or all of the expected
benefits from its separation from Meredith.
In the event the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Merger, NMG SpinCo will continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company
until consummation of the Dotdash Merger Agreement unless the Dotdash Merger Agreement is terminated earlier. As a new, publicly traded company,
the Company still believes that NMG SpinCo’s business will benefit from, among other things, allowing its management to design and implement
strategies that are based primarily on the characteristics of its operating business, allowing NMG SpinCo to focus its time and financial resources wholly
on its own operations and implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet its own specific needs. NMG SpinCo may not be able to achieve
some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve as a new operating company or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all for a variety of
reasons, including the following:
•
the separation will require significant amounts of the NMG SpinCo management’s time and effort, which may divert management’s attention from
operating and growing the business;
•
following the Separation, NMG SpinCo may be more susceptible to economic downturns and other adverse events than if it was still a part of
Meredith;
•
following the Separation, the NMG SpinCo business will be less diversified than Meredith’s business prior to the separation;
•
following the Separation, the NMG SpinCo business will experience a loss of scale and access to certain financial, managerial, and professional
resources as well as product and brand power influence and recognition with some customers from which Meredith has benefited in the past; and
•
actions required to separate the respective businesses could disrupt its operations.
If the Dotdash Merger does not occur and if NMG SpinCo were unable to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if
such benefits are delayed, the NMG SpinCo business could be harmed and the value of NMG SpinCo shares that Meredith’s shareholders receive as a
result of the transactions described herein could be harmed.

approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger, and “FOR”
approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.
To vote, please complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or, to vote by appointing a proxy over the Internet or by telephone, follow the
instructions provided below. If you virtually attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote virtually, you may withdraw your proxy and vote virtually. If
your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record to be
able to vote at the Special Meeting.
Shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock represented at the Special Meeting but not voted, including shares of Meredith Common
Stock and Meredith Class B Stock for which proxies have been received but for which shareholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the
Special Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.
Only shares affirmatively voted for the adoption of the Merger Agreement, including properly executed proxies that do not contain specific voting
instructions, will be counted in favor of that proposal. If you properly execute a proxy card, appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone or attend
the Special Meeting virtually, but abstain from voting on any of the proposals at the Special Meeting, it will not be counted as votes cast on such
proposals and therefore have no effect on the results of the vote on the proposals from which you abstained (assuming a quorum is present). If you do
not properly execute a proxy card, do not appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone and do not attend the Special Meeting virtually, it will not be
counted as votes cast on the proposals and therefore will have no effect on the results of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the
proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger, or the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special
Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (in each case, assuming a quorum is present). Brokers who hold shares in street name for customers have the
authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are precluded from
exercising their voting discretion with respect to approval of non-routine matters, such as the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the proposal to
approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger and the proposal
to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
adopt the Merger Agreement, and, as a result,

absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, brokers are not empowered to vote those shares, referred to generally as “broker
non-votes.” Broker non-votes, if any, will be treated as shares that are present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists but will not be counted as votes cast on the proposals and therefore will have no effect on the results of the vote on the proposal to adopt of the
Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection
with the Merger, or the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the
time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (in each case, assuming a quorum is present).
We do not expect that any matter other than the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the
compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if
necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement will be
brought before the Special Meeting.
Pursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Spin-Off or the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the
Spin-Off or the Dotdash Merger. The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the
board of NMG SpinCo and by the Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only
shareholder vote required for the Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation
of the Dotdash Merger.

You may also grant a proxy to vote your shares over the Internet or by telephone. The IBCA specifically permits electronically transmitted proxies,
provided that each such proxy contains or is submitted with information from which the inspector of election can determine that such proxy was
authorized by the shareholder.
The Internet and telephone voting procedures described below are designed to authenticate shareholders’ identities, to allow shareholders to grant a
proxy to vote their shares and to confirm that shareholders’ instructions have been recorded properly. Shareholders granting a proxy to vote over the
Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and
telephone companies, that must be borne by the shareholder.
For Shares Registered in Your Name
Shareholders of record may go to www.proxydocs.com/MDP to grant a proxy to vote their shares over the Internet. Have your proxy card in hand when
you access the web site and follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form. Any shareholder using a
touch-tone telephone may also grant a proxy to vote shares by calling the number printed on your proxy card and following the recorded instructions.
For Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then such broker or other nominee is considered to be the
shareholder of record with respect to your shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, with your shares being
held in “street name.” Most beneficial owners whose stock is held in street name receive instructions for authorizing votes by the broker or other
nominee.
If your shares are held in street name, you may be eligible to vote your shares by telephone or through the Internet. A large number of banks and
brokerage firms provide eligible shareholders the opportunity to vote in this manner. If your bank or brokerage firm allows for this, your voting form
provided by your broker or other nominee will provide instructions for such alternative method of voting.

The grant of a proxy on the enclosed proxy card or over the Internet or by telephone does not preclude a shareholder from voting virtually at the Special
Meeting. You may revoke your proxy at any time before the shares reflected on your proxy card (or with respect to which you have appointed a proxy
over the Internet or by telephone) are voted virtually at the Special Meeting by:
•
filing with our corporate secretary a properly executed and dated revocation of proxy;
•
submitting a properly completed, executed and dated proxy card to our corporate secretary bearing a later date;
•
submitting a subsequent vote over the Internet or by telephone; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually.
Your virtual attendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. If you have instructed your broker to vote

shareholders by telephone or other electronic means. We also may reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in
sending these materials to you and getting your voting instructions. We have also retained the services of a paid solicitor, Innisfree, or Innisfree, to
solicit proxies. We anticipate that the cost of utilizing the services of Innisfree for the solicitation of proxies will be approximately $75,000, plus expenses,
and will be paid by Meredith.
You should not send any stock certificates that you hold with your proxy card. A letter of transmittal with instructions for use in effecting the surrender

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (for example, brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with
respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address, if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family, by delivering a single proxy
statement addressed to those shareholders. Each shareholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. This process,
which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies by reducing the
volume of duplicate information.
A number of brokers with account holders who are our shareholders will be “householding” our proxy materials. A single proxy statement will be
delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have
received notice from your broker or us that they will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are

MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Transaction Steps,"Transaction Steps
Step 1. Separation.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at a time on or prior to the date of the Distribution, Meredith will consummate the
Separation, and pursuant thereto, cause (1) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the NMG business
segment, the MNI and People TV businesses, and corporate functions of Meredith to be transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be
assumed by, NMG SpinCo and (2) certain subsidiaries, assets and employees of Meredith or its subsidiaries relating to the LMG business segment to be
retained by or transferred to, and certain liabilities relating thereto to be retained by or assumed by, Meredith. Following the Separation, NMG SpinCo and
its subsidiaries will own all of the NMG business segment and corporate functions, while Meredith (excluding NMG SpinCo and its subsidiaries) will own
all of the LMG business segment (excluding the MNI and People TV businesses).
Step 2. SpinCo Cash Payment and Repayment of Meredith Debt.
Prior to the Distribution, NMG SpinCo or one of its subsidiaries will make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith such that the net debt of Meredith
(exclusive of any NMG SpinCo debt and after giving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment) would be equal to $1.975 billion (subject to certain adjustments,
the amount of net debt agreed by Meredith and Gray to be allocated to Meredith in connection with the Separation and Spin-Off). The proceeds of the
SpinCo Cash Payment, together with cash on hand of Meredith and borrowings by Gray, will be used to satisfy all of Meredith’s outstanding long-term
debt as of the date of the Closing. The SpinCo Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand (which will
be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit facility from the SpinCo
Debt Financing (as defined below) or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds
advanced by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.
Step 3. Distribution and Spin-Off.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, following the Separation and immediately prior to the Merger, Meredith will
consummate the Spin-Off of NMG SpinCo by making the Distribution of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock to Meredith
shareholders holding Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock, respectively, on a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will maintain
Meredith’s existing dual-class voting structure. Prior to completion of the Merger, Meredith will set the Distribution Record Date and a Distribution Date.
Meredith expects such Distribution Date to be the same date as the date that the Merger is completed, but the Distribution Record Date will be an earlier
date.
After the Distribution, if the Dotdash Merger is not consummated on the same day: the NMG SpinCo Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share
with respect to matters on which the NMG SpinCo shareholders are entitled to vote; the NMG SpinCo Class B Stock will be entitled to ten votes per share
on such matters; NMG SpinCo will be a standalone, publicly traded company owned 100% by the pre-merger Meredith shareholders; and NMG SpinCo is
expected to the “Meredith” name and “MDP” ticker symbol.
50Table of Contents
Step 4. Merger.
Immediately following completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meredith, with Meredith surviving the merger and becoming a
wholly owned subsidiary of Gray (referred to herein as LMG RemainCo). As a result of the Merger, Gray will acquire our LMG business segment
(excluding the MNI and People TV businesses). In the merger, each share of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing will be converted into the right to receive $16.99 in cash, without interest and subject to all applicable tax
withholding. This cash will be in addition to the shares of NMG SpinCo that our shareholders will receive pursuant to the Distribution.
Dotdash Merger
On October 6, 2021, Meredith announced that the Company and NMG SpinCo have entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement to sell NMG SpinCo to
Dotdash. Completion of the Dotdash Merger is not a condition to consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, and for so long as the Merger Agreement is
in effect, the Dotdash Merger will not, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, occur until after the Closing of the Merger. We currently expect the Dotdash
Merger to be consummated on the same day as and following the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger, if the closing conditions for the Dotdash
Merger have been satisfied or waived. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the Spin-Off and the Merger, NMG SpinCo will
continue as a stand-alone, publicly traded company until consummation of the Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement, unless the
Dotdash Merger is terminated earlier. If the Merger is not completed, Meredith will continue as a publicly-traded company operating the LMG business,
and, until the Dotdash Merger is completed, NMG, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate
certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the IBCA, Meredith shareholders are not required to vote on the Dotdash Merger and are not being asked to vote on the Dotdash Merger.
The Dotdash Merger pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board, by the board of NMG SpinCo and by the
Company, as the sole shareholder of NMG SpinCo (the constituent corporation in the merger). As this is the only shareholder vote required for the
Dotdash Merger, no additional approvals of Meredith or NMG SpinCo shareholders are required for the consummation of the Dotdash Merger.
If the Dotdash Merger is completed, each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock will be entitled to receive $42.18 in cash, subject to downward adjustment as
provided in the Dotdash Merger Agreement, for each share of NMG SpinCo Stock. The cash payment received by NMG SpinCo shareholders will be in
addition to the cash Merger Consideration that Meredith shareholders will receive if the Merger is completed.
For more information regarding the Dotdash Merger, the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the consideration that shareholders will receive in respect of
the shares of NMG SpinCo that will have previously been received by Meredith shareholders in the Spin-Off, see the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2021.",58,59

Merger Agreement
At its meeting on May 3, 2021, the Company’s Board unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement (as executed on May 3, 2021) and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, (b) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, taken together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration
the effect on the Company’s shareholders as well as the effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, and (d) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
thereby the Merger.
51Table of Contents
See “Reasons for the Transaction and Reasons for the Recommendation of Our Board—Amendment to Merger Agreement” below for discussion of
the reasons for the recommendation of our Board that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, as amended by
the amendment to the Merger Agreement executed on June 2, 2021.
As described elsewhere in this proxy statement, on October 6, 2021, the Company and NMG SpinCo entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement. The
Board’s decision to approve the Merger, as described in more detail below, was made prior to the Dotdash Merger opportunity. Accordingly, the reasons
for the Board’s decision to recommend that shareholders approve the Merger, as set forth below, were developed before the Company’s entry into the
Dotdash Merger. However, the Dotdash Merger does not alter the recommendation of our Board that shareholders approve the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, as amended.
In its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transaction, our Board consulted with the Company’s senior management as well as legal, regulatory
and financial advisors to the Company, and considered a number of factors, which are discussed below. The following discussion of the information and
factors considered by our Board is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with the transaction
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our Board did not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights
to the specific material factors it considered in reaching its decision. In addition, individual members of our Board may have given different weight to
different factors. Our Board considered this information and these factors as a whole and overall considered the relevant information and factors to be
favorable to, and in support of, its determinations and recommendations.
In the course of its deliberations, our Board considered the following substantive factors as being generally positive or favorable, each of which our
Board believed supported its unanimous decision to proceed with the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby:
•
the potential for the transaction to unlock the significant embedded value in the Company’s LMG business and assets, while providing the
Company’s shareholders with what our Board believes will be a faster time table for realizing that value relative to continuing to pursue the
LMG business plan combined with the NMG business or other strategic alternatives;
•
the total consideration to be received by the Company’s shareholders per share of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B
Stock consisting of (a) $14.51 cash (as contemplated by the Merger Agreement executed on May 3, 2021), which provides the Company’s
shareholders with a significant fixed component of return and liquidity in the near term, and (b) one share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock or
NMG SpinCo Class B Stock;
•
the fact that NMG SpinCo would retain the Company’s MNI business which historically has contributed almost $9 million of EBITDA
annually;
•
the belief of our Board that the combined value of the merger consideration and the NMG SpinCo shares represents superior value to the
Company’s shareholders when compared to other strategic alternatives;
•
the fact that the transaction represents a valuation of the Company’s LMG business and assets at a multiple of 10.5x two-year average
EBITDA;
•
our Board’s understanding of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of the LMG business, as well as our
Board’s belief that the incremental risk in the future of the LMG business had increased due to expected downward pressure on
retransmission revenue as network and MVPD negotiations become more difficult and subscriber counts decline due to cord cutting,
advertising trends and uncertainties, regulatory changes and other factors;
•
the fact that broadcast multiples had declined in the last three years and the pool of potential acquirors could continue to decrease due to
industry consolidation trends and the potential for increased regulatory constraints on ownership of television stations and other media
interests;
52
Table of Contents
•
the fact that the Company’s shareholders in the aggregate will own 100% of the fully diluted shares of NMG SpinCo, which would provide
the Company’s shareholders with continuing participation in the NMG business and its potential growth;
•
the favorable momentum and prospects of NMG as a stand-alone business, with digital growth offsetting print declines and the belief that
moving to report Digital and Magazine as separate segments would create greater clarity and unlock shareholder value as public markets
were not giving NMG enough value for its current business;
•
the facts that NMG SpinCo will retain the “Meredith” name and continue to be headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, will retain the current
voting structure and be traded on NYSE, will continue to be led by Tom Harty as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and management will
be able to focus exclusively on the NMG portfolio and business;
•
the structure of the transaction would allow NMG SpinCo to target 2.0x two-year average EBITDA as a long-term leverage goal to enable
strategic investments in growth platforms (digital, ecommerce, consumer) and return of some level of a cash dividend to attract value
investors to NMG;
•
the fact that the Company had obtained committed debt financing for NMG SpinCo and the limited number and nature of the conditions to
the debt financing;
•
our Board’s belief that the Company had engaged in a fulsome review of strategic alternatives over the past 18 months, with the assistance
of Moelis, which explored solicited and unsolicited interest in potential strategic transactions, including with those parties that were
believed to be the most able and willing to transact;
•
our Board’s belief that the Company had engaged in a fulsome process to obtain the best value reasonably available for the Company’s
shareholders and had created an opportunity for other potentially interested parties to negotiate a transaction with the Company if such
parties were interested in a strategic transaction, and the Gray transaction presented the most favorable opportunity for the Company’s
shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis relative to the potential value that might result from other strategic alternatives available to the
Company given the potential rewards, risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing those other potential alternatives;
•
the fact that this process, even after media reports about it, did not result in any proposals to acquire the Company or the LMG business
that our Board of directors believed were more likely to create greater certainty of value for the Company’s shareholders than the spin-off
and merger with Gray, taking into account risk of execution as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks, and in this regard,
our Board considered the relative favorable and unfavorable aspects of the proposal made by Party D on April 29, 2021 prior to signing the
Merger Agreement on May 3, 2021;
•
the fact that the consideration to be received for each share of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock and other terms
of the Merger Agreement resulted from negotiations between the Company and its legal and financial advisors, on the one hand, and Gray
and its legal and financial advisors, on the other hand, in regular consultation with our senior management and our Board, and our Board’s
belief that the consideration to be received for each share of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock represented the
highest per share consideration that could be negotiated with Gray under the circumstances at that time;
•
the fact that the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock will receive the same consideration per share;
•
the fact that the Merger will be subject to a separate class vote of the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B
Stock, thereby providing each class of the Company shareholders the ability to separately approve or disapprove the transaction;
•
the strong support of the transaction by shareholders representing a substantial majority of the Meredith Class B Stock, who have entered
into a support agreement with Gray to vote in favor of the Merger proposal;
53
Table of Contents
•
the fact that the merger consideration is fixed and will not fluctuate based upon changes in the market price of Gray’s or the Company’s
publicly traded shares;
•
the view of our Board that the transaction with Gray is likely to be consummated and is expected to close during calendar year 2021;
•
the fact that the Company is not expected to recognize U.S. federal income tax at the corporate level in connection with the spin-off of NMG
or sale of LMG, thereby maximizing the value to the Company’s shareholders after repayment of all of the Company’s current debt;
•
the fact that the Company would have been expected to recognize significant U.S. federal income tax at the corporate level in connection
with a direct sale of LMG by the Company in an asset sale transaction;
•
the potential for U.S. federal income tax rates to increase under the current administration and Congress after closing, thereby potentially
increasing the tax benefit to the Company’s shareholders of receiving a tax basis in the NMG SpinCo shares equal to their fair market value
as of the closing and decreasing the tax benefit to the Company’s shareholders of deferring the income tax liability on the NMG SpinCo
shares received at closing;
•
the opinion of Moelis delivered orally on May 3, 2021 at our Board meeting, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated May 3, 2021, addressed to our Board, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications, matters and limitations set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to be
received by the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock in the Merger (as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement executed on May 3, 2021) is fair, from a financial point of view to such holders (other than the Excluded Holders), as more fully
described in “The Merger—Opinion of Meredith’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 77 and the full text of which is attached hereto as
Annex B;
•
the financial condition and resources of Gray and the lack of any financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that Gray had obtained committed debt financing for the full amount of transaction payments (including the merger consideration
and refinancing of the Company’s existing indebtedness) and for the full term of the Merger Agreement (through August 3, 2022) from
reputable commercial banks with significant experience in similar lending transactions and reputations for honoring the terms of their
commitment letters, the limited number and nature of the conditions to the debt financing (which are essentially co-extensive with the
conditions to the Merger), which increases the likelihood of such financings being completed, and the obligation of Gray to use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the debt financing, and the obligation of Gray to pay the Company a $125 million reverse termination fee if the Merger
fails to be consummated as a result of a financing failure;
•
the fact that the Merger is not subject to approval by Gray stockholders;
•
the fact that Gray’s obligations to close the Merger are subject to customary conditions, and our Board’s belief that, while the closing of the
Merger is subject to regulatory approvals from the FCC and DOJ, such approvals were not likely to prevent the closing of the Merger,
especially in light of the facts that Gray is a qualified purchaser with a long record of completing numerous television station acquisitions,
Gray’s position as the proposed buyer could reasonably be expected to attract minor or no opposition at the FCC based on Gray’s record in
prior transactions, Gray management has a history of working constructively to satisfy regulatory requirements if needed, Gray would not
need any regulatory waivers, Gray’s station portfolio has only one market overlap with LMG, and Gray has agreed to use reasonable best
efforts, subject to certain limitations, to take all steps necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals, including committing proactively to
divest its Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station;
•
the view of our Board that third parties would be unlikely to be deterred from making a competing proposal by the provisions of the Merger
Agreement, including because our Board may, under certain
54
Table of Contents
circumstances, furnish information or enter into discussions in connection with a competing proposal. In this regard, our Board of directors
considered that:
•
our Board has the ability under the Merger Agreement to withdraw or modify its recommendation in favor of the approval of adoption
of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, including in connection with a superior proposal or certain intervening events,
and has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances prior to the time that the Company’s shareholders
approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
the structure of the transaction as a spin-off and merger should allow sufficient time for a third party to make a competing proposal if
it desired to do so; and
•
while the Merger Agreement, prior to the amendment, contained a termination fee of $36 million that the Company would be required
to pay Gray under certain circumstances, our Board believed that this fee and the circumstances when such termination fee may be
payable, were reasonable in light of the potential benefit of the Merger, consistent with or lower than fees in comparable transactions
at 1.33% of transaction value, and not preclusive of other offers;
•
that the outside date of May 3, 2022 (which may be extended to August 3, 2022 under certain circumstances) under the Merger Agreement
allows for sufficient time to complete the transaction;
•
the view of the Board that the Gray transaction satisfies the “community interest factors” set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA,
including our Board’s belief that Gray has a long, successful record of operating television stations and will be a good steward for the LMG
business and employees and communities served by the LMG stations;
•
the Company’s ability to request the Delaware Court of Chancery to specifically enforce the Merger Agreement, including with respect to
the debt financing commitments and the consummation of the Merger;
•
the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties,
described under “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 103, which our Board, after consulting with the Company’s legal and financial
advisors, considered to be reasonable and consistent with relevant precedents; and
•
that the Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board of directors, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors
(eight of nine) who are not employees of the Company (and none of whom are affiliated with Gray), and which retained and received advice
from our financial and legal advisors in evaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The Company’s Board of directors was aware of and also considered the following risks and other factors concerning the Merger Agreement and the
transaction as generally negative or unfavorable:
•
the fact that the Company’s shareholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth of the LMG business and would not
benefit from any potential future appreciation in value of the LMG business;
•
that the announcement and pendency of the transaction could result in the disruption of the Company’s business, including the possible
diversion of management and employee attention from other strategic and operational priorities to focus on matters relevant to the
transaction, potential employee attrition and potential adverse effects on the Company’s business relationships;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger, the spin-off and the transactions contemplated
thereby, and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions;
•
risks that any shareholder litigation in connection with the transaction may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and
liability;
55
Table of Contents
•
that the Company is subject to restrictions under the Merger Agreement on the conduct of its LMG business prior to the consummation of
the transaction, requiring the Company to conduct its LMG business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, subject to
specified limitations, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise during the pendency
of the transaction, whether or not the transaction is completed;
•
the possibility that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or that if the transaction is not completed, the Company may
be adversely affected due to potential disruptions in its operations and the trading price of the Meredith Common Stock may be adversely
affected;
•
the possibility that, while the transaction is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
obligations to complete the transaction, including shareholder approval by the Company shareholders, will be satisfied, and as a result, it is
possible that the transaction may not be completed even if approved by the Company shareholders;
•
the possibility that the reverse termination fee payable by Gray is not available in all instances where the Merger Agreement is not
consummated and may be the Company’s only recourse where it is available;
•
if the Merger is not consummated, the spin-off of NMG will also not be consummated;
•
if the Merger is not consummated, the Company may be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement and
transactions contemplated thereby and, if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain approval of the Company’s
shareholders, the Company would be obligated to reimburse Gray for up to $10 million of its expenses in connection with the Merger
Agreement;
•
the possibility that Gray will be unable to obtain all or a portion of the debt financing proceeds contemplated by the debt commitment;
•
the risk that NMG may not meet its financial projections and the possibility that the strategic, operational and financial benefits anticipated
in connection with the transaction might not be realized by NMG SpinCo as a stand-alone company;
•
that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is unable to solicit other competing proposals during the pendency of the
Merger, including any revised proposals from Party D;
•
the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares pursuant to the Merger and the receipt of NMG SpinCo shares pursuant to the spin-
off will be taxable transactions to the Company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
•
the fact that under Iowa law the Company’s common shareholders are not entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of the shares of
common stock.
In addition, the Company’s Board of directors was aware of and considered the interests that certain directors and executive officers may have with
respect to the transaction that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as the Company shareholders, as described in “The Merger—Interests of
Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 85.
Our Board believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the transaction to the Company and its shareholders outweighed the risks, many of which are
mentioned above. Our Board realized, however, that there can be no assurance about future results, including results considered or expected as described
in the factors listed above. The explanation of the reasoning of our Board and all other information in this section are forward-looking in nature and,
therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 42.
Amendment to Merger Agreement
After the Company received an unsolicited proposal from a third party after announcement of the Merger Agreement on May 3, 2021 (as further
described in “The Merger—Background of the Merger” beginning on
56
Table of Contents
page 58), the Company and Gray began negotiations regarding a potential amendment to the Merger Agreement, which subsequently resulted in an
amendment executed on June 2, 2021. At its meeting on June 1, 2021, the Company’s Board of directors unanimously (a) determined that the amended
Merger Agreement (as amended by the amendment executed on June 2, 2021) and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are
advisable, (b) determined that the amended Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, taken together, are at a
price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on the Company’s shareholders as well as
the effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c) approved the execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of the amended Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (d) resolved
to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of the amended Merger Agreement and thereby the Merger.
In its evaluation of the amended Merger Agreement and the transaction, our Board consulted with the Company’s senior management as well as legal and
financial advisors to the Company, and considered a number of factors, including the factors discussed above and below, which our Board believed
supported its unanimous decision to proceed with the amended Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby:
•
the fact that the amended Merger Agreement increased the total consideration to be received by the Company’s shareholders per share of
the Meredith Common Stock and the Meredith Class B Stock from $14.51 cash to $16.99 cash (an increase of more than 17%);
•
the facts that revised merger consideration of $16.99 per share in cash in the amended Merger Agreement was an increase from the original
merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash and that Moelis had previously rendered its written opinion, dated as of May 3, 2021, to the
Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, matters and limitations set forth therein, the
original merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to be received by the holders of the Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B
Stock (other than the Excluded Holders) in the Merger was fair from a financial point of view to such holders (other than the Excluded
Holders) (see the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Meredith’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 77 and the full text of which
is attached hereto as Annex B);
•
our Board’s belief that the increased merger consideration in the amendment constituted Gray’s best and final offer and represented the
highest per share consideration that could be negotiated with Gray under the circumstances at that time;
•
after reviewing the relative favorable and unfavorable aspects of the Gray proposal and the proposal made by Party D on May 26, 2021, our
Board’s belief that the Gray transaction continued to present the most favorable opportunity for the Company’s shareholders on a risk-
adjusted basis taking into account certainty of value, regulatory considerations, path to closing, expected timing and other factors;
•
while the amended Merger Agreement contains a break fee of $113 million that the Company would be required to pay Gray under certain
circumstances, our Board’s belief that Gray would not have agreed to the increased merger consideration without the Company’s
acceptance of this fee and that the break fee and the circumstances when such fee may be payable, were reasonable in light of the increased
merger consideration negotiated with Gray, were consistent with fees in comparable transactions at 4% of transaction value, and were not
preclusive of other offers;
•
the fact that the amended Merger Agreement does not contain the “force the vote” provision or the station purchase option initially
proposed by Gray as a condition for the increased merger consideration;
•
while the amended Merger Agreement contains a termination fee of $73 million that the Company would be required to pay Gray if the
closing is not consummated in certain circumstances as a result of NMG SpinCo’s inability to obtain the its debt financing, our Board’s
belief that Gray would not have
57
Table of Contents
agreed to the increased merger consideration without the Company’s acceptance of this fee, that the termination fee and the circumstances
when such fee may be payable, were reasonable in light of the increased merger consideration negotiated with Gray, that the Company had
fully committed financing mitigated the risk that such fee would become payable, and that Gray’s corresponding termination fee was $125
million.
Background of the Merger",59,66
MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
In the ordinary course of business, our Board and our senior management actively review strategic alternatives that might be available to enhance
shareholder value and engage in discussions with other companies in the television broadcasting, digital media, and publishing industries concerning
possible strategic transactions, acquisitions of businesses and brands, commercial collaborations, and joint ventures.
As a result of these reviews, on January 31, 2018, the Company acquired Time, Inc. to create the leading multi-platform media company, to accelerate the
Company’s digital position by adding significant scale, and to provide advertising and consumer revenue diversification and growth.
Effective February 1, 2018, our Board appointed Tom Harty as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Over the next two years, the Company focused on the integration of the core brands and titles acquired in the Time Inc. acquisition and completed the
divestiture of non-core assets (including the TIME, FORTUNE and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED brands and the Company’s investments in Viant and Xumo)
to focus on brands serving its core audience of American women.
In Fall 2019, the Company had preliminary discussions with a few private equity firms regarding possible strategic transactions, but the discussions did
not advance beyond preliminary discussions and no transactions resulted.
During the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 crisis created an extremely challenging business environment for the Company and our industry as a whole,
including significant advertising campaign cancellations and delays. On April 2, 2020, the closing price of the Company’s shares fell to a 52-week low of
$10.81. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company focused on proactively taking aggressive actions to strengthen the Company’s liquidity
and enhance the Company’s financial flexibility. Among other actions, the Company paused its common stock dividend, implemented a series of
operational cost-control measures, reduced capital expenditures and worked with customers and suppliers to optimize working capital.
In May 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss strategic options for our LMG business segment, including the potential sale of select
broadcast stations and a potential sale of all of LMG. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated in the meeting.
The select station group included the stations in St. Louis, Missouri (DMA #23), Mobile, Alabama-Pensacola, Florida (DMA #57), Flint-Saginaw-Bay
City, Michigan (DMA #77), and Springfield-Holyoke, Massachusetts (DMA #111)). Our management expected the comparatively high tax basis of this
station group to maximize after-tax proceeds to pay down the Company’s debt and reduce leverage. Representatives of Moelis discussed the potential for
strong demand for the entire LMG station group given the number of parties who were interested in expanding their television station holdings prior to
the onset of COVID-19 and highlighted the potential for interested buyers of the select stations to pursue a transaction for all of LMG. Our senior
management and representatives of Moelis reviewed an illustrative timeline and key workstreams that would be required for a sale of LMG and a
concurrent separation of our NMG business segment.
While focusing on the COVID-related business impact and challenges, our Board and senior management continued to evaluate additional actions it
could take to strengthen the Company’s liquidity and enhance its financial flexibility. In June 2020, the Company used the net proceeds from an offering
of senior secured notes and incremental term loans to redeem in full the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and lower its overall cost of capital.
58Table of Contents
Subsequent to the May 2020 Board meeting, the Company formally engaged Moelis to begin preparations for marketing the select station group after
Labor Day 2020 depending on market conditions. In order to preserve the option of pursuing a sale of LMG in the event potential buyers expanded
conversations beyond the four stations, Moelis and the Company’s primary outside legal counsel Cooley LLP (“Cooley”) also continued analysis and
preparations for a potential divestiture of LMG and a spin-off of NMG. Our Board requested Moelis’ assistance based on the Company’s longstanding
relationship with Moelis, as well as Moelis’ extensive expertise and experience advising media companies in connection with potential strategic
transactions. Both Moelis and Cooley had advised the Company and our Board on a number of our prior strategic transactions (including the Time Inc.
acquisition) and had been advising the Company in connection with the Company’s ongoing review of long-term strategic alternatives.
After a thorough review of various potential transaction structures, we determined that a spin-off of NMG SpinCo (holding the Company’s NMG
business segment and corporate functions) into an independent, publicly traded company, with a simultaneous sale of LMG RemainCo (the Meredith
Corporation legal entity then owning the LMG segment only) in a stock transaction would be the most tax-efficient structure while balancing other
business and legal considerations. Given the Company’s comparatively higher tax basis in the legacy Time Inc. entities, a spin-off of the NMG business
and assets was expected to result in no or very limited corporate level tax. By contrast, a sale of LMG in a direct asset sale by the Company was expected
to result in significant corporate level tax based on the Company’s comparatively lower tax basis in the LMG business and assets. Our management and
advisors also began to evaluate the desired capital structure of a pro forma stand-alone NMG SpinCo.
In July 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss two strategic initiatives. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis
and Cooley also participated. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley provided our Board with an update on the potential select station sale process.
Representatives of Cooley introduced a potential amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation. The proposed amendment would fix a technical
issue and clarify the Company’s ability to execute a separation of LMG and NMG in a tax-efficient manner and preserve the Company’s existing voting
structure in a stand-alone NMG SpinCo. Specifically, the proposed amendment would clarify the Company’s ability to make distributions to the holders of
the Company’s common stock and class B stock in separate classes of capital stock of a spin-off subsidiary in order to preserve the voting rights
currently held by both classes of shareholders in a stand-alone NMG SpinCo.
On August 10 and 11, 2020, our Board held its regular quarterly meeting. Members of our senior management also participated. Our Board decided to
move forward with the amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation for formal consideration at a subsequent Board meeting. Our Board also
considered the optimal timing for the select station sale process relative to the potential amendment and discussed a potential sale of LMG.
On August 24, 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to consider the amendment further. Members of our senior management and representatives of
Moelis and Cooley also participated. Our Board formally approved the proposed amendment to the Company’s articles of incorporation subject to
shareholder approval at the annual shareholders meeting scheduled to be held in November 2020. Our Board decided to seek the amendment ahead of
commencing any strategic transaction and, accordingly, determined to wait to commence marketing the select station sale until after the November annual
shareholders meeting.
On September 9, 2020, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC to submit the amendment proposal to a vote of the Company’s
shareholders at the annual meeting scheduled for November 11, 2020, and the Company subsequently filed the definitive proxy statement with the SEC on
September 25, 2020.
On November 10, 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the television broadcast industry, and an overview, analysis and considerations
for the select station sale process. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated. Representatives of Moelis
presented our Board with
59
Table of Contents
market data and financial information regarding the potential select station sales. Our Board considered certain key benefits that could be provided by the
divestitures, including the ability to delever the Company’s balance sheet by selling high tax basis assets, the high probability of success given the
quality of assets, improving station performance coming out of COVID-19 and strong political advertising revenue, the potential to eliminate regulatory
overlaps with potential future buyers of LMG, and the expectation that the select divestitures should have no negative impact on the appeal of a larger
LMG transaction. Subsequent to the meeting, our Board authorized our senior management and advisors to move forward with the marketing of the select
station sales, to commence buyer outreach and solicit initial indications of interest.
On November 11, 2020, at the Company’s annual shareholders meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposed amendment to the
Company’s articles of incorporation as described above.
Commencing November 16, 2020 and over the next several weeks, representatives of Moelis contacted 20 parties (including Gray) and several expressed
interest in certain of the select stations and potentially all four. The contacted parties included all of the publicly-traded broadcasters (including Gray) as
well as other broadcasters and broadcast investors considered most likely to have potential interest. The Company entered into confidentiality
agreements with 17 parties (including Gray) who had expressed interest in a transaction with the Company. The confidentiality agreements contained
customary standstill and fall-away provisions. The counterparties were invited to review preliminary financial and due diligence information regarding the
four select stations and submit preliminary indications of interest by December 17, 2020.
On December 21, 2020, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated in the
meeting. Representatives of Moelis provided current perspectives on the television broadcast industry and an update on the select station sale process.
Representatives of Moelis noted the continued strong recovery in pacings and record political advertising generated by the 2020 election races.
Representatives of Moelis also noted that overall M&A activity was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted by the Scripps—ION Media
merger announced in September and the recent launch of another process to sell a television broadcaster’s station portfolio. Representatives of Moelis
reported to our Board that, of the 20 parties contacted, four submitted first round bids. Two parties bid for all four stations: a strategic party referred to as
Party A, and a private equity sponsor which had acquired a station group and spoken with the Company in Fall 2019, referred to as Party B. Another
strategic party, referred to as Party C, bid on the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station only. An investment firm with a portfolio company that currently owned a
small station group, referred to as Party D, bid on the Mobile- Pensacola and Flint-Saginaw-Bay City stations. Gray did not submit a proposal for only the
select four station group at this time. Overall, the four bids indicated a total value range of $511-$631 million for the four station group.
In addition, Gray, Party A and Party B indicated interest in potentially acquiring LMG in a stock transaction after a simultaneous spin-off of NMG, with an
indicative enterprise value range of $2.5-$2.8 billion. Gray indicated a value range of $2.5-$2.7 billion in an all cash transaction. Party A indicated a value
range of $2.6-$2.8 billion. Party B indicated a value range of $2.5-$2.75 billion in a combination of cash and stock to be determined. All of the proposals
were non-binding and subject to customary diligence review and third-party debt financing.
Subsequent to the meeting, our Board instructed our senior management and advisors to provide select, value-driving information to parties who
expressed interest in a LMG transaction while proceeding with the next phase of the select station process. Each of the parties that submitted first round
proposals for the select stations was invited to participate in the second round and granted full data room access. Over the next several weeks, the
Company and Moelis addressed the parties’ diligence questions and scheduled diligence calls with our LMG management team.
On January 12, 2021, on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Company, representatives of Moelis invited Gray, Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D to
submit final offers for the select station group no later than
60
Table of Contents
January 25, 2021. The parties were asked to submit markups of a proposed asset purchase agreement with their final bids. At the direction of the
Company, representatives of Moelis also invited Gray, Party A and Party B to submit proposals to acquire LMG by the same date.
Pending receipt of final bids for the select station group, the Company’s management and advisors continued to analyze a potential sale of LMG and
simultaneous spin-off of NMG. This included consideration of the tax and shareholder value implications, a transaction timetable and key workstreams,
legal and operational issues associated with separating the businesses and allocating assets and liabilities and employee plans and arrangements,
potential costs associated with refinancing the Company’s debt, potential change in control triggers under employee plans and arrangements, and the
capital structure and financing requirements for NMG SpinCo.
On January 21, 2021, the Company received preliminary markups of the asset purchase agreement from Gray, Party A, Party C and Party D. Party B did not
submit a markup on this date. On January 23, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided preliminary feedback to Gray,
Party A, Party C and Party D on certain of the provisions included in their markups which, if addressed, could make their final bids more competitive and
in line with markups received from other parties. In particular, Moelis communicated that adding closing conditionality and post-closing indemnification
obligations would be negatively viewed and put bids at a competitive disadvantage.
On January 25 and 26, 2021, the Company received five (including one from Gray) final indications of interest for the select stations and two (including
one from Gray) revised preliminary indications of interest for LMG.
Gray proposed to purchase the select station group (other than the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station) for $425 million in cash as a first step in acquiring
LMG immediately following a spin-off of NMG. Gray proposed to purchase for cash all of the stock of LMG RemainCo based on an enterprise value of
$2.6-$2.7 billion and certain other assumptions (an increase from its prior low end range of $2.5 billion). Gray’s proposal contemplated the divestiture of
Meredith’s Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station, WNEM, to address FCC rules that would prohibit Gray from owning both stations in the market. Gray
indicated that it was prepared to move forward with the acquisition of LMG RemainCo on a public-company deal basis, that is with no survival of the
representations and warranties regarding LMG RemainCo. Gray indicated that it would finance the LMG RemainCo acquisition with a combination of cash
on hand and new debt and that its final proposal for a LMG RemainCo acquisition would not have any financing contingencies. Gray’s proposals to
acquire the select station group and LMG were subject to completion of certain due diligence items and agreement on acceptable contract terms.
Party A proposed to purchase all four stations of the select station group for $560 million in cash and pledged to provide executed debt financing
commitment letters from lenders shortly thereafter.
Party B proposed to purchase the select station group for $510 million in cash. Additionally, Party B reconfirmed its interest in acquiring LMG RemainCo
in a cash/stock transaction based on an enterprise value of $2.5-$2.7 billion (a reduction from its prior high end range of $2.75 billion). Party B planned to
finance the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, new equity and new debt. Party B did not submit a markup of the asset purchase agreement,
and its proposal was subject to completion of due diligence and agreement on contract terms. Party B expressed an interest in having the Company’s
shareholders retain an ownership interest in LMG RemainCo in order for LMG RemainCo to remain a public company after the sale.
Party C proposed to acquire the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station for $63 million in cash, subject to completion of final confirmatory due diligence.
Party D proposed to acquire the Mobile-Pensacola station for $61 million in cash or both the Mobile-Pensacola and Flint-Saginaw-Bay City stations for
$146 million in cash. Party D’s offer was subject to
61
Table of Contents
completion of confirmatory due diligence and agreement on contract terms. Party D indicated that it expected to have sufficient funds available so that its
final offer would not be subject to any financing contingency.
On January 28, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis also participated.
Representatives of Moelis reviewed the current stock price performance of pure-play broadcasters and its current views on the M&A environment.
Moelis also updated our Board on the final bids for the select station group. The highest value combination from the bids received represented $583
million. Representatives of Moelis also updated our Board on the Gray and Party B proposals to acquire LMG RemainCo.
At this meeting, members of the Company’s senior management also reviewed with our Board an overview of potential scenarios to provide optionality
for debt paydown, resumption of a dividend and earnings growth (including a case assuming no strategic transaction, a case assuming the sale of the
select station group, and a case assuming a sale of LMG). Our senior management also reviewed with our Board an overview of illustrative shareholder
value over time under the various cases, taking into account illustrative share prices, projected dividends, and cash merger consideration from the sale of
LMG, based on various cash flow, trading multiple and other assumptions. Our senior management also reviewed with our Board an overview of the
capital allocation implications of the various cases based on various debt pay-down, dividend and cash generation assumptions. Our senior management
also reviewed with our Board an updated three-year outlook based on post-COVID recovery and other assumptions and discussed the prospects and
execution risks of the NMG business on a stand-alone basis and the prospects and execution risks of the LMG business based on the Company’s
performance and macro-industry factors.
After full discussion and based on current values being indicated by potential acquirors, our Board decided to pause the select station sale process at
that time and instructed our senior management and advisors to focus their efforts on advancing preparations and discussions for a potential LMG sale
and spin-off of NMG. Our senior management and Board also determined that it would be advisable to convene recurring special meetings going forward
in order for our senior management and advisors to provide frequent updates to our Board regarding the status of a potential transaction opportunity and
related preparations and discussions.
On February 1, 2021, Gray announced its acquisition of Quincy Media, Inc. and its television station group for $925 million in cash.
On February 5, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis also
participated. At this meeting, our senior management reviewed several factors weighing in favor of a transaction for LMG: the number of viable buyers
would become smaller as consolidation continues across the broadcast industry (noting the Gray-Quincy transaction); with the change in presidential
administration, the future FCC regulatory outlook could be more limiting for a LMG transaction; the prospect of higher tax rates could negatively impact
the Company and shareholders; and executing a sale of LMG would materially reduce the Company’s debt, thus providing capacity for investment in the
NMG business. Moelis provided an update on the Gray-Quincy transaction and the status of discussions with potential counterparties regarding a LMG
transaction. Representatives of a consulting firm with expertise in the media, entertainment and communications industries also participated in part of the
meeting and provided its perspectives on the current broadcast landscape for 2021.
During the month of February, the Company’s management, Moelis and Cooley continued to analyze and advance a transaction timetable and key
workstreams involved in a potential sale of LMG and a spin-off of NMG. The Company continued to advance conversations with potential lenders
regarding NMG SpinCo’s capital structure and indicative debt financing terms. Our management and advisors also continued work on a data room and
diligence process for a sale of LMG with the potential bidders and prepared drafts of definitive agreements for a spin-off and sale transaction to be shared
with potential bidders in an auction process. The Company and Moelis also agreed on a transaction fee for a LMG sale and formally amended their
engagement letter accordingly.

Table of Contents
On February 12, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also
participated. Representatives of Moelis provided an update on the sale process and diligence activity by Gray and Party B and their advisors and
potential lenders. Moelis noted that Party B had indicated that it needed additional time to further review possible transaction structures and the
cash/stock consideration mix. Representatives of Moelis also reviewed the transaction structure and steps for an illustrative spin-off of NMG and sale of
LMG from a financial point of view. Representatives of Cooley reviewed with our Board certain legal matters including our directors’ fiduciary duties in
connection with its consideration of a potential strategic transaction involving a spin-off of NMG and sale of LMG. Representatives of Moelis and
Cooley also reviewed with our Board an updated illustrative timeline for the various workstreams to signing for a spin-off and sale transaction.
On February 19, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley
also participated. Representatives of Moelis led a discussion of an illustrative timeline for soliciting and processing final bids from LMG bidders. Our
senior management led a discussion through various scenarios including ranges for longer term LMG valuation if the Company were to continue to
pursue its combined NMG-LMG business plan, ranges for a potential one-time transaction payment if the Company were to complete a sale of LMG, and
illustrative capital structures for NMG SpinCo and capacity for future investment and dividends if the Company were to separate NMG from LMG.
On February 26, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley
also participated. Our senior management led a discussion that included a preliminary investor relations and communications plan around a potential
spin-off and sale transaction and a new Meredith company focused exclusively on our National Media Group.
Also on February 26, 2021, and again on March 5, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley spoke with representatives of Party B and its advisors to
discuss various aspects of structuring the sale transaction. Also on March 5, Deloitte Tax LLP (“Deloitte”), tax advisors to the Company, spoke with
representatives of Party B and its accountants to discuss the NMG-LMG separation steps in more detail.
On March 11, 2021, the Company received a written non-binding letter of interest from Party D to acquire LMG in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction
involving the spin-off of LMG (rather than NMG) and simultaneous combination of the LMG stations with stations owned by the Party D portfolio
company and additional stations from a party subsequently identified as a publicly-traded broadcaster referred to herein as Party E. Party D’s proposal
included $2.5 billion of cash consideration (to refinance the Company’s debt and make a cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders) and a 50.7%
ownership interest for the Company’s existing shareholders in the new combined company. The proposal indicated that the new combined company
would initially have a total net leverage of 6.75x pro forma EBITDA. Party D indicated its belief that the Company’s shareholders would only be taxed at
closing on the cash dividend received, with any income tax on the value of the NMG SpinCo shares received in the spin-off distribution and the stock
received in the new combined company being deferred until a future taxable event. The proposal was subject to completion of diligence and reverse
diligence to confirm synergies.
On March 15, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed Party D’s proposal with the Company’s senior management. They discussed the
potential benefits and considerations of the proposal, including the indicated tax treatment, the consideration mix, that the stock ownership would be in a
highly-levered company, and that it introduced a higher degree of complexity, requiring a spin-off of LMG rather than NMG and making the transaction
conditional on the consummation of a separate, third-party transaction.
On March 16, 2021, as directed by the Company, Moelis granted Party D access to a limited data room to finalize its indication of interest.
On March 17, 2021, on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Company, representatives of Moelis provided process letters to Gray and Party B and invited
them to submit final offers for LMG no later than April 14, 2021.

Representatives of Moelis also provided drafts of the proposed Merger Agreement and Separation and Distribution Agreement. The parties were asked
to submit markups by April 1, 2021 prior to their final bids. Among other terms, the proposed agreements included (1) customary exceptions to the “no
shop” covenant to permit our Board to consider unsolicited alternative proposals consistent with its fiduciary duties, (2) the right of our Board to change
its recommendation and terminate the agreements in certain circumstances relating to acceptance of a superior proposal, subject to payment to the
acquiror of a break fee equal to 3% of the transaction value paid to the Company’s shareholders, (3) customary matching rights for the acquiror, (4)
requirements for the acquiror to take certain specified actions to obtain regulatory approvals, (5) the right of the parties to extend the end date of the
agreements to up to 15 months from signing if necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, (6) requirements for the acquiror to deliver fully committed
financing at signing and take certain specified actions to obtain its third-party financing by the scheduled closing date, (7) a requirement for the acquiror
to pay a reverse termination fee of $125 million if the transaction were terminated due to the acquiror’s breach or a failure of the acquiror’s financing to be
funded, (8) a public-style deal for the sale of LMG RemainCo without the survival of representations and warranties, (9) the acquisition of the Company’s
MNI business by the acquiror as an asset of LMG RemainCo, (10) the assumption by NMG SpinCo of liabilities associated with the NMG business
segment and Corporate functions and the retention by LMG RemainCo of liabilities associated with the LMG business segment, subject to certain
exceptions and mutual indemnities, (11) conditionality of the LMG sale transaction on the consummation of the spin-off of NMG and the consummation
of the funding of the NMG SpinCo debt financing, (12) the allocation of the Company’s debt between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo by providing
that NMG SpinCo would borrow new funds at closing and make a cash payment to LMG RemainCo such that the net debt of LMG RemainCo (after giving
effect to the cash payment) would be equal to an amount to be agreed by the parties before signing, and (13) a cash merger payment to the Company’s
shareholders in the amount of the total purchase price less the amount of net debt allocated to LMG RemainCo.
On March 19, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also
participated. Representatives of Moelis provided an update on the increase in trading multiples in the broadcast industry. Representatives of Moelis also
provided an update on the LMG sale process and the proposal received from Party D. The Board asked questions about the proposal, and the discussion
noted that additional information and analysis would be required to fully evaluate the parties, structure, timing, regulatory implications, and potential
market reaction to the ownership interest to be retained by the Company’s shareholders in the new combined company, among other aspects of the
proposal.
On March 20, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided drafts of the proposed Merger Agreement schedules, Tax
Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement to Gray and Party B. At the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided a draft
of the proposed Employee Matters Agreement to Gray and Party B on March 25, 2021.
Pending receipt of final bids, the Company and advisors continued to work with Gray and Party B to address diligence questions and responses. Our
management and advisors also continued to analyze the Reverse Morris Trust transaction structure proposed by Party D, including the tax and
regulatory implications, as well as consider a realistic timetable for a transaction with Party D based on their later start, the additional transaction
complexity, and the need for the Company to perform due diligence on Party D’s business. This “reverse” diligence was necessary because Party D’s
proposal contemplated the Company shareholders holding shares in a new combined company.
On March 23, 2021, Party B communicated that it intended to submit an all-cash bid after completing its analysis of structure and other elements of the
transaction.
On March 30, 2021, on behalf of, and at the direction of, the Company, representatives of Moelis provided drafts of all of the transaction agreements to
Party D. Subject to further discussions regarding transaction structure, the drafts provided for the spin-off of NMG as contemplated by the drafts
previously shared with Gray and Party B and provided for an all-cash merger. Representatives of Moelis invited Party D to mark the
64
Table of Contents
agreements to reflect its final structure proposal and requested markups by April 8, 2021. On March 31, 2021, at the direction of the Company, Moelis
provided to Party D an illustrative transaction structure reflecting the Company’s preference for a spin-off of NMG rather than LMG. Moelis also
provided a list of high priority due diligence requests, which would enable the Company to perform reverse diligence on Party D’s business.
On April 2, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also
participated and reviewed with our Board the status of the key transaction workstreams for the spin-off and sale, and an illustrative timeline for the next
stages of a transaction. Also on April 2, Gray’s legal advisors, Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP (“Eversheds”), submitted markups of each of the
transaction agreements on behalf of Gray. Also on April 2, Party D’s legal advisors submitted a revised transaction structure proposal.
Later that day, April 2, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley participated on a call with legal counsel for Party D and discussed a Morris Trust
transaction structure involving the spin-off of NMG that would make Party D’s proposal more attractive to the Company.
On April 7, 2021, representatives of Cooley and Moelis reviewed a preliminary list of business and legal issues presented by Gray’s markups of the
transaction agreements with members of our senior management. Among other items, they noted certain provisions that would need to be negotiated if
the Company were to move forward with a potential transaction with Gray, including (1) how debt and certain liabilities would be allocated between NMG
SpinCo and LMG RemainCo, (2) Gray’s proposal not to acquire or pay for the Company’s MNI business, (3) certain provisions that could affect closing
timing and certainty, (4) certain provisions that would negatively affect our Board’s ability to consider unsolicited proposals after signing, including
changes to the definition of superior proposal, an increase of the break fee payable by the Company to 5% of the transaction value paid to the
Company’s shareholders, and the addition of an option for Gray to purchase certain stations at an economic discount upon the Company’s acceptance of
a competing proposal; and (5) a reduction of the reverse termination fee payable by Gray in certain events from $125 million to 5% of the transaction value
paid to the Company’s shareholders.
Also on April 7, representatives of Deloitte, Moelis and Cooley spoke again with Party D’s legal advisors to discuss aspects of the separation, spin-off
and merger transactions structure and steps.
On April 8, 2021, Party D’s legal advisors submitted a markup of the Merger Agreement on behalf of Party D, but did not provide markups of any of the
other transaction agreements. The markup of the Merger Agreement was subject to completion of diligence and transaction structure and Party D’s
financing structure and commitment letters. Among other comments, Party D indicated the $125 million reverse termination fee would be reduced but did
not include a counter proposal.
On April 9, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also
participated. This meeting focused on a business update from our senior management and further discussion regarding the business rationale and
communications plan for the separation and spin-off of NMG and sale of LMG.
On April 11, 2021, representatives of Cooley and Moelis spoke with representatives of Gray’s legal advisors, Eversheds, and financial advisors, Wells
Fargo Securities LLC (“Wells Fargo”), to provide feedback on behalf of the Company in advance of Gray’s final bid regarding certain business and legal
issues presented by Gray’s initial markups of the transaction agreements and to discuss certain diligence-related matters.
On April 12, 2021, representatives of Cooley and Eversheds spoke further regarding certain legal matters under the transaction agreements in advance of
Gray’s final bid.

Table of Contents
On April 13, 2021, Party D’s legal advisors submitted a revised transaction structure proposal that reflected a Morris Trust transaction involving the spin-
off of NMG and the sale of LMG RemainCo. The proposal also reflected that Party E would be contributing television stations to the new combined
company in exchange for an ownership interest rather than selling the stations to the new company for cash.
On April 14, 2021, Gray submitted a proposal to purchase all of the stock of LMG RemainCo for cash based on an enterprise value of $2.45 billion (a
decrease from its prior range of $2.6-$2.7 billion). Gray’s proposal continued to exclude the Company’s MNI business (which would be retained by NMG
SpinCo). Gray’s proposal was supported by debt financing commitment letters from lenders. Gray confirmed it had completed substantive diligence and
committed to divest its Flint-Saginaw-Bay City station to address regulatory requirements. Gray’s proposal was accompanied by the same markups of the
transaction agreements which it had previously provided on April 2, 2021.
On April 14, 2021, Party B also submitted a proposal to purchase all of the stock of LMG RemainCo for cash based on an enterprise value of $2.3 billion (a
decrease from its prior range of $2.5-$2.7 billion). Under Party B’s proposal, Party B would acquire the Company’s MNI business as an asset of LMG
RemainCo. Party B submitted a markup of the Merger Agreement and an issues list for the other transaction agreements. Party B’s proposal was
supported by debt financing commitment letters from lenders. Party B confirmed it had completed substantive diligence and, to address regulatory
requirements, Party B committed to divest a station in the one overlap market presented by the proposed transaction.
On April 15, 2021, Party D submitted a proposal for a Morris Trust transaction reflecting $2.5 billion in cash consideration (to refinance the Company’s
debt and make a cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders) and a 50.8% ownership interest for the Company’s shareholders in the new combined
company. Under Party D’s proposal, Party D would acquire the Company’s MNI business as an asset of LMG RemainCo. Party D reconfirmed its belief
that the receipt of stock of NMG SpinCo in the spin-off distribution and receipt of stock of the new combined company in the merger transaction would
not be taxable to the Company’s shareholders at closing. The proposed financing included $2.050 billion of debt financing and $570 million of equity
financing in the form of junior capital or preferred stock, representing a total net leverage for the new combined company of 7.0x two-year average
2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred financing. Party D submitted “highly confident” letters from its proposed lenders but
indicated it would need up to three weeks to obtain fully committed financing. The proposal did not include commitments for the equity financing. Party
D also indicated that it was still in the process of negotiating with Party E. Party D did not provide any further markups of the transaction agreements
beyond the markup of the Merger Agreement previously submitted on April 8, 2021.
On April 16, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also
participated and reviewed each of the proposals with our Board, as well as potential responses and next steps for each party. After discussion of the key
terms, benefits and drawbacks of each proposal and how they compared to each other, our Board determined that none of the proposals were adequate
based on their current terms. Among other considerations, the discussion focused on certainty of value and the amount of cash payable to the
Company’s shareholders, path to closing and expected timing, perspectives on the value and monetization of the MNI business if retained by NMG
SpinCo, and the regulatory implications and increased possibility of delay of a transaction with Party D and Party E given the additional scrutiny a
transaction with these parties would likely face from the FCC and interest groups based on the complexity of their proposal, their ownership interests in
other broadcasters and broadcast assets, and their track records in prior transactions.
After discussion, our Board instructed representatives of Moelis to communicate to Gray and Party B that they would need to increase their value
proposals significantly and address other contract terms if they desired to be successful in potentially acquiring LMG and ask them to resubmit
proposals by April 20, 2021. Our Board also instructed the Company’s advisors to continue to analyze Party D’s proposal, including the value and reverse
66
Table of Contents
diligence elements and regulatory implications, and continue their work to validate the indicated tax treatment and tax opinions. Our Board also instructed
representatives of Moelis to communicate to Party D that it would need to advance its proposal to catch up with the other parties, deliver firm financing
commitments, increase the cash component and clarify certain elements of value and sources and uses, and address certain regulatory questions and
concerns. Later that day, representatives of Moelis spoke separately with representatives of Gray, Party B and Party D to communicate the messages
discussed at the Board meeting.
On April 18, 2021, representatives of Moelis provided to Gray and Party B a quarterly update on the LMG business and a list of certain items that would
need to be addressed in a revised bid, including matters relating to the retention of certain liabilities by LMG RemainCo, closing timing and certainty,
certain deal protection and fiduciary out elements, including the amount of the break fee payable to the acquiror in the event the Company accepts a
superior proposal, and the amount of the reverse termination fee payable to the Company in the event of a breach or financing failure by the acquiror.
On April 19, 2021, Gray submitted a revised proposal for $2.65 billion in cash (up from $2.45 billion and still based on NMG SpinCo retaining the MNI
business). Gray confirmed its view that it would obtain all approvals required for closing expeditiously and would close in calendar year 2021. Gray
reduced the break fee payable by the Company under certain circumstances to $36 million and agreed to pay the $125 million reverse termination fee if the
transaction were terminated due to Gray’s breach or a failure of Gray’s financing. Gray also provided revised financing commitments for the full increased
purchase price.
On April 20, 2021, Party B submitted a revised proposal for $2.33 billion in cash (up from $2.3 billion). The proposal was otherwise materially unchanged
from its April 14, 2021 proposal (including that Party B would be acquiring the MNI business).
On April 21, 2021, representatives of Cooley spoke with Party D’s regulatory counsel to discuss specific questions our senior management and advisors
had about the regulatory implications of Party D’s proposal, and how Party D planned to comply with FCC regulatory requirements and obtain FCC
consent for the transaction and Party D’s assessment of the time required to obtain such consent.
On April 22, 2021, a Moelis representative met with a principal of Party D. The principal expressed Party D’s continuing interest in a transaction with the
Company. The Moelis representative communicated that Party D should put its best offer forward and indicated that the Company continued to have
questions regarding the total cash and stock value of the proposal and continued to have concerns regarding Party D’s financing and regulatory timing
and closing certainty. The principal suggested that Party D may be willing to agree to a regulatory break fee or ticking fee in the event of a regulatory
failure or delay. Later that day, the Party D principal communicated to the Moelis representative that it was working to improve its offer.
On April 23, 2021, Party D submitted a revised Morris Trust proposal providing for $2.56 billion cash consideration (up from $2.50 billion, to refinance the
Company’s debt and make a cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders) and 50.8% of the combined equity in the new combined company to be held
by the Company’s shareholders. The proposal was otherwise materially unchanged from its April 15, 2021 proposal (including that Party D would be
acquiring the MNI business).
On April 23, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also
participated. Our senior management reviewed the current state of the LMG business and senior management’s perspectives on the go forward risks for
the LMG business. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed the key economic and contract terms of each current proposal (Gray’s revised April
19, 2021 proposal, Party B’s revised April 20 proposal, and Party D’s April 23, 2021 proposal). The discussion included a comparison of the key elements
of each proposal, including certainty of value, their respective regulatory profiles, path to close and timing. The discussion also included the implications
of NMG SpinCo retaining the MNI business, perspectives on how the equity in the combined company under
67
Table of Contents
Party D’s proposal could be valued and trade, the potential benefits to the Company’s shareholders of tax deferral versus a stepped-up tax basis in the
NMG SpinCo shares, and community interests such as employees.
Our Board discussed in detail the perspective of our senior management and advisors that, while a potential Gray transaction could reasonably be
expected to obtain relatively prompt regulatory approvals and ultimately be consummated prior to the end of 2021, a transaction with Party D and Party E
presented greater regulatory complexity and potential for opposition leading to the possibility of significant delay in the review and approval process,
increasing the risk of pushing closing into 2022. Key considerations with respect to Gray included (1) the comparatively clean regulatory profile of the
Gray transaction, with only one market overlap in Flint-Saginaw-Bay City and no requirement for any regulatory waivers, (2) Gray’s long record of
completing numerous television station acquisitions, (3) a reasonable chance that Gray’s FCC applications would not be opposed, and (4) Gray’s senior
management’s record of working constructively to satisfy regulatory requirements. With respect to Party D’s proposal, our Board considered the
relatively higher regulatory risk arising from (1) the greater regulatory complexity of the transaction involving Party D and Party E, (2) the higher risk that
Party D’s or Party E’s FCC applications would be opposed, resulting in increased scrutiny by the FCC and delay, particularly as a result of Party E’s
disclosed participation in the transaction, (3) the negative record of Party E with the FCC with respect to certain compliance matters; (4) prior expressions
of concern by current FCC leadership about Party E, and (5) Party D’s proposed contractual allocation of regulatory risk, which merely matched the
regulatory efforts provisions in the proposed Gray Merger Agreement. Our Board also considered the fact that Party E had not provided a formal
proposal on a regulatory break fee which would be payable by Party E if regulatory approval were not obtained.
Our senior management and advisors also reviewed with our Board potential responses to the proposals. After discussion, our Board determined that
Gray’s proposal was stronger than the other proposals in terms of value and other key elements. Our Board also considered that Gray was likely weeks
ahead of Party D in its ability to execute a transaction and that limited progress had been made with Party D on the transaction agreements. Our Board
also discussed and considered Moelis’ view that, in light of the concerns previously discussed by our Board, it was uncertain that Party D would be able
to deliver an executable transaction on the same timeline as Gray, that delaying a possible transaction with Gray to advance Party D’s various
workstreams may cause Gray to withdraw its proposal, and that our Board could evaluate, consistent with its fiduciary duties, a proposal that Party D
might submit after the Company entered into a transaction with Gray subject to certain procedures and provisions of the Merger Agreement.
Following that portion of the meeting, the Company’s advisors left the meeting and our senior management reviewed the economic value of the bids and
compared the total value to shareholders presented by each current proposal. Our Board authorized senior management and our advisors to go back to
Gray with a short list of critical deal points that would require Gray’s acceptance as a condition to moving forward and working to fully negotiate
agreements. The critical deal points included: a $50 million increase in cash consideration; confirmation that all diligence was complete; confirmation that
Gray would be in a position to sign definitive agreements within a week; and assurances that regulatory and other approvals and financing would not
delay closing. Our Board authorized representatives of Moelis to communicate to Party B that its current proposal was not competitive. Our Board
authorized senior management and our advisors to work to continue to develop Party D’s proposal, advance diligence and reverse due diligence, and
evaluate any revisions to the prior proposal that may be submitted by Party D.
Subsequent to our Board meeting, a Moelis representative spoke with Hilton Howell, the Chief Executive Officer of Gray. In that discussion, Gray agreed
to the $50 million consideration increase (for a total enterprise valuation of LMG of $2.7 billion) and accepted the other critical deal points as a condition
to moving forward.
On April 25 and 26, 2021, representatives of Cooley provided revised drafts of the transaction agreements to Eversheds to reflect the current deal terms
and input from our senior management and Board on other terms and conditions. Representatives of Cooley also provided comments on Gray’s financing
commitment papers. Over
68
Table of Contents
the course of the next week, representatives of Cooley and Eversheds continued to exchange revised drafts of the transaction agreements and had
regular calls to discuss the status of the agreements and related schedules and to negotiate the final terms of the agreements on behalf of the Company
and Gray.
On April 26, 2021, Party D submitted a revised proposal. The revised proposal continued to contemplate a Morris Trust transaction and provided for $2.66
billion cash consideration (increased from $2.56 billion, to refinance the Company’s debt and make a cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders) and a
50.2% continuing ownership interest for the Company’s shareholders in the new combined company. Party D’s price continued to include the acquisition
of the MNI business. Party D also reconfirmed its belief that the receipt of stock of NMG SpinCo in the spin-off distribution and receipt of stock of the
combined company in the merger transaction would not be taxable to the Company’s shareholders at closing. This proposal included $2.58 billion of debt
financing sources and $200 million of other unspecified financing sources, representing a total net leverage for the new combined company of 7.25x two-
year average 2019/2020 EBITDA, including the preferred financing. For the first time the proposal included a $100 million regulatory break fee payable to
the Company in the event of a regulatory failure.
On April 27, 2021, Party D’s legal advisors submitted a revised markup of the Merger Agreement to reflect a Morris Trust transaction structure. The
revised markup continued to be subject to completion of diligence and transaction structure and final financing commitments. Among other comments,
the revised markup (1) added closing conditions related to the delivery of tax opinions and the prior closing of the contribution of stations by Party E, (2)
provided that the Merger Agreement would terminate in nine months if the closing had not occurred (in contrast to the 15 months under the proposed
Gray agreement), (3) provided that the $100 million regulatory break fee would be payable by the broadcast portfolio company of Party D with limited
assets (without direct recourse to Party D or Party E), and (3) did not state a position on the amount of the break fee payable by the Company or the
reverse termination fee payable by Party D in certain events. Party D did not submit markups of the other transaction agreements and did not submit firm
financing commitments. The Company gave permission for Party D to speak to an equity financing source affiliated with Party B.
On April 28, 2021, representatives of Cooley provided a draft voting agreement to Eversheds that certain class B shareholders of the Company were
prepared to execute in response to Gray’s condition in its April 2, 2021 markups that certain shareholders of the Company agree to vote in favor of the
Merger.
Also on April 28, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley spoke further with Party D’s legal and tax advisors regarding the tax structure of the
transaction and certain elements of the tax requirements for tax-deferred treatment and tax opinions.
On April 29, 2021, Party D submitted a revised proposal. The revised proposal continued to contemplate a spin-off of the NMG business and included an
alternative to increase the cash consideration from $2.66 billion to $2.76 billion with a reduction of the ownership interest in the new combined company
for the Company’s shareholders from 50.2% to 34%. Party D’s proposal continued to include the acquisition of the MNI business. Party D reconfirmed its
belief that the receipt of stock of NMG SpinCo in the spin-off distribution and receipt of stock of the combined company in the merger transaction would
not be taxable to the Company’s shareholders at closing. The financing sources included $2.58 billion of debt and $275 million of new preferred capital,
representing a total net leverage for the new combined company of 7.27x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred
financing. The proposal indicated that Party D was having conversations with additional financing sources. The proposal included draft debt
commitment papers that were characterized as “near final” and a one-page non-binding indicative term sheet for a preferred stock investment by an
affiliate of Party B that was subject to further negotiation. On May 1, 2021, Party D submitted a letter to the Company’s senior management team and
Board advocating for Party D’s proposal. On May 1, 2021, Party D’s legal advisors communicated to representatives of Cooley that they would have
markups of the other transaction agreements soon, however, such markups were not provided before signing of the definitive agreements with Gray.

Table of Contents
On May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2021, the Company and Gray and their advisors continued to negotiate the final terms of the transaction agreements. During
this period, the parties agreed that LMG RemainCo would be allocated $1.975 billion of the Company’s net debt at closing so that the total cash payment
to shareholders in the Merger would equal $725 million (or $14.51 per share subject to adjustment based on changes to the final share count).
Later during the day on May 2, our Board also held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley
also participated. Moelis reviewed the financial aspects of the all cash proposal from Gray and the financial aspects of the current cash-stock proposal
from Party D and led a discussion with our Board through a comparison of the economic and other key aspects of the two potential transactions.
Representatives of Moelis noted that the transaction agreements with Gray were almost fully negotiated and could be executed as soon as the next day.
The Moelis representatives further noted that a potential transaction with Party D, Party E and an affiliate of Party B was not actionable on a similar
timeline as a transaction with Gray, and was subject to completing confirmatory diligence and reverse diligence by the Company, subject to receiving firm
financing commitments and subject to negotiating final transaction agreements. Representatives of Moelis provided their perspectives on potential
market reaction to the new combined company under Party D’s proposal. Our Board expressed the importance of certainty of value, the regulatory
considerations, the closing path and expected timing. Our Board asked questions about the certainty of closing and timing of closing under the two
potential deals and how much more time it would take to negotiate a deal with Party D and Party E and the risk of losing the Gray deal. Representatives of
Cooley reviewed the regulatory considerations for both potential transactions, including the greater complexity and materially higher risk of opposition,
scrutiny and delay for the transaction involving Party D and Party E. Our senior management and advisors reviewed with our Board the fact that the Gray
Merger Agreement included a break fee payable by the Company of only $36 million and would not preclude Party D from submitting an unsolicited
proposal after signing a deal with Gray, and subject to certain procedures and provisions of the Merger Agreement would allow our Board to consider a
new proposal consistent with its fiduciary duties.
Representatives of Cooley reviewed again our Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of considering the proposed separation, spin-off and sale
transactions. Representatives of Cooley also reviewed the material terms and conditions of the transaction agreements negotiated with Gray, including (1)
the structure of the separation, spin-off and merger transactions, (2) the allocation of assets and liabilities between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo, (3)
the tax treatment of the transactions to the Company and shareholders, (4) NMG SpinCo’s capitalization, (5) the treatment of the Company’s employees
and their equity awards, (6) the financing transaction commitments, (6) the closing conditions to consummating the spin-off and merger, (7) the
Company’s rights and obligations in connection with considering unsolicited alternative proposals received after signing, including the Board’s rights to
change its recommendation and terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal subject to payment of a $36 million break fee, and (8) the
termination provisions that bound Gray to seek to consummate the transaction for up to 15 months and required Gray to pay a $125 million reverse
termination fee if Gray failed to close the transaction in breach of the agreements. Our Board asked questions and discussed the proposed Gray
transaction and related risks. Our senior management reviewed with our Board the key terms of NMG SpinCo’s financing commitment. Representatives of
Moelis reviewed with our Board its financial analysis of the merger consideration in connection with its fairness analysis of the Gray transaction. Prior to
the meeting, representatives of Moelis had provided certain information regarding Moelis’ material investment banking relationships with Gray and other
counterparties during the prior two-year period, and our Board determined that Moelis did not have any disqualifying conflicts of interest in serving as
financial advisor to the Company and providing a fairness opinion in connection with any potential transaction with Gray.
Following these board meetings, the Company and Gray continued to negotiate to finalize the transaction agreements and related schedules.
During the early morning of May 3, 2021, members of our senior management and representatives of Cooley spoke with members of Gray’s senior
management and representatives of Eversheds to discuss and
70
Table of Contents
resolve the final open issues under the transaction agreements. Later that morning before market open, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of
our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated and confirmed that the transaction agreements with Gray were fully
negotiated with no material changes to the terms reviewed with our Board on the previous day. Representatives of Moelis confirmed that the final cash
merger consideration was $14.51 per share based on the final share count as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Representatives of Moelis reviewed its
final financial analysis of the merger consideration and rendered to our Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion, dated as of May 3, 2021, that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, the merger consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to be received by the holders of the
Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock (other than the Excluded Holders) in the Merger (as contemplated by the Merger Agreement
executed on May 3, 2021) was fair from a financial point of view to such holders (other than the Excluded Holders). For a more detailed discussion of
Moelis’ opinion, please see below under the caption “The Merger—Opinion of Meredith’s Financial Advisor.” The opinion of Moelis is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex B. Based on our Board’s consideration of the factors in favor of and against the proposed transaction with Gray, including
various factors that our Board had considered and weighed throughout the process, including the factors described in “The Merger—Reasons for the
Merger,” our Board unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement (as executed on May 3, 2021) and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, are advisable, (b) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on the Company’s
shareholders as well as the effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c) approved the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, and (d) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby the Merger.
Also early on the morning of May 3, Gray’s board of directors met and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transaction agreements and transactions.
Following our and Gray’s Board meetings, the definitive Merger Agreement was executed by authorized officers of the Company, Gray and Merger Sub.
The definitive Separation and Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement were
also executed by authorized officers of the Company, NMG SpinCo and Gray. The definitive Voting Agreement was executed by authorized officers of
Gray and the shareholders of the Company party thereto.
Immediately prior to public announcement, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to communicate that the Company would be
announcing a transaction with another party and that the Company would be required to terminate discussions with all other parties subject to the terms
of the definitive Merger Agreement.
Execution of the Merger Agreement and other transaction agreements was publicly announced on the morning of May 3, 2021 before market open.
On May 13, 2021, Party D sent a letter addressed to our senior management and our Board making an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire LMG
RemainCo. The letter proposed $2.76 billion of cash consideration ($2.724 billion after payment of the $36 million break fee payable to Gray under the
Merger Agreement) and reduced the ownership interest of the Company’s shareholders in the new combined company compared to Party D’s April 29,
2021 proposal from 34% to 19%. The proposal implied a $750 million cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders (based on the $1.975 billion closing net
debt target agreed to with Gray), or $14.99 per share (reduced from $15.71 per share in Party D’s April 29, 2021 proposal). Under this new proposal, the
Company’s MNI business would be retained by NMG SpinCo as in the Gray transaction. Party D now planned to acquire three additional stations from
Party E to replace the MNI cash flow. The financing
71
Table of Contents
sources included $2.58 billion of debt and $300 million of new preferred capital (including warrants for 12.5% of the fully diluted equity), representing a
net leverage ratio of 7.33x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred financing. The proposal included a signed
debt commitment letter that expired nine months after signing (in contrast to the 15 months under the Gray transaction). The preferred financing
commitment from an affiliate of Party B was unsigned, in draft form and contingent upon further diligence. The proposal also contemplated a $75 million
cash investment by Party D. The equity commitment letter was unsigned and in draft form. Party D also submitted markups of the definitive transaction
agreements executed by the Company and Gray. Party D accepted the form and substance of the Gray agreements in principle, adjusted for transaction
and tax structure. Party D reconfirmed its belief that the receipt of NMG SpinCo shares in the spin-off distribution and receipt of shares in the new
combined company in the merger transaction would not be taxable to the Company’s shareholders at closing.
On May 14, 2021, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to acknowledge receipt of the proposal and explain the review process in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The principal of Party D indicated verbally that Party D was also working on an alternative structure
that would include additional stations, reduce the preferred financing, and enable Party D to further increase the amount of the cash dividend to the
Company’s shareholders.
On May 14, 2021, the Company and Gray submitted regulatory filings to the FCC and DOJ for approval of the transaction.
On May 16, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.
Representatives of Moelis updated our Board regarding the call with Party D. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed the terms of Party D’s
proposal, and representatives of Cooley discussed certain legal matters relating to the Board’s fiduciary duties and the Company’s obligations under the
Merger Agreement with respect to receiving and considering the unsolicited proposal, including the contractual and fiduciary determination our Board
would be required to make in order to permit the Company to negotiate the proposal with Party D consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
During the discussion, representatives of Moelis provided its views on the proposed financing structure and terms and valuation considerations of the
new combined company.
Our senior management discussed the tax treatment of the proposed transaction to the Company and shareholders as compared to the Gray transaction.
They discussed the potential value of the tax deferral on the value of the NMG SpinCo shares as compared to the potential value of obtaining a stepped
up tax basis in the shares at closing in the context of possible changes to prevailing tax rates and the payment of future dividends by NMG SpinCo. Our
advisors noted that additional information and analysis would be required to reach a definitive conclusion on the tax treatment of the Party D transaction
and associated tax opinions.
Our regulatory advisors presented their perspectives on the regulatory considerations. Our regulatory advisors noted that the Company and Gray had
submitted their regulatory filings to the FCC and DOJ and believed there was a high probability that the Gray transaction would receive all regulatory
approvals by early December of 2021. Our regulatory advisors continued to believe that, relative to the Gray transaction, the regulatory profile of the
transaction involving Party D and Party E involved greater regulatory complexity and presented materially higher risk of regulatory opposition, scrutiny
and delay, which increased the risk of closing in 2022 for all the reasons previously discussed with our Board. Our regulatory advisors noted that more
information and analysis would be required to confirm that the proposed preferred stock investment by an affiliate of Party B would not raise additional
regulatory issues. Our senior management and advisors provided their perspective that the proposed regulatory break fee of $100 million would not
adequately compensate the Company for a failed transaction and that the break fee was only recourse to the broadcast portfolio company of Party D with
limited assets, so that the break fee as currently structured may not provide the desired incentives for Party D and Party E to resolve any potential
regulatory issues.

Our senior management and advisors discussed potential responses and next steps with our Board. Our Board instructed our advisors to notify Gray of
the proposal in accordance with the Company’s obligations under the Merger Agreement. After discussion, our Board decided to meet again later in the
week to consider the Party D proposal further after our advisors sought clarification regarding certain aspects of the proposal in accordance with the
Merger Agreement and after Gray was notified of the proposal.
On May 17, 2021, a Moelis representative spoke to Mr. Howell, the Chief Executive Officer of Gray, to inform him of Party D’s proposal. Later that day, at
the direction of the Company, representatives of Moelis provided a written summary of the material terms of the proposal to Mr. Howell in accordance
with the Merger Agreement. Representatives of Cooley also provided the written summary to representatives of Eversheds. Later that day,
representatives of Cooley spoke with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day, legal advisors to Gray (“Jones Day”). The representatives of
Eversheds and Jones Day asked questions about the structure and certain other elements of the proposal. After discussion, representatives of Cooley
invited them to submit a list of follow-up questions that may facilitate Gray’s evaluation of the proposal. Representatives of Cooley also informed them
that the Company was planning to convene a Board meeting on May 21, 2021 to consider the proposal further.
On May 18, 2021, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to provide an update on the status of the Company’s review of the proposal.
On May 19, 2021, representatives of Cooley spoke again with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day regarding the proposal. Subsequent to the
call, representatives of Eversheds submitted a list of follow-up questions regarding the Party D proposal. Also on this day, at the direction of the
Company, representatives of Moelis submitted a list of questions to Party D to clarify certain aspects of the proposal as permitted by the Merger
Agreement. Representatives of Moelis also spoke with representatives of Wells Fargo, financial advisors to Gray, regarding the status of the Company’s
review of Party D’s proposal.
On May 20, 2021, representatives of Moelis, Cooley and Deloitte spoke with members of Party D senior management and representatives of Party D’s
legal advisors, who provided responses to the clarifying questions submitted on the previous day.
On May 21, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.
Representatives of Moelis reviewed with the Board the interactions with Party D and Gray since receipt of Party D’s proposal on May 13, 2021.
Representatives of Moelis also reviewed the status of Party D’s proposal based on Party D’s responses to the clarifying questions. Representatives of
Cooley led a discussion of fiduciary and legal considerations relating to consideration of the proposal, and representatives of Moelis led a discussion of
potential enhancements that could make the proposal more attractive to the Company, and potential responses and next steps. Our Board deliberated on
whether the proposal under the terms of the Merger Agreement “is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal” in light of
the current status and terms of the proposal and Party D’s verbal indications that it was working on an alternative structure that would enable Party D to
enhance its proposal further. After discussion, our Board determined to meet again to deliberate further on the proposal and consider any revised
proposals that may be forthcoming from either party. Our Board instructed representatives of Moelis to communicate with Party D and Gray regarding the
status of our Board’s deliberations.
Later that day, a Moelis representative spoke to Mr. Howell and a representative of Wells Fargo to update them on the status of our Board’s deliberations.
Representatives of Cooley also spoke with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day to provide them an update. A Moelis representative also
communicated to the principal of Party D that our Board had met but no formal conclusions were made. The Party D principal communicated that a
possible submission of an enhanced proposal could be forthcoming in the coming week.
On May 22, 2021, representatives of Cooley provided to Eversheds and Jones Day additional information regarding Party D’s proposal in response to the
questions previously submitted by representatives of Eversheds.

On May 25, 2021, Mr. Howell communicated to a representative of Moelis that a revised proposal would be forthcoming from Gray. Later that day, Gray
sent a letter addressed to our Board proposing to increase the cash merger payment to the Company’s shareholders to $15.25 per share (an increase from
$14.51 per share and representing an aggregate enterprise value increase of $37 million to $2.737 billion). In exchange for the price increase, Gray
proposed to increase the termination fee payable by the Company under specified circumstances under the Merger Agreement from $36 million to $73
million and added a so-called “force the vote” provision that would require the Company to submit the Gray transaction to a shareholder vote even if our
Board changed its recommendation in response to a superior proposal. The letter noted Gray’s belief that its deal was “far superior” to the Party D
proposal and highlighted the progress the parties had made toward closing, the clearer regulatory path, and the progress Gray was making on the Flint-
Saginaw-Bay City divestiture. Gray’s letter indicated that the offer would expire on June 1, 2021.
Later that day, a representative of Wells Fargo spoke with a representative of Moelis regarding the proposal. Representatives of Eversheds and Jones
Day also spoke with representatives of Cooley to provide additional background on the terms of Gray’s proposal. Representatives of Eversheds also
confirmed that the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City divestiture process had advanced to the second round with fully qualified bidders and that Gray expected the
divestiture agreement could be signed and filed with the FCC during the month of June 2021.
Later that day, our senior management spoke with representatives of Moelis and Cooley regarding the Gray proposal.
On the evening of May 26, 2021, Party D sent a letter addressed to our senior management and our Board with a revised unsolicited, non-binding
proposal to acquire LMG RemainCo. Compared to the prior proposal, the revised proposal increased the cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders by
$76 million (after payment of the $36 million break fee that would be due Gray) and reduced the ownership interest of the Company’s shareholders in the
new combined company from 19% to 10%. The revised proposal implied an $825 million aggregate cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders (based
on the $1.975 billion closing net debt target agreed to with Gray), or $16.51 per share. The revised proposal contemplated the contribution of four
television stations from Party B in exchange for common stock warrants. The letter stated that the contribution of the Party B stations would unlock
additional retransmission revenue synergies and provide additional cash flow. The financing sources included $2.863 billion of debt and $136 million of
new preferred capital, representing a net leverage ratio of 6.5x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including the preferred financing.
The proposal included a signed debt commitment letter (delivered the next day), which expired after nine months (in contrast to the 15 months under the
Gray transaction). Under the revised proposal, the preferred financing would be provided by Party D rather than an affiliate of Party B. The proposal did
not include an updated commitment letter for the preferred financing. Party D reconfirmed its belief that the receipt of NMG SpinCo shares in the spin-off
distribution and receipt of shares in the new combined company in the merger transaction would not be taxable to the Company’s shareholders at closing.
On May 27, 2021, representatives of Moelis and Cooley reviewed Party D’s revised proposal with our senior management. Later that day, a Moelis
representative spoke with Mr. Howell to inform him of Party D’s revised proposal and inform him that our Board was inclined to view Party D’s revised
proposal as one that “could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal”. Mr. Howell indicated that Gray had flexibility to improve its
proposal and was prepared to negotiate a potential amendment to the transaction agreements over the holiday weekend. After the call, at the instruction
of the Company and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Moelis representative shared a written summary of the material terms of Party D’s
new proposal with Mr. Howell. Representatives of Cooley also provided the summary to representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day. A principal of Party
D also contacted a representative of Moelis, who reported to the principal that our Board was scheduled to meet the next day.
Later on May 27, 2021, Party D provided the updated executed debt commitment letter for the increased debt financing.

On May 28, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.
Moelis led a discussion comparing the financial aspects of Gray’s May 25, 2021 proposal and Party D’s revised May 26, 2021 proposal. With respect to
the Gray proposal, our legal advisors provided their perspective that the “force the vote” provision was problematic because it could unreasonably chill a
competitive bidding process but that an increase in the break fee amount could be considered in the context of a price increase and did not consider $73
million unreasonable as a percentage of overall transaction value.
With respect to Party D’s revised proposal, representatives of Moelis provided its views on the proposed financing structure and terms and valuation
considerations of the new combined company. The Moelis representatives discussed the impact of potential retransmission revenue synergies in
connection with the contribution of the Party B stations but noted that the Company would need to confirm the terms of the retransmission revenue
agreements and the amount of synergies. The Moelis representatives noted that, giving full credit for the indicated retransmission revenue synergies, the
new combined company would be leveraged at 6.5x two-year average 2019/2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA under the revised proposal (as compared to
7.3x under the previous proposal). Our senior management and advisors continued to be of the view that the additional complexity of the Party D
proposal would require at least two weeks to fully negotiate and presented a materially higher risk of closing delay, which increased the risk of closing in
2022.
Our senior management and advisors discussed with our Board potential responses and next steps. After discussion, our Board authorized our senior
management and advisors to attempt to negotiate an acceptable amendment with Gray, which would need to include a cash price higher than Party D’s
revised proposal and could include a break fee in the 2.5-3.0% of transaction value range but no “force the vote” provision. Our Board was of the view
that the Company could also seek a waiver from Gray under the Merger Agreement to permit the Company to negotiate with Party D prior to making a
finding that Party D’s revised proposal “is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal”.
Later that day, May 28, a Moelis representative spoke with Mr. Howell and discussed the terms of a potential amendment. At the direction of the
Company, the Moelis representative communicated that the Company would accept the $73 million break fee if Gray increased enterprise value to $2.825
billion (or $16.99 per share) and would accept the 5 business day “match right” period, but that the Company would not accept the “force the vote”
provision. The Moelis representatives provided a written summary of the Company’s proposal to Gray after the call.
Later that day, Gray provided a written response. Gray offered to increase the enterprise value to $2.825 billion ($16.99 per share) but continued to insist
on the “force the vote” provision and added two new provisions: an option to purchase three stations at an economic discount that would be exercisable
by Gray if our Board changed its recommendation or terminated the transaction to accept a superior proposal, and a termination fee of $73 million payable
by the Company in the event the closing did not occur due to a failure to consummate the NMG SpinCo financing.
On the morning of May 29, 2021, our senior management reviewed Gray’s response with representatives of Moelis and Cooley. After discussion, our
senior management was prepared to recommend to our Board that it accept the $73 million termination fee and offer to increase the break fee to $85 million
if Gray would agree to $2.825 billion enterprise value without the “force the vote” provision and without the station purchase option. Our senior
management and advisors continued to be of the view that the “force the vote” provision was problematic and believed that the station option would
chill a competitive bidding process, was too dilutive of value, created tax leakage and operated as an additional termination fee. Our senior management
instructed representatives of Cooley to communicate this to Gray’s legal advisors.
Later that morning, representatives of Cooley spoke with representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day and communicated the current views of our senior
management. Representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day
75
Table of Contents
explained that the termination fee was intended to further align the parties’ incentives to consummate their respective financings and provide greater
certainty of closing for both parties.
On May 29, 2021, representatives from Moelis and Cooley drafted a new list of clarifying questions with respect to Party D’s proposal.
On May 31, 2021, Gray provided its response in writing. In its response, Gray accepted the $85 million break fee and $73 million termination fee and
withdrew the “force the vote” provision. However, Gray retained the station purchase option and reduced its offer to $2.803 enterprise value ($16.55 per
share in cash). Members of our senior management subsequently reviewed the response with representatives of Moelis and Cooley. After discussion,
our senior management determined that Gray would either need to accept the Company’s last offer or senior management would recommend to our Board
that it consider how to move forward with Party D. Our senior management instructed representatives of Moelis to speak with Mr. Howell.
A Moelis representative reached out to Mr. Howell. A representative of Wells Fargo returned the call and communicated that Gray would only move
forward at a $2.825 billion enterprise value ($16.99 per share in cash) if the Company agreed to either the “force the vote” provision or the station
purchase option. Subsequently, a Moelis representative spoke with Mr. Howell regarding the parties’ respective positions and the implications of not
reaching agreement. Mr. Howell asked if the Company would have flexibility to consider increasing the break fee to $125 million if Gray agreed to a $2.825
billion enterprise value ($16.99 per share in cash) without the “force the vote” provision or station purchase option. The Moelis representative agreed to
discuss Mr. Howell’s proposal with the Company.
Later that day, May 31, our senior management spoke to representatives of Moelis and Cooley regarding Mr. Howell’s proposal. They discussed the legal
considerations applicable to break fees and discussed the benefits and risks of obtaining a higher price in exchange for a higher break fee and of not
reaching agreement with Gray. After discussion, our senior management determined that it was prepared to recommend to our Board that it accept a $113
million break fee (or 4% of transaction value) in exchange for a $2.825 billion enterprise value ($16.99 per share in cash).
Later that evening, a Moelis representative and Mr. Harty, our Chief Executive Officer, separately spoke with Mr. Howell. Messrs. Harty and Howell
agreed that they were both prepared to recommend to their respective Boards an amendment that provided for a $2.825 billion enterprise value ($16.99 per
share) in exchange for a $113 million break fee payable by the Company and a $73 million termination payable by the Company in the event that the
Closing did not occur due to a failure to consummate the NMG SpinCo financing.
On June 1, 2021, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management and representatives of Moelis and Cooley also participated.
Representatives of Moelis updated our Board on the discussions between the Company and Gray since the previous Board meeting and described the
terms of the proposed amendment with Gray. Representatives of Moelis and Cooley discussed the considerations and rationales for the increased break
fee and the termination fee and why, in their view, it was preferable to agree to an increased break fee rather than a “force the vote” provision or station
purchase option. Representatives of Moelis also led a discussion to compare the terms of the proposed amendment with Gray to the terms of Party D’s
latest revised proposal of May 26, 2021. After considering both proposals and fully assessing the benefits and risks of each, including certainty of value,
regulatory considerations, path to closing and expected timing, our Board communicated its support for the proposed amendment to the Merger
Agreement. Based on our Board’s consideration of the factors in favor of and against the proposed amendment with Gray, including various factors that
our Board had considered and weighed throughout the process, including the factors described in “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger,” our Board
unanimously (a) determined that the amended Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, (b)
determined that the amended Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, taken together, are at a price and on
terms that are fair to, and in the best interest of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on the
76
Table of Contents
Company’s shareholders as well as the effect on certain of the other community interests set forth in Section 490.1108A of the IBCA, (c) approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the amended Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, and (d) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of the amended Merger
Agreement and thereby the Merger.
After our Board meeting, Mr. Harty spoke to Mr. Howell and informed him that our Board had unanimously approved the proposed amendment.
Subsequently, over the course of the day, representatives of Cooley and representatives of Eversheds and Jones Day worked to finalize the formal
amendment to the Merger Agreement and a related amendment to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
On June 2, 2021, Gray’s board of directors met and unanimously approved the proposed amendment to the Merger Agreement and authorized
management and the advisers to finalize the terms of the amendment and the related financing commitments. Later that day, after market close, the parties
executed the amendment to the Merger Agreement and the amendment to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Gray delivered updated
executed financing commitments. Subsequently, a Moelis representative spoke with a principal of Party D to communicate that the Company would be
announcing the execution of the amendment with Gray.
The Company and Gray publicly announced their agreement on the Merger Agreement amendment early in the morning of June 3, 2021 before market
open.
As described elsewhere in this proxy statement, on October 6, 2021, the Company and NMG SpinCo entered into the Dotdash Merger Agreement. Gray’s
consent was required for the Company to enter into the Dotdash Merger Agreement. Accordingly, on October 6, 2021, concurrently with entering into the
Dotdash Merger Agreement, the Company and Dotdash entered into the Consent Agreement with Gray. The Dotdash Merger and Consent Agreement
do not alter the recommendation of our Board that the shareholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, as amended.
Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

At a meeting of the Board held on May 3, 2021 to evaluate and approve the Merger, Moelis rendered its oral opinion to the Board, confirmed by the
delivery of a written opinion dated May 3, 2021, addressed to the Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, the consideration of $14.51 per share in cash to

financial point of view, to such holders. For purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “consideration” or “Merger
consideration” refers to the consideration of $14.51 per share in cash that would have been paid pursuant to the Original Agreement. (Subsequent to the

consideration was increased to $16.99 per share in cash.)
The full text of Moelis’ written opinion dated May 3, 2021, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and

to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger consideration or otherwise. Moelis’ opinion was approved by a Moelis fairness
opinion committee.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Moelis to the Board at a meeting held on May 3, 2021, in connection with its
opinion. Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Moelis’
analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses.
Considering the data described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Moelis’ analyses.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, stock prices are based on closing stock prices on April 30, 2021. For purposes of, among other things, deriving
per share implied equity values for the Company, Moelis calculated certain per share amounts for the Company based on estimated diluted shares
outstanding on the estimated closing date as of April 30, 2021 pursuant to the Original Agreement.
For purposes of its analyses, Moelis reviewed a number of financial metrics, including the following:
Adjusted LMG EBITDA: generally calculated as the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to
include the impact of stock-based compensation expense and to exclude one-time charges and benefits and to reflect the full-year impact of material
corporate transactions. Adjusted LMG EBITDA estimates for the Company assumed the spinoff of the Company’s NMG business segment had already
occurred.
79
Table of Contents
Broadcast Cash Flow (“BCF”): Calculated as the relevant company’s Adjusted LMG EBITDA plus corporate expense.
Enterprise Value (or “EV”): which was calculated as the market value of the relevant company’s fully diluted common equity based on its closing stock
price as of April 30, 2021 (i) plus preferred stock, (ii) plus debt, (iii) less cash and cash equivalents, (iv) less unconsolidated assets (v) plus book value of
non-controlling interests and (vi) plus after-tax underfunded pension obligation (in each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), as of the relevant
company’s most recently reported quarter end). The Company’s EV was calculated assuming the spinoff of NMG was completed and that the Company
has net debt equal to the Target Net Debt Amount as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement of $1,975,000,000.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, (i) the estimates of the future financial performance for the selected companies listed below were based on certain
publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies, and (ii) the estimates of the future financial performance of the Company relied upon
for the financial analyses described below were based on the Financial Forecasts.
Moelis’ analyses were pro forma for the spinoff of NMG and reflected valuation for the Company’s remaining broadcast television station business
following completion of the spinoff.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Moelis performed a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis of the Company (pro forma for the NMG spinoff) using the Financial Forecasts and other
information and data provided by the Company’s management to calculate an estimate of the present value of the estimated future unlevered after-tax free
cash flows projected to be generated by the Company and an estimate of the present value of the Company’s estimated terminal value, taking into
account the present value of the Company’s cash tax rate of 30% during the projection period, as instructed by the Company’s management. For
purposes of the DCF analysis, Moelis calculated unlevered free cash flow as Adjusted LMG EBITDA, then less (i) taxes, (ii) cash payments for Broadcast
Rights, (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) changes in net working capital.
In performing the DCF analysis, Moelis utilized a range of discount rates of 6.00% to 8.00% based on an estimated range of the Company’s weighted
average cost of capital (the “WACC”). The estimated WACC range reflected a cost of equity derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model using (i) a
risk-free rate based on 20-year U.S. government bonds, (ii) a selected range of unlevered betas and debt to total capitalization ratios informed by the
selected publicly traded companies described below, (iii) an equity risk premium and (iv) a size premium. Moelis applied this range to the Company’s
estimated two-year average of the CY2024 and CY2025 Adjusted LMG EBITDA, as further adjusted to set depreciation and amortization equal to capital
expenditures. The foregoing range of discount rates was used to calculate (i) the estimated present values as of December 31, 2021 of the Company’s
estimated after-tax unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2021 through 2025 using the mid-year convention and (ii) a range of estimated terminal
values (based on the current and historical trading multiples for the publicly traded Pure-Play TV broadcasting companies described below) of 7.75x to
9.25x.
Based on the foregoing, Moelis derived implied per share reference ranges for the Company of $8.76 to $19.34. Moelis compared the implied per share
reference ranges to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Moelis reviewed financial information for nine transactions announced since 2017 involving companies in the television broadcasting industry with an
Enterprise Value of at least approximately $500 million because those transactions primarily consisted of whole company transactions or station portfolio
transactions of comparable size. Moelis reviewed, among other things, transaction values of the selected precedent transactions as a multiple, to the
extent information was publicly available, of two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA of the target company. Of the nine transactions evaluated, seven
of the transactions had estimates of two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA of the target company available. Financial data for the relevant
transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. The selected precedent transactions
used in this analysis and their implied transaction value to two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA multiples are summarized below:

Based on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment, Moelis selected a multiple range of 8.5x to 10.5x two-year average Adjusted LMG
EBITDA. Moelis then applied such multiple range to the average of the Company’s actual Adjusted LMG EBITDA for calendar year 2020 and estimated
Adjusted LMG EBITDA for calendar year 2021 provided by the Company’s management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for
the Company of $5.95 to $16.66 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share reference range to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share. In
selecting its range, Moelis referenced the median of the data set (9.5x two-year average Adjusted LMG EBITDA).

Company’s management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for the Company of $14.22 to $20.19 per share. Moelis compared the
implied per share reference range to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share.
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis
Moelis reviewed financial and stock market information of the selected publicly traded companies noted below that are in the television broadcasting
business, listed on a major U.S. exchange and deemed relevant by Moelis in certain respects to the Company.
Financial data for the selected companies were based on publicly available median consensus research analysts’ estimates and public filings. In the case
of projected Adjusted LMG EBITDA for the Company, Moelis reviewed the Financial Forecasts.

Based on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected a multiple range of 7.0x to 8.5x average Adjusted LMG
EBITDA for calendar year 2020 (actual) to calendar year 2021 (estimated). Moelis’ range was informed by the Pure-Play Broadcasters given comparable
operating and growth profiles to the Company. Moelis excluded TEGNA, Inc. from its multiple range because of the impact to TEGNA, Inc’s trading levels
from ongoing merger speculation. Moelis then applied its multiple range to the Company’s average Adjusted LMG EBITDA for calendar year 2020 to
calendar year 2021, provided by the Company’s management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for the Company of $0.00 to
$5.95 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share reference range to the Merger consideration of $14.51 per share.

Miscellaneous
The foregoing is a summary of the analyses undertaken by Moelis in connection with Moelis’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth
above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Moelis’ opinion. In arriving at its
fairness determination, Moelis considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather,
Moelis made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No
company or transaction used in the analyses described above is identical to the Company or the Merger. In addition, such analyses do not purport to be
appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future
results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.
Because the analyses described above are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, neither the Company nor Moelis or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those forecast.
The Merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and the Acquiror and was approved by the Board.
Moelis did not recommend any specific consideration to the Company or the Board, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the
only appropriate consideration for the transaction. Moelis acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee
for its services, currently estimated to be approximately $33.6 million in the aggregate, $2.5 of which was earned in connection with the delivery of Moelis’
opinion dated May 3, 2021, in connection with the Board’s consideration of the proposed Merger, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, and the
remainder of which is contingent upon completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the Company has agreed to indemnify Moelis for certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.
The Board retained Moelis based upon Moelis’s qualifications, experience, and expertise. Moelis’ affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any
time own securities (long or short) of the Company and Gray. Moelis may, in the future, provide investment banking or other services to the Company,
Gray, or other parties involved in the Merger and may receive compensation for such services. In the two years prior to the date hereof, Moelis acted as
financial advisor to the Company in connection with a divestiture and earned fees of approximately $2.5 million in connection with such assignment.
Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by Meredith in Connection with the Merger",85,91
MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by Meredith in Connection with the Merger,"Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by Meredith in Connection with the Merger
Other than quarterly and annual financial guidance provided to investors, which the Company may update from time to time, the Company does not, as a
matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other financial results due to, among other reasons, the
unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Board’s review of strategic and financial alternatives and
evaluation of the Merger and the Spin-Off, the Company’s management prepared certain forward-looking financial information with respect to LMG (after
giving effect to the Spin-Off) for calendar years 2021 through 2025 (the “Financial Forecasts”) that were made available to the Company’s financial
advisors. The Company has included below a summary of these forecasts for the purpose of providing shareholders and investors access to certain non-
public information that was furnished to third parties, and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The inclusion of this information
should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company, Moelis, their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information
considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should
not be relied on as such.
The Financial Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published
guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American
83Table of Contents
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”). In addition, the Financial Forecasts were not prepared with the assistance of or audited, reviewed, compiled or examined by independent
accountants. The summary of the Financial Forecasts is not being included in this proxy statement to influence any shareholder’s decision whether to
support the Merger, but rather because the Financial Forecasts were made available by the Company to the Board and were used by Moelis in connection
with the rendering of its fairness opinion to the Board and performing its related financial analyses, as described under “Opinion of Meredith’s Financial
Advisor” in this proxy statement. The Financial Forecasts may differ from publicly available analyst estimates and forecasts and does not take into
account any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and the Spin-Off.
The Financial Forecasts are subjective in many respects and were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may
be beyond the control of the Company’s management. Because the Financial Forecasts cover multiple years, they become subject to greater uncertainty
with each successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in such forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to:
significant competition across the media landscape, including from other broadcasters, cable and satellite companies and digital content providers, social
media platforms, search platforms, portals and marketing services, among others; exposure to risks associated with the current challenging conditions in
the broadcast industry; the risk of failure to develop or acquire technologies that adequately serve changing consumer behaviors and support the
Company’s evolving business needs; and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2021, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8- K. In addition, the Financial Forecasts do not reflect any events that
could affect the Company’s prospects, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred since, or
that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the Financial Forecasts were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and the Spin-
Off. The assumptions upon which the Financial Forecasts were based necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future
economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of
which are beyond the Company’s control. The Financial Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the forecasts contained in the Financial Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from
those shown. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or its affiliates,
officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or consider the Financial Forecasts necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the
Financial Forecasts should not be relied upon as such. None of the Company or its respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives can give any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Financial Forecasts, and the Company undertakes no obligation to
update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing or arising after the date such Financial Forecasts were
generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Financial Forecasts are shown
to be in error. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives intend to make publicly available any update or
other revisions to the Financial Forecasts. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives have made or make
any representation to any shareholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the
Financial Forecasts or that forecasted results will be achieved. The Company has made no representation to Gray or Merger Sub, in the Merger
Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Financial Forecasts.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in these forecasts, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any,
reliance on these forecasts.

Adjusted LMG EBITDA is defined as Company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to include the impact of
stock-based compensation expense and to exclude one-time charges and benefits and to reflect the full-year impact of material corporate
transactions. Adjusted LMG EBITDA estimates for the Company assumed the Spin-Off had already occurred.

Our Board has unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable,
fair to, and in the best interest of, Meredith and its shareholders, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance by Meredith of the Merger
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and (c) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of
Meredith approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger.
Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of (a) a majority of the votes cast by holders of the outstanding shares of

In considering the unanimous recommendation of our Board in favor of the Merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may
have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of shareholders generally. Our Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Shareholders should take these benefits into account in
deciding whether to vote for adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger. As described in more detail below, these interests
include:
•
continued employment with NMG SpinCo or with Gray, as applicable;
•
cash out of certain equity awards;
•
receipt of new NMG SpinCo equity awards and retention awards; and
•
eligibility to receive severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations.
For further information with respect to the arrangements between Meredith and its executive officers, directors and affiliates described in this Item, as well
as other arrangements between Meredith and its executive officers, directors, and affiliates, please see our Definitive Proxy Statement filed pursuant to
Regulation 14A on September 25, 2020.
85Table of Contents
Allocation of Directors and Executive Officers Between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo Following the Spin-Off
Under the Employee Matters Agreement, as part of the Separation, the executive officers of Meredith (other than Patrick McCreery), are allocated to NMG
SpinCo, and NMG SpinCo is obligated to assume all employment agreements, individual supplemental benefit agreements and other individual
agreements entered into between Meredith and the executive officers (other than Patrick McCreery) prior to the Distribution. Thomas Harty, the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company, will be the Chief Executive Officer of NMG SpinCo. Except with regard to certain equity awards that will be cashed out
in connection with the Merger (as described more fully below under “Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Cash-Out of
Certain Meredith Equity Awards”), NMG SpinCo is obligated to assume responsibility for, pay and be liable for, all wages, salaries, welfare, incentive
compensation and employment-related liabilities, and all compensation and employment-related plans and agreements, with respect to each of the
directors and executive officers (other than Patrick McCreery).
Under the Employee Matters Agreement, as part of the Separation, Mr. McCreery is allocated to LMG RemainCo, and LMG RemainCo is obligated to
retain and assume all employment agreements, individual supplemental benefit agreements and other individual agreements entered into between
Meredith and Mr. McCreery prior to the Distribution. Certain equity awards held by Mr. McCreery will be cashed out in connection with the Merger (as
described more fully below under “Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Cash-Out of Certain Meredith Equity Awards”). Mr.
McCreery may also be entitled to certain payments upon termination due to a change in control (as described more fully below under “Interests of Our
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Change in Control Severance Agreement” and “Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—“Golden Parachute” Compensation”). Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement,
all payment obligations of Meredith to Mr. McCreery are retained by LMG RemainCo and not assumed by NMG SpinCo.
Treatment of Equity Awards
The equity holdings of Meredith’s directors and executive officers will generally be treated in the same manner as the equity holdings of all other equity
holders.
Upon the completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), restricted stock award, restricted stock
unit (“RSU”) and other Share-Based Award granted under Meredith’s equity plans will be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Gray an
amount of cash equal to $16.99 per share (or in the case of stock options, the excess, if any, of $16.99 over the exercise price of such option, as adjusted in
connection with the Spin-Off as described below), without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding.
Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, each outstanding stock option granted under Meredith’s equity plans will be
converted into two options: (1) an adjusted Company stock option that will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in the
Merger as described above, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares. The number of shares subject to the adjusted Company stock option and the
NMG SpinCo stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Company stock option prior to the Spin-Off, but the exercise prices
will be adjusted to reflect the relative values of LMG RemainCo and NMG SpinCo. The NMG SpinCo stock options will generally be subject to the same
terms and conditions as set forth in the related Company stock option award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo stock options
held by employees of LMG RemainCo (including Mr. McCreery) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG
SpinCo as described below.
Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of restricted stock awards, RSUs and Share-Based Awards granted under
Meredith’s equity plans will receive restricted stock awards, RSUs and
86
Table of Contents
Share-Based Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares subject to the related Company award prior to the Spin-Off. The NMG
SpinCo restricted stock awards, RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related
Company award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG RemainCo (including Mr. McCreery) will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo as described below.
To the extent that Meredith issues additional equity awards to its directors and executive officers after the date of this proxy statement but prior to the
completion of the Spin-Off (or, in the case of Mr. McCreery, prior to the completion of the Merger), we anticipate that any such additional equity awards
will be treated in the Spin-Off and the Merger in a manner consistent with the existing equity awards held by Meredith’s directors and executive officers,
as described above.
See “Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Cash-Out of Certain Meredith Equity Awards” below for further detail.
Outstanding Shares Held by Executive Officers and Directors
As of September 30, 2021, the executive officers and directors of Meredith owned, in the aggregate, 245,023 shares of Meredith Common Stock (which, for
clarity, excludes shares of Meredith Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Meredith stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards,
RSUs and other Share-Based Awards) and 2,157,657 shares of Meredith Class B Stock.

Cash-Out of Certain Meredith Equity Awards
The table below provides a summary of the cash payments that would be payable to our executive officers and directors upon consummation of the
Merger in connection with the cancellation of outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs and other Share-Based Awards, in each case,
that were held by our executive officers and directors as of August 12, 2021, in exchange for the cash consideration described above.
In addition to the cash out of Company equity awards (as adjusted as described above) upon the consummation of the Merger, unvested NMG SpinCo
stock options and unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs issued in the Spin-Off to employees of LMG RemainCo, including Patrick McCreery, will, following the
Spin-Off, be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo
Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount
payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement), or, in the case of NMG SpinCo stock options,
the excess, if any, of the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date
(or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash
Merger Agreement) less the adjusted exercise price for such option. For purposes of calculating the stock option cash out payment amounts set forth in
the table below, the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on September 30, 2021 was used to determine the relative values per share of
common stock of each of LMG RemainCo ($16.99) and NMG SpinCo and the associated adjusted exercise prices of the stock options.

Special Incentive Awards in NMG SpinCo
In connection with the Spin-Off and Merger transactions, each of Thomas Harty, Jason Frierott and John Zieser will receive special incentive awards in
NMG SpinCo in recognition of their efforts leading the Spin-Off and Merger transactions and as an incentive to remain with, and increase shareholder
value in, NMG SpinCo following the Spin-Off. The special incentive awards will be granted to Messrs. Harty, Frierott and Zieser following the Spin-Off
and will have an aggregate approximate grant date value equal to $1,500,000, $1,000,000, and $1,000,000, respectively. Fifty percent of the special incentive
awards in NMG SpinCo will be in the form of stock options and the remaining fifty percent will be in the form of restricted stock units and each award will

vest after three years, subject to each executive’s continued employment with NMG SpinCo. However, if the Dotdash Merger is consummated, the special
incentive awards will be paid in cash in lieu of stock options and restricted stock units at the time of such consummation.
Change in Control Severance Agreement
The Company previously entered into a change in control severance agreement (“CIC Agreement”) with each of Thomas Harty, Jason Frierott, John
Zieser, Patrick McCreery and Catherine Levene. The CIC Agreement provides for payments and other benefits if (i) the applicable executive is terminated
in advance of or within two years of a change in control of the Company for any reason other than death, disability, mandatory retirement, “Cause” or
termination by the executive other than for “Good Reason”, each as defined in the CIC Agreement, or (ii) the executive provides a notice of termination
for any reason during the 30 day period immediately following the first anniversary of the change in control.
With respect to Mr. McCreery, whose CIC Agreement will be retained by LMG RemainCo, the Merger will qualify as a “change in control” for purposes of
his CIC Agreement. With respect to the other executives, their respective existing CIC Agreements will be assigned to, and assumed by, NMG SpinCo
prior to the Merger in connection with the Separation, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off Agreements will not
qualify as a “change in control” for purposes of their respective CIC Agreements. See “Retention Agreements” below. In light of the foregoing, the
following description of terms of the CIC Agreement, and the amounts set forth in the “Golden Parachute” Compensation table below, assume that the
Merger constitutes a “change in control” solely for purposes of Mr. McCreery’s CIC Agreement.
Base Salary. The CIC Agreement provide for the lump sum payment of three times Mr. McCreery’s current annual base salary.
Annual Incentive. The CIC Agreement provides for the lump sum payment of three times the higher of Mr. McCreery’s target Annual Incentive or the
highest Annual Incentive paid in respect of the three fiscal years immediately prior to the year in which the change in control occurred. Mr. McCreery is
also entitled to any earned but unpaid Annual Incentive in the year of termination.
Deferred Compensation. The CIC Agreement provides for the lump sum payment of any compensation previously deferred including any accrued
interest or earnings as defined in the deferral agreements.
Pension Benefits. The CIC Agreement provides for an additional three years of age and service to be added (without affecting the life expectancy) in
calculating Mr. McCreery’s pension benefit in the event of a change in control.
Continuation of Benefits and Perquisites. The CIC Agreement provides that Mr. McCreery and his eligible dependents shall continue, to the extent
permitted by law, to be covered by all services, programs, perquisites, defined contribution plans and insurance plans in which Mr. McCreery participated
immediately prior to the time of the change in control, for a period of three years after Mr. McCreery’s date of termination, and, in the case of qualified
plan matching contributions, any amounts forfeited as of the date of termination.
Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits. The CIC Agreement provides for an additional three years of age and service to be added for purposes of determining
Mr. McCreery’s post-retirement welfare benefits (including medical, dental and life). However, even with these additional years of service, Mr. McCreery
would not meet the eligibility requirements in order to participate in the post-retirement welfare plan.
Retention Agreements
The Company entered into a Retention, Assignment and Acknowledgement Agreement (“Retention Agreement”) on August 10, 2021 with each of
Thomas Harty, Jason Frierott, John Zieser and Catherine Levene.
89
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the Retention Agreement and in connection with the Spin-Off, each applicable executive has agreed, among other things, to have his or her
existing employment agreement and CIC Agreement assumed by, and assigned to, NMG SpinCo, and acknowledged that the Separation, the Spin-Off and
the Merger do not constitute a change in control for purposes of his or her employment agreement and CIC Agreement. In addition, under the Retention
Agreement, as an incentive for each executive to remain employed with the Company through the consummation of the Spin-Off, and with NMG SpinCo
following the Spin-Off and through August 10, 2024, each executive will be eligible to earn a cash retention bonus in an amount equal to the value of a
notional number of shares of common stock of NMG SpinCo, subject to the executive’s continued employment with NMG SpinCo through August 10,
2024 (or, if the executive’s employment is terminated after the consummation of the Spin-Off and prior to August 10, 2024 by the Company without cause,
by the executive for good reason (other than due to a change in duties and responsibilities as a result of the Spin-Off), or due to the executive’s death or
disability, each as defined in the executive’s applicable agreements). The notional number of shares are as follows: Harty (265,550), Frierott (132,775),
Zieser (151,750) and Levene (113,800). Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of August 10, 2021 (less the $16.99 per share to be
received in the Merger), the indicative values of the notional shares as of August 10, 2021, are approximately: Harty ($7,000,000), Frierott ($3,500,000),
Zieser ($4,000,000) and Levene ($3,000,000). The retention bonuses will not be paid if the Spin-Off and Merger are not consummated. The CIC Agreement
for each executive will remain in effect at least through August 10, 2024, and the retention bonuses will not be paid if the executive becomes entitled to
payments under his or her CIC Agreement upon a qualifying termination following a change in control of NMG SpinCo, as defined in the executive’s CIC
Agreement, prior to August 10, 2024. Each Retention Agreement will also be assumed by, and assigned to, NMG SpinCo in connection with the
Separation and Spin-Off.
Impact of Dotdash Merger
As described above under “The Separation, Distribution, Spin-Off and Merger,” the Dotdash Merger will occur, if at all, after the consummation of the
Spin-Off and the Merger (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, in which case Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments
to the Dotdash Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement). In addition to the payments
and benefits described above that may be triggered as a result of the Spin-Off and the Merger, all NMG SpinCo stock options, restricted stock awards,
RSUs and Share-Based Awards will accelerate, be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from Dotdash equal to the $42.18 cash
per share consideration in the Dotdash Merger (subject to downward adjustment pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement), or, in the case of NMG
SpinCo stock options, the excess, if any, of $42.18 (as adjusted) less the exercise price for such stock option. The Dotdash Merger will also qualify as a
“change in control” for purposes of the CIC Agreement that the Company has entered into with each of Thomas Harty, Jason Frierott, John Zieser, and
Catherine Levene, and in connection with the Dotdash Merger, each of Messrs. Harty, Frierott and Zieser and Ms. Levene may become entitled to the
payments and benefits described above under “Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Change in Control Severance
Agreement”. To the extent Mr. Harty, Frierott or Zieser or Ms. Levene becomes entitled to the payments and benefits under his or her CIC Agreement
upon a qualifying termination following the Dotdash Merger, the retention bonus described above under “Interests of Our Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Retention Agreements” will not be paid to the applicable executive.
“Golden Parachute” Compensation
The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of “golden parachute” compensation (for purposes of Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K) that each
named executive officer of Meredith could receive in connection with the Spin-Off and the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts set forth in
the table do not reflect the impact of the Dotdash Merger, which will occur, if at all, after the consummation of the Spin-Off and the Merger (unless the
Merger Agreement is terminated, in which case Meredith and Dotdash have agreed to negotiate certain amendments to the Dotdash Merger Agreement
and the Spin-Off Agreements, subject to the terms of the Dotdash Merger Agreement). Unless otherwise specified in the accompanying footnotes, the
amounts set forth in
90
Table of Contents
the table assume that the Merger was completed, and the applicable named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination without cause or for
good reason, as of December 1, 2021. Certain of the amounts payable may vary depending on the actual dates on which the Merger is completed and
whether the named executive officer terminates employment. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ
in material respects from the amounts set forth below. As noted above, except with regard to certain equity awards that will be cashed out in connection
with the Merger (as described above under “Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Cash-Out of Certain Meredith Equity
Awards”), NMG SpinCo is obligated to assume responsibility for, pay and be liable for, all wages, salaries, welfare, incentive compensation and
employment-related liabilities, and all compensation and employment-related plans and agreements, with respect to each named executive officer (other
than Patrick McCreery).

Voting and Support Agreement
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, on May 3, 2021, Gray entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the “Support Agreement”)
with Dianna Mell Meredith Frazier and Edwin T. Meredith, IV (the “Supporting Shareholders”), Company shareholders who collectively control 1.7% of
the issued and outstanding Meredith Common Stock and approximately 89.3% of the issued and outstanding Meredith Class B Stock (representing
approximately 50.3% of the voting power when voting together as a single class) as of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, such
shareholders agreed to vote their Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and to take certain other actions
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement, the Supporting Shareholders agreed to vote or execute consents in favor of the approval and adoption
of the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby and against (i) any acquisition proposal with respect to Meredith or any other
merger, consolidation, sale
91

contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any action or proposal to amend the Meredith articles of incorporation or bylaws, and (iii) any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement involving Meredith or its subsidiaries that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede,
frustrate, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the mergers or the transaction. In addition, the Supporting Shareholders agreed not to
transfer any Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock held by them prior to the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the Merger
Agreement other than (i) pursuant to the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) with the prior written consent of Gray, (iii) a transfer of up to
100,000 shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock in the aggregate and (iv) certain transfers to affiliates and permitted transferees so
long as (A) such a transferee executes a customary joinder to the Support Agreement agreeing to be bound by its terms. The Supporting Shareholder
also agreed not to, prior to the earlier of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, convert any shares of Meredith Class B Stock into
shares of Meredith Common Stock.
Except as permitted under the Merger Agreement, the Supporting Shareholders also agreed to (and to cause their respective representatives to) cease all
discussions with any person relating to any acquisition proposal in respect of Meredith and agreed not to (and to cause their respective representatives
not to) prior to the earlier of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit any acquisition inquiries or
acquisition proposals for Meredith, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Meredith or any of its subsidiaries to any person who has made an
acquisition proposal for Meredith, (iii) knowingly engage in discussions or negotiations with any person who has made any acquisition proposal for
Meredith (other than discussions in the ordinary course of business that are unrelated to an acquisition inquiry or acquisition proposal), (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal for Meredith or withdraw or propose to withdraw its approval and recommendation in favor of the
Support Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby or (v) enter into any agreement with respect to any acquisition
proposal for Meredith. However, the Supporting Shareholders may engage in such actions to the extent such actions would be permitted to be taken by
Meredith pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The Support Agreement automatically terminates upon (i) the earlier of the effective time of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (ii) an amendment of the Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Supporting Shareholders, in a manner that
affects the economic terms of the Merger Agreement in a manner that is adverse to the Supporting Shareholders, or (iii) the extension of the “End Date”

MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
Pursuant to the IBCA, the holder of each share of Meredith Class B Stock is entitled to rights of appraisal under Section 490.1302 of the IBCA in
connection with the Merger. Appraisal rights are not available under Iowa law with respect to shares of Meredith Common Stock.
Under the IBCA, holders of Meredith Class B Stock who do not vote in favor of the Merger and who comply with the applicable provisions of Sections
490.1301 through 490.1340 of the IBCA (the “Iowa Appraisal Provisions”) will have the right, under certain circumstances, to seek appraisal of the fair
value of their Meredith Class B Stock if the Merger is completed. All holders of Meredith Class B Stock who follow the procedures set forth in the Iowa
Appraisal Provisions to perfect their appraisal rights, and who do not elect to accept payment for their shares based on Meredith’s estimate of the fair
value of the Meredith Class B Stock, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Iowa district court of Polk County (the “Iowa District Court”),
and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of those shares as determined by the Iowa District Court, together with interest, if any. It is possible
that any determination of fair value by the Iowa District Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the consideration received by the Meredith
shareholders in the Merger. Shareholders considering appraisal should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value
under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.
92Table of Contents
IN ADDITION TO SUBMITTING A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE ANY APPRAISAL RIGHTS THAT A MEREDITH
SHAREHOLDER MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SHARES OF MEREDITH CLASS B STOCK, SUCH MEREDITH SHAREHOLDER MUST
NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL AND MUST OTHERWISE FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED BY THE IOWA
APPRAISAL PROVISIONS. A SHAREHOLDER WISHING TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS MUST NOT SURRENDER ITS MEREDITH
CLASS B STOCK FOR PAYMENT IN THE MERGER.
The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions required to be followed by dissenting Meredith
shareholders wishing to demand and perfect their appraisal rights with respect to their holdings of Meredith Class B Stock. This summary, however, is not
a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, the full
text of which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions will
result in the loss of appraisal rights. All references in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions to a “shareholder” and all references in this summary to a
“shareholder” are to the record holder of Meredith Class B Stock.
Under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, Meredith is required to include in the notice of the Special Meeting a statement that the corporation has concluded
that the shareholders are, or may be, entitled to assert appraisal rights. A copy of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions must be included with that notice sent to
those record shareholders that are entitled to exercise appraisal rights.
If a shareholder wishes to consider exercising its appraisal rights, such shareholder should carefully review the text of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions set
forth in Annex C to this proxy statement and consult its legal advisor. If such shareholder fails to timely and properly comply with the requirements of the
Iowa Appraisal Provisions, its appraisal rights may be lost.
If a shareholder elects to demand appraisal of its Meredith Class B Stock, it must satisfy each of the following conditions:
•
It must deliver to Meredith a written notice of its intent to demand payment of the fair value of its Meredith Class B Stock under the Iowa
Appraisal Provisions if the proposed Merger is effectuated. It must deliver such notice to Meredith before the vote is taken on the Merger
at the Special Meeting.
•
It must not vote in favor of the Merger.
All demands for appraisal should be made in writing and addressed to:
Meredith Corporation
1716 Locust Street
Des Moines, Iowa 50309
Attention: Corporate Secretary
and must be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the Meredith Class B Stock. If a shareholder does not satisfy the above requirements, it will
not be entitled to payment pursuant to the appraisal rights.
A record shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to fewer than all the shares of Meredith Class B Stock registered in its name, but owned by a
beneficial shareholder, only if the record shareholder objects with respect to all of the Meredith Class B Stock owned by the beneficial shareholder and
notifies Meredith in writing of the name and address of each beneficial shareholder on whose behalf the appraisal rights are being asserted. The rights of
a record shareholder who asserts appraisal rights for only part of the Meredith Class B Stock held of record in its name will be determined as if the shares
as to which the record shareholder objects and the record shareholder’s other Meredith Class B Stock were registered in the names of different record
shareholders. A
93
Table of Contents
beneficial owner may assert appraisal rights as to Meredith Class B Stock held on behalf of such beneficial owner only if it submits to Meredith the
record shareholder’s written consent to the assertion of such rights no later than the date specified in the written appraisal notice (discussed below)
and does so with respect to all shares of the class that are beneficially owned by such beneficial owner.
If the Merger is completed, Meredith must send a written appraisal notice and form to each holder of Meredith Class B Stock who previously notified
Meredith of such holder’s intent to demand payment and who did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. The appraisal notice must include, among
other information, Meredith’s estimate of the fair value of the Meredith Class B Stock. A record shareholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
execute and return the form and, in a case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder’s certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the
date referred to in the notice. If a shareholder does not execute and return the form prior to the stated deadline and, in the case of certificated shares,
deposit the shareholder’s share certificates where required, the shareholder will not be entitled to payment under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions and, in
lieu thereof, will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Meredith Merger. A record shareholder who receives
notice and wishes to exercise appraisal rights must certify on the form whether beneficial ownership of the Meredith Class B Stock was acquired before
the date the principal terms of the Merger Proposal were announced publicly. If a record shareholder fails to make this certification, Meredith may elect to
treat the shareholder’s shares as “after-acquired shares” under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions as discussed below. Once a shareholder deposits its
certificates and returns the appraisal form prior to the stated deadline, such shareholder will lose its rights as a Meredith shareholder to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger and, instead, will be entitled to receive the fair value of its shares of Meredith Class B Stock
in accordance with the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, subject to certain rights of withdrawal required to be set forth in Meredith’s written appraisal notice.
Meredith will pay in cash the amount Meredith estimates to be fair value of the record shareholder’s shares, plus interest, to any record shareholder who
returns the appraisal form and complies with all provisions of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, within thirty (30) days after the form is due (except, as noted
below, with respect to shares treated as “after-acquired shares,” in which case Meredith must only make an offer to purchase such shares at the fair value
as estimated by Meredith). The payment will be accompanied by Meredith’s financial statements, a statement of Meredith’s estimate of the fair value of
the shares and a statement that shareholders entitled to payment have the right to demand further payment under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, if the
shareholders are dissatisfied with the payment made by Meredith, under certain circumstances described in detail in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.
A shareholder dissatisfied with Meredith’s payment (based on Meredith’s estimate of the fair value of the shares) may demand further payment by
notifying Meredith in writing of the shareholder’s estimate of fair value and demanding payment of such shareholder’s estimate of fair value (less the
amount of the Meredith payment previously made), plus interest. A shareholder who fails to notify Meredith of such shareholder’s demand for further
payment within thirty (30) days after receiving Meredith’s payment will waive the right to demand further payment and will be entitled only to the
payment made by Meredith. If the shareholder makes a demand for further payment based on its estimate of fair value, and such demand remains
unsettled for a period of sixty (60) days after Meredith receives such demand, Meredith will then be required to commence a proceeding in the Iowa
District Court to determine the fair value of the shares. Upon the commencement of such action, the court may appoint one or more persons to act as
appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value to the court. To the extent that the court determines that the fair
value of the shares exceed the amount of the payment previously made by Meredith, the shareholder will be entitled to judgment for the amount by which
the court’s determination of fair value exceeds the payment previously made by Meredith, plus interest.
The procedure described above is somewhat different for shares of Meredith Class B Stock that Meredith is entitled to treat as “after-acquired shares”
under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions. “After-acquired shares” are shares of Meredith Class B Stock of which beneficial ownership was acquired after the
date the principal terms
94
Table of Contents
of the Merger Proposal were publicly announced (which for these purposes includes shares of Meredith Class B Stock for which the holder failed to
certify on the appraisal form that beneficial ownership of such shares was acquired prior to the date of such public announcement). To the extent that
Meredith is entitled to treat any shares of Meredith Class B Stock as “after-acquired shares”, then Meredith must only make an offer to purchase such
shares based on Meredith’s estimate of fair value in lieu of making an actual cash payment to the shareholder upon return of the appraisal form and
deposit of certificates. If the shareholder holding shares treated as “after-acquired shares” elects to accept Meredith’s offer, then Meredith will make a
cash payment in the amount of the offer, plus interest, to such shareholder in full satisfaction of its demand under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.
If a shareholder desires to exercise its appraisal rights, it must not vote for the Merger Proposal and it must strictly comply with the procedures set
forth in the Iowa Appraisal Provisions.
The process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires strict compliance with technical prerequisites under the Iowa Appraisal Provisions. In
view of the complexity of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, Meredith shareholders who may wish to dissent from the Merger and pursue appraisal rights
with respect to their shares of Meredith Class B Stock should consult their legal advisors. Failure to take any required step in connection with
exercising appraisal rights may result in the termination or waiver of such rights. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing
summary and the Iowa Appraisal Provisions, the Iowa Appraisal Provisions will govern. The text of the Iowa Appraisal Provisions is attached hereto as
Annex C.
Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Meredith shareholders signatory thereto, who collectively control approximately 89.3% of the issued and
outstanding Meredith Class B Stock as of the Record Date, have waived such appraisal rights in writing.

The following summary is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences to our shareholders who are U.S. persons (as
defined below) who (i) receive NMG SpinCo Stock in the Distribution assuming the Distribution and the Spin-Off are consummated as contemplated
herein (ii) whose Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock is converted into cash in the Merger assuming the Merger is consummated as
contemplated herein, and (iii) whose NMG SpinCo Stock is exchanged for cash in the Dotdash Merger assuming the Dotdash Merger is consummated as
contemplated herein. This summary is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable
Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings, each as in effect as of the date hereof. These laws and authorities are subject to
differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax consequences to our shareholders as
described herein. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be sought with respect to any aspect of the transactions described
herein, and no opinion of counsel will be rendered in connection with the transactions described herein. Accordingly, the discussion below neither binds
the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a contrary position. The tax treatment of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger to our shareholders

This summary is for the general information of our shareholders only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the
Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger. Accordingly, our shareholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax
consequences to them of the Distribution, the Merger and the Dotdash Merger, including applicable federal state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences.
For example, this summary does not consider the effect of (a) any U.S. federal non-income tax laws, (b) any applicable state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws, or
(c) the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences of transactions effectuated prior to, concurrently with, or after the completion of the Distribution, the Merger or the Dotdash Merger
(whether or not such transactions occur in connection with the Distribution, the Merger or the Dotdash Merger), including, without limitation, any
transaction involving the acquisition or disposition of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock other than pursuant to the Merger,
any transaction involving the acquisition or disposition of shares of NMG SpinCo Stock other than pursuant to the Distribution or the Dotdash Merger,
the tax consequences to holders of stock options, RSUs, Share-Based Awards or similar rights to acquire Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B
Stock issued by Meredith that are converted in connection with the Merger, or the tax consequences to holders of stock options, RSUs, Share-Based
Awards or similar rights to acquire NMG SpinCo Stock issued by NMG SpinCo that are converted in connection with the Dotdash Merger. In addition, it
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may affect particular Meredith shareholders in light of their particular circumstances or to
shareholders who are subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation, shareholders who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
are not “U.S. persons” as defined below;
•
are broker-dealers, traders in securities, financial institutions, mutual funds, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
insurance companies, or tax-exempt entities;
•
hold their shares as part of an integrated investment (including a hedge or as part of a hedging, “straddle,” pledge against currency risk,
“constructive” sale or “conversion” transaction or other risk reduction transaction) consisting of shares of Meredith Common Stock or
Meredith Class B Stock and one or more other positions;
•
hold Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock that constitutes “qualified small business stock” for purposes of Section 1202 of
the Code or as “Section 1244 stock” for purposes of Section 1244 of the Code;
•
do not hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment);
•
have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
•
hold their shares through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;
•
acquired their shares in a transaction subject to the gain rollover provisions of Section 1045 of the Code;
•
acquired their shares pursuant to the settlement of RSUs or Share-Based Awards, the exercise of a compensatory option or in other
compensatory transactions;

•
are partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, S
corporations or other pass-through entities (including hybrid entities), or investors therein.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. person” is a beneficial owner of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock that is:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States or someone treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;

•
a corporation, including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

all substantial decisions of the trust, or a trust in existence on August 20, 1996, that has made a valid election under applicable Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING AND BECAUSE THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED AS A GENERAL SUMMARY ONLY, EACH
SHAREHOLDER SHOULD CONSULT SUCH SHAREHOLDER’S OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING THE
APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND ANY TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE
DISTRIBUTION AND MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS IN LIGHT OF SUCH SHAREHOLDER’S OWN TAX SITUATION.
Tax Consequences of the Distribution
The distribution by Meredith of the shares of NMG SpinCo Stock will not be eligible for treatment as a tax-free distribution. Accordingly, an amount equal
to the fair market value of the NMG SpinCo Stock received by a shareholder on the Distribution Date will be treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of
such shareholder’s ratable share of any current or accumulated earnings and profits of Meredith, with the excess treated first as a non-taxable return of
capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in its shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, and then as capital
gain. For this purpose, Meredith shareholders who acquired different blocks of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock at different
times for different prices must calculate gain or loss separately for each identifiable block of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B
Stock, as applicable, owned by such shareholder. Meredith’s earnings and profits generally will be increased by any gain recognized by Meredith as a
result of the transfer of assets between Meredith and NMG SpinCo in connection with the Spin-Off.
A shareholder’s tax basis in its shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock held on the Distribution Date will be reduced (but not
below zero) to the extent the fair market value of NMG SpinCo’s shares received by such shareholder from Meredith exceeds such shareholder’s ratable
share of Meredith’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Meredith will not be able to advise the shareholders of the amount of its earnings and
profits until after the Distribution and Merger. A shareholder’s tax basis in its shares of NMG SpinCo Stock received in the Distribution will be equal to
their fair market value as of the Distribution Date.
In addition, Meredith or other applicable withholding agents may be required to withhold at the applicable rate on all or a portion of the Distribution
payable to non-U.S. shareholders, and any such withholding would be satisfied by Meredith or the other applicable withholding agent withholding and
selling a portion of the shares of NMG SpinCo Stock otherwise distributable to non-U.S. shareholders.
Tax Consequences of the Merger
The conversion of the Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock into cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction. Generally, this means
that our shareholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (a) the amount of cash they receive in the Merger, and (b) their adjusted
tax basis in their Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable. For this purpose, Meredith shareholders who acquired different
blocks of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock at different times for different prices must calculate gain or loss separately for
each identifiable block of shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, surrendered in the exchange. As discussed in the
section titled
97
Table of Contents
“Tax Consequences of the Distribution” above, the Distribution may reduce a shareholder’s basis in their shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith
Class B Stock, as applicable, which may cause such shareholder to recognize additional capital gains (or reduced capital loss) as a result of the Merger.
Subject to various exceptions, a shareholder’s gain or loss on the disposition of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock will be characterized
as capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held their Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock,
as applicable, for more than one year as of the effective time of the Merger. If a shareholder’s holding period for any Meredith Common Stock or Meredith
Class B Stock is one year or less at the effective time of the Merger, any gain or loss with respect to such Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B
Stock will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate shareholders generally are currently
taxable at preferential rates relative to the rates applicable to other forms of income. Capital losses are subject to limitations on deductibility.
Appraisal or Dissenter’s Rights
A Meredith shareholder who exercises appraisal or dissenters’ rights for such shareholder’s Meredith Class B Stock with respect to the Merger and
receives payment for such stock in cash will generally recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the cash received and such
shareholder’s tax basis in its Meredith Class B Stock. Shareholders who exercise appraisal or dissenters’ rights are urged to consult their own tax
advisors. Interest, if any, awarded in an appraisal proceeding by a court would be included in such shareholder’s income as ordinary income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.
Tax Consequences of the Dotdash Merger
The following description of the tax consequences of the Dotdash Merger assumes that the Dotdash Merger is completed in accordance with the terms
of the Dotdash Merger Agreement as described herein. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Dotdash Merger will constitute a fully taxable
transaction for a holder of NMG SpinCo Stock and each such holder will therefore recognize gain or loss, if any, as a result of the disposition of NMG
SpinCo Stock in the Dotdash Merger.
In the Dotdash Merger, holders of NMG SpinCo Stock will recognize gain or loss, if any, equal to the difference between the cash they receive in
exchange for their shares of NMG SpinCo Stock and their adjusted tax basis in such shares of NMG SpinCo Stock surrendered in the Dotdash Merger. If
the Dotdash Merger is completed on the Distribution Date, we expect each holder of NMG SpinCo Stock to have a tax basis in their NMG SpinCo Stock
received in the Distribution that is equal to the cash received by such holder in the Dotdash Merger, in which case such a holder will not recognize gain
or loss in connection with the Dotdash Merger. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the Distribution Date, any capital gain or loss by a holder of
NMG SpinCo Stock should be short-term capital gain or loss, unless the NMG SpinCo Stock being disposed of has been held by such holder for more
than one year at the time the Dotdash Merger is completed. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate holders, including individuals,
are currently subject to taxation at preferential rates. Short-term capital gains are taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
A Meredith shareholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to certain reportable payments including taxable proceeds received in
exchange for the shareholder’s shares of Meredith Common Stock or Meredith Class B Stock, as applicable, in the Merger, or the shareholder’s shares of
NMG SpinCo Stock in the DotDash Merger. Backup withholding will generally not apply, however, to a Meredith shareholder who furnishes the exchange
agent with a correct taxpayer identification number on IRS Form W-9 (if such shareholder is a U.S. person as defined in the instructions thereto) or the
appropriate IRS Form W-8 (if the shareholder is not such a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Each
Meredith shareholder and, if applicable, each other payee, should properly complete and sign the IRS
98
Table of Contents
Form W-9 included with each applicable letter of transmittal (or the applicable IRS Form W-8) to provide the information and certification(s) necessary to
avoid the imposition of backup withholding, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent. Meredith
shareholders who fail to provide their correct taxpayer identification numbers and the appropriate certifications, or to establish an exemption as described
above, will be subject to backup withholding on cash they receive in the Merger and/or DotDash Merger, as applicable, and may be subject to penalties
imposed by the IRS. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against the tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Meredith shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining
such an exemption. If the exchange agent withholds on a payment to a shareholder, the affected shareholder should contact its tax advisor regarding
whether and how any refund, credit or other tax benefit might be recognized with respect to any such withheld amounts.

INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISTRIBUTION, THE MERGER OR THE DOTDASH MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE DISCUSSION DOES

MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
FCC Matters
Under U.S. federal communications laws, Meredith and Gray may not complete the Merger unless they have first obtained the FCC’s consent. FCC
consent is sought through the filing of transfer of control applications with the FCC, which are subject to public comment and objections from third
parties. The applications for FCC consent to the transaction were filed by Meredith and Gray on May 14, 2021.
The applications for consent to transfer the Meredith broadcast licenses to Gray involve a change of more than 50% of the voting rights representing
ultimate control of Meredith and its broadcast subsidiaries and thus will constitute a “substantial” change in ownership or control of the Meredith
licensees within the meaning of the FCC’s rules. Accordingly, the FCC must provide public notice for a period of 30 days prior to acting on the
applications. During that period, interested parties, including members of the public, may file informal objections to the applications or petitions to deny
the applications. The filing of a petition to deny a transfer application or an informal objection could delay FCC processing of the applications. The
deadline for filing petitions to deny applications was June 25, 2021. One viewer filed comments that are not specific to the proposed transaction and Gray
and Meredith jointly filed a response to the comments. Also, a company that sells outdoor television antennas filed the Objection proposing that the FCC
impose a condition on its approval of the transaction requiring Gray to accept reasonable advertisement requests from vendors of over-the-air antennas.
Meredith and Gray responded to the Objection and asked the FCC to process the transaction without delay. To facilitate regulatory approvals for the
Merger, Gray agreed to divest WJRT-TV in the Flint-Saginaw DMA, the only market in which both Gray and Meredith operate stations. On July 14, 2021,
Gray announced an agreement to divest WJRT-TV pursuant to an agreement with Allen Media. On July 23, 2021, Gray filed an application seeking
consent to assign the license for WJRT-TV to Allen Media. On July 27, 2021, the FCC issued a public notice accepting the application and establishing
August 26, 2021 as the deadline for filing petitions to deny. The FCC granted the WJRT-TV assignment application on September 10, 2021, and Gray and
Allen Media consummated the WJRT-TV transaction on September 23, 2021.
In determining whether to approve the transfer of control of a television broadcast licensee or an assignment of license, the FCC considers a number of
factors pertaining to the proposed licensee, including compliance with
99Table of Contents
various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding significant voting or positional
interests in the licensee or in the entities controlling the licensee, the Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”) limitations on foreign
ownership and control of broadcast licensees, and compliance with FCC rules and regulations. The timing or outcome of the FCC approval process
cannot be predicted.
Meredith and Gray have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable any necessary consent, approval, waiver and
authorization of any governmental entity in connection with the transaction. For a further description, see “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Close the
Merger” beginning on page 117.
Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act, and the related rules and regulations that have been issued by the FTC, certain acquisitions may not be consummated, nor may the
acquiring party direct the operations of the acquired company, until certain information and documentary material has been furnished for review by the
FTC and the Antitrust Division and waiting period requirements have been observed. These requirements apply to the Merger.
Under the HSR Act, the Merger may not be completed until the expiration or earlier termination of a thirty-calendar day waiting period, which began when
Meredith and Gray filed a Notification and Report Form, together with required documentary attachments, with the FTC and the Antitrust Division on
May 14, 2021. On June 14, 2021, the Antitrust Division issued a Second Request. The Second Request defines the “Relevant Area” as the Flint-Saginaw-
Bay City, Michigan DMA and the “Relevant Product” as “the sale of spot advertising time on broadcast television stations.” The issuance of a Second
Request extends the waiting period until thirty calendar days after Meredith and Gray comply with the Second Request or until the Antitrust Division
terminates the waiting period.
At any time before or after the completion of the transaction, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as either
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking to unwind the Merger or seeking
the divestiture of assets of Meredith or Gray (or their respective subsidiaries). To address potential antitrust concerns with the Merger and to comply
with FCC rules, on July 14, 2021, Gray announced an agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA to Allen
Media Broadcasting, LLC. On September 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of WJRT-
TV. On September 23, 2021, Gray consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in the
same DMA. The Antitrust Division informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8, 2021,
the waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated.
State attorneys general may also bring legal action under both state and federal antitrust laws, as applicable. Private parties may also bring legal action
under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Financing of the Transactions,"Financing of the Transactions
NMG SpinCo
Meredith anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately $45 million, in addition to the
funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith, which will be approximately $625 million, which amount is subject to
adjustment as further described in this proxy statement. This amount is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand
(which will be taken into account in determining the amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment) and through borrowings under a new senior credit facility from
the SpinCo Debt Financing or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced
by Dotdash, in connection with the Dotdash Merger.
100Table of Contents
To provide the debt financing required by Meredith to fund the SpinCo Cash Payment, Meredith entered into the Existing SpinCo Commitment Letter,
dated June 25, 2021 (amending and restating its financing commitment letter dated May 3, 2021, as amended and restated May 24, 2021), with the Initial
Lenders. In connection with entering into the Dotdash Merger Agreement, and to facilitate the SpinCo Cash Payment obligations of Meredith (should the
Dotdash Merger not be completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger), Meredith has (i) terminated the Existing SpinCo
Commitment Letter and (ii) entered the SpinCo Commitment Letter with the Commitment Parties on October 6, 2021, pursuant to which Meredith has
received commitments from the Commitment Parties to provide to SpinCo (i) the Term Loan Facility, secured term loans in an aggregate principle amount
of $725 and (2) the Revolving Facility, a secured revolving commitment in an aggregate principal amount of $150 million. The borrower under the Facilities
will be a designated subsidiary of NMG SpinCo and the obligations of the borrower will be guaranteed by NMG SpinCo and the subsidiaries of the
borrower (subject to customary exceptions to be agreed). The amount of initial borrowings under the Facilities will be determined prior to the closing date
of the Merger based on the total amount of funds necessary for NMG SpinCo to make the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith (which, in turn, will depend
on the actual amount of Meredith’s net debt on the closing date of the Merger) and to pay transaction fees and expenses.
The obligation of Meredith and Gray to consummate the Merger is subject to completion of the Distribution and Spin-Off. The obligation of Meredith to
consummate the Distribution and Spin-Off is subject to the consummation and funding of the Facilities in accordance with the SpinCo Commitment Letter
and payment of the SpinCo Cash Payment to Meredith in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
Funding of the Facilities is subject to customary conditions, including the negotiation of definitive documentation for the Facilities, that no material
adverse effect on the financial condition, business or operations of SpinCo has occurred and other customary closing conditions consistent with the
Merger Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
Among other termination rights, the obligations of the Commitment Parties under the SpinCo Commitment Letter will terminate automatically upon the
earliest to occur of: (a) the earlier of (1) September 3, 2022 and (2) May 3, 2022 plus (x) in the event that the Separation shall not have been consummated
on or prior to such date due solely to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals (including any regulatory approvals required under the Merger
Agreement, one automatic extension of three months and (y) if the Marketing Period (as defined in the SpinCo Commitment Letter) has commenced and
has not ended by the last business day immediately prior to May 3, 2022 (or if extended pursuant to the foregoing clause (x), the date that is three months
following such date), the fifth business day following the end of the Marketing Period, if in either case of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), the Closing
Date shall not have occurred by such date, (b) consummation of the Separation without the funding of the facilities contemplated by the SpinCo
Commitment Letter, (c) the date of execution and delivery of the definitive documentation for the Facilities, (d) the termination of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the funding of the Facilities and (e) the
consummation of the Dotdash Merger.
Further, the SpinCo Commitment Letter includes a customary marketing period to be completed prior to the closing date of the Facilities. Meredith is
entitled to delay the Distribution until the date on which the proceeds of the SpinCo Debt Financing are available in full in accordance with the SpinCo
Commitment Letter. Also, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the completion of the Merger will not occur prior to December 1, 2021, unless mutually
agreed by the parties.
The Meredith Commitment Letter provides for an end date that is coterminous with the end date under the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Meredith has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain financing for the transaction on the terms described
above.
101
Table of Contents
In the event Gray or Meredith is entitled to terminate, and elects to terminate, the Merger Agreement at the “End Date” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) prior to completion of the Merger and, at such time, all of the conditions to Meredith’s obligation to consummate the Distribution, Spin-Off
and Merger have been satisfied (other than the conditions that the SpinCo Debt Financing has been consummated and funded and that the SpinCo Cash
Payment has been made), Meredith will be obligated to pay a termination fee to Gray in the amount of $73 million.
Gray
Gray anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to finance the transactions and to pay transaction fees and expenses will be approximately
$2.89 billion. This amount is expected to be funded through one or more of the following sources: available cash on hand, the issuance and sale by Gray
of notes in a public offering or in a Rule 144A private placement, and borrowings under the Gray term loan facility and bridge facility as described below.
To provide the debt financing required by Gray to consummate the Merger, Gray has entered into the Gray Commitment Letter, dated June 2, 2021
(amending and restating its financing commitment letter, dated May 3, 2021) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and the other lenders party
thereto, pursuant to which the lenders have committed to provide the debt financing for a portion of the purchase price to be paid to complete the Merger
and the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of Meredith, with an incremental term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion
and a bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.475 billion less the principal amount of any notes issued prior to the date of completion of the
Merger. The funding under the Gray Commitment Letter is subject to customary conditions for commitments of this type, including but not limited to:
•
completion of the Merger and Spin-Off substantially concurrently with funding;
•
the absence of a Material Adverse Effect on Meredith’s LMG segment (defined in the debt commitment in a manner consistent with the
definition of Material Adverse Effect applicable to Meredith in the Merger Agreement);
•
repayment of substantially all existing material third party debt for borrowed money of Meredith, including Meredith’s Senior Secured Notes
due 2025 and Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026;
•
solvency of Gray after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the incurrence of the debt financing;
•
delivery of financial information; and
•
the accuracy of certain fundamental representations and warranties.
While the obligation of Gray to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition, the Gray Commitment Letter includes a customary
marketing period and, without Gray’s and Meredith’s agreement, the closing of the Merger will not occur earlier than (i) December 1, 2021 or (ii) the
completion of the marketing period (unless the marketing period is scheduled to be completed after December 30, 2021, in which event the closing of the
Merger will occur on December 30, 2021).
The Gray Commitment Letter provides for an end date that is coterminous with the end date under the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Gray has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain financing for the transaction on the terms described
above, and Meredith has agreed to provide cooperation reasonably requested by Gray in connection with the financing described above or any
alternative debt financing.
In the event Meredith is entitled to terminate, and elects to terminate, the Merger Agreement prior to completion of the Merger and all of the conditions to
Gray’s obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied, Gray will be obligated to pay a termination fee to Meredith in the amount of $125 million.

Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock
At the Effective Time, and without any action required by the Company, Gray, Merger Sub or any shareholder, each share of Meredith Common Stock and
Meredith Class B Stock (other than shares (i) to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.6(a) of the Merger Agreement and (ii) subject to Section 2.8 of
the Merger Agreement regarding dissenting shares of Meredith Class B Stock) that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will automatically be cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $16.99 per share, without interest
thereon, and any unpaid dividends declared but unpaid in respect of such shares, in each case subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.9 of the Merger Agreement.
Outstanding Options, RSUs, and Share-Based Awards
At the Effective Time, (i) each in-the-money option award (after giving effect to the adjustment to exercise price in connection with the Spin-Off) with
respect to Meredith Common Stock outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, (ii)
each RSU with respect to Meredith Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) each Share-Based Award
104Table of Contents
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled, and shall
only entitle the holder thereof to receive from Gray an amount of cash equal to $16.99 per share (or in the case of stock options, the excess, if any, of
$16.99 over the adjusted exercise price of such option), without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding.
Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement, prior to the Effective Time and in connection with the Spin-Off, each
outstanding stock option granted under Meredith’s equity plans will be converted into two options: (1) an adjusted Company stock option that will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in the Merger as described above, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares. The
number of shares subject to the adjusted Company stock option and the NMG SpinCo stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the
related Company stock option prior to the Spin-Off, but the exercise prices will be adjusted to reflect the value of LMG relative to NMG based on the
trading price of Meredith Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date relative to the “when-issued” trading price of
NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the
cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement). The sum of the exercise prices for
the adjusted Company stock option and the NMG SpinCo stock option will equal the current exercise price of the related Company stock option prior to
adjustment and the Spin-Off. The NMG SpinCo stock options will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related
Company stock option award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo stock options held by employees of LMG will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the excess, if any, of the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo
Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount
payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement) less the adjusted exercise price for such option.
Prior to the Effective Time, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of outstanding RSUs and Share-Based Awards granted under Meredith’s equity plans
will receive RSUs and Share-Based Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares subject to the related Company award prior to the
Spin-Off. The NMG SpinCo RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related Company
award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately
prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo
Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement).
Treatment of Dissenting Shares of Meredith Class B Stock
With respect to each share of Meredith Class B Stock to which the holder thereof has properly demanded appraisal in compliance with IBCA Section
490.1321 (each, a “Dissenting Share”), if any, such holder will be entitled to payment, solely from LMG RemainCo, of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of IBCA Section 490.1324 (except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders
of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to the IBCA will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, subject to compliance with Section 2.9 of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described under the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”).

Gray, dated November 17, 2020 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) (provided that any such agreement shall contain a standstill no less beneficial to the
Company in the aggregate than the standstill in the Confidentiality Agreement prohibiting a counterparty from acquiring any additional equity or voting

its obligation to provide any disclosure to Gray required pursuant to Section 7.3 of the Merger Agreement.

Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries or afford access to its business, properties, assets, books or

statement approving, endorsing or recommending, a Company Acquisition Proposal or, subject to Section 7.3(e), effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (iv) enter into any letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement providing for a Company Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).
“Company Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal or indication of interest (whether or not in writing) from any person (other than Gray and its
subsidiaries) or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) relating to or involving, whether in a single transaction or series of related
transactions: (a) any direct or indirect acquisition, lease, exchange, license, transfer, disposition (including by way of merger, liquidation or dissolution of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or LMG RemainCo and the RemainCo Subsidiaries) or purchase of any business, businesses or assets (including
equity interests in subsidiaries but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or LMG

Company and its subsidiaries or LMG RemainCo and the RemainCo Subsidiaries, in each case on a consolidated basis; (b) any merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, sale of securities, reorganization, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange
offer, liquidation, dissolution, extraordinary dividend, or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or LMG RemainCo and the
RemainCo Subsidiaries and a person or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company or

such transaction immediately following such transaction; or (c) any combination of the foregoing.
“Superior Company Proposal” means a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal from any person (other than Gray and its subsidiaries) (with all
references to “20% or more” in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal being deemed to reference “90% or more” and all references to “less than

consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
shareholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements after taking into account all
factors that the Board deems relevant (including any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed in writing by Gray prior to the time of such
determination).

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation that the shareholders of the Company vote
“FOR” the Merger Proposal (“Company Board Recommendation”).
Except as specifically provided in the Merger Agreement, at no time after the date of the Merger Agreement may the Board or any committee thereof take
any of the following actions (any such action, a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”):
•
withdrawing, rescinding, amending, changing, modifying or qualifying, or otherwise proposing publicly to withdraw, rescind, amend,
change, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Gray, the Company Board Recommendation;
•
failing to make, withdrawing, or amending the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy statement mailed to shareholders;
•
adopting, approving, endorsing, or recommending, or otherwise proposing publicly to adopt, approve, endorse, or recommend, any
Company Acquisition Proposal;
•
taking any action to exempt or make any person (other than Gray and its subsidiaries and affiliates) not subject to any applicable anti-
takeover or similar statute or regulation; or
•
if a Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed, failing to publicly recommend against such Company Acquisition Proposal
within ten business days of the request of Gray and to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within such ten business day period
upon such request (provided that such a request may be delivered by Gray only once with respect to each Company Acquisition Proposal,
with the right to make an additional request with respect to each subsequent material amendment or modification thereto).
The Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or authorize the Company to
terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
substantially concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement, in each case, if:
•
a Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement and such Company Acquisition Proposal
is not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or there has been an Intervening Event (as defined below);
•
in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal;
•
the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;
•
(A) the Board provides Gray at least five business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify,
in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, and attaching a copy of any proposed agreements for the Superior Company Proposal, if applicable, it being understood that the
delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (B) during the five business days
following such written notice, the Board and its representatives negotiate in good faith with Gray (to the extent Gray desires to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger and related transactions proposed by Gray in response to such Superior Company
Proposal or Intervening Event (as defined below), as applicable, as would enable the Board to maintain the Company Board
Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, terminate the
115Table of Contents
Merger Agreement; and (C) at the end of the five business day period described in the foregoing clause (B), the Board concluded in good
faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment
or modification of the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Gray), that, as applicable (i) the Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or (ii) the Intervening Event (as defined below) continues to warrant a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable laws; and
•
in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall have terminated the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, including paying (or causing to be paid) the applicable Company Break Fee (as defined
below).
“Intervening Event” means any event, condition, fact, occurrence, change or development (not related to a Company Acquisition Proposal) that is not
known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement and does not relate to a Company Acquisition Proposal, a Superior
Company Proposal, or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, which event, condition, fact, occurrence, change or development becomes
known to the Board prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval; provided that (A) in no event shall any action taken by the parties pursuant
to the affirmative covenants set forth in Section 7.1 of the Merger Agreement, or the consequences of any such action, constitute, be deemed to
contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event and (B) in no event shall any event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence that would fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of “Company Material Adverse Effect” constitute,
be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether here has been an “Intervening Event”.",123,124
MEREDITH CORP_20211108_DEFM14A_19636450_4328874.Pdf,Employee Benefits,"Employee Benefits
The Merger Agreement provides that, for a period of six months following the Effective Time or, if shorter, the period of employment following the
Effective Time of the relevant employee, Gray shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to provide, each individual who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is an employee of the Company who primarily provides services to the LMG RemainCo business (excluding any
employees represented by labor unions and/or covered by collective bargaining agreements) (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) base salary or
other base cash compensation that are at least the same as that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash
incentive compensation opportunities (including short-term annual cash incentive compensation but excluding long-term cash or equity based-
compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than that provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
severance and any other termination pay and benefits plans, practices and policies that are no less favorable that which were applicable to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate that
which are then provided to similarly situated employees of Gray or its subsidiaries.
Additionally, soon as reasonably practical following the Closing, Gray shall, and/or shall cause LMG RemainCo and its subsidiaries to, pay each
employee who primarily provides services to the LMG RemainCo Business, including those on a leave of absence or short-term disability as of the
Effective Time (each, a “RemainCo Employee”) a pro-rated cash bonus amount (based on the number of days from July 1, 2021 through and including
the Closing Date divided by 365), calculated based on such RemainCo Employee’s target annual bonus amount under the applicable annual (or other
short-term) cash incentive award program.
From and after the Effective Time, Gray shall, and shall cause LMG RemainCo and its subsidiaries to (a) honor the accrued and vested obligations of LMG
RemainCo and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
116Table of Contents
under the Employee Plans of the Company (including any accrued, unused paid time off of Continuing Employees through the end of the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs) and (b) provide, employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and who continue employment with Gray or
any of its subsidiaries, including LMG RemainCo, with compensation and benefits in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement as
amended, extended or terminated from time to time in accordance with its terms and applicable law.
For purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, benefit accrual, and paid time off accrual (excluding benefit accruals under defined benefit pension
plans, post-retirement benefit plans or any discretionary 401(k) plan match) under the employee benefit plans, severance arrangements, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Gray and its subsidiaries (including LMG RemainCo) in which Continuing Employees may become eligible to
participate in after the Closing (the “New Benefit Plans”), each Continuing Employee will be credited with the same amount of service as was credited by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under similar or comparable Employee Plans of the Company in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation).
Additionally, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable New Benefit Plans, each Continuing Employee will be eligible to participate in such
New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable
Employee Plan of the Company. For purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Gray shall, or shall cause LMG RemainCo and its subsidiaries to, for the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs, use
reasonable best efforts to (A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and their covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any
similar or comparable Employee Plan of the Company in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Employee
Plan of the Company ending on the date such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Benefit Plan. Gray or an applicable Subsidiary will permit rollovers of any 401(k) plan loans and 401(k) plan accounts for Continuing Employees (and any
employees represented by labor unions and/or covered by the collective bargaining agreements who will continue service for the Gray or any of its
subsidiaries following the Closing) and NMG SpinCo, the Company, Gray and LMG RemainCo will cooperate to take the actions needed to provide for
such rollovers, including any Employee Plan of the Company or New Benefit Plan amendments.

Each of the Company and Gray has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, certain actions, to do, or cause to be done, all
things incidental to such actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable, including: (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the other parties,
with any governmental authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining (and cooperating with each other to
obtain or maintain) all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any governmental
authority or other third party, in each case, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Divestiture); provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in the Merger
Agreement, no party shall be required to pay (and, without the prior written consent of Gray (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), none of the Company or its subsidiaries shall
117Table of Contents
pay or agree to pay) any fee, penalty or other consideration to any other third party (other than any filing fees paid or payable to any governmental
authority) for any approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization or other confirmation required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The parties have also agreed to make certain regulatory filings as described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal
1—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,” including filing (i) with the FTC and the Antitrust Division a Notification and Report Form relating to
the Merger Agreement and the Merger as required by the HSR Act within 10 business days following the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) with the
FCC, the applications required to be filed to obtain the approvals of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act and FCC rules within 10 business days
following the date of the Merger Agreement, the filing fees to be split equally between Gray and the Company (other than the filing fees related to the
Divestiture, which shall be paid by Gray). Each of Gray and the Company agreed to respond promptly to all requests for additional information and
documentary material by a governmental authority, and to comply promptly with such requests unless Gray and Company agree with each other to defer
compliance, and to use reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary and appropriate to obtain all necessary approvals and to cause the
expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods as soon as practicable so as to permit consummation of the contemplated transactions as soon as
practicable.
Each of Gray and the Company agree, unless prohibited by law, not to participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive or procedural
conversation with any governmental authority in respect of the Merger without the other, to give the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or
conversation and in the event one such party is prohibited by applicable law or by the applicable governmental authority from participating or attending
any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep the non-participating party reasonably apprised with respect thereto.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Gray and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, take all actions reasonably
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law so as to enable the consummation of the Merger to occur as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement), including taking all actions requested by any
governmental authority, or reasonably necessary to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to the
Merger under any antitrust law. Gray shall oppose fully and vigorously any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order,
judgment, decree, injunction or ruling of any governmental authority that could restrain, prevent or delay any required consents pursuant to any antitrust
laws applicable to the Merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by any person in any court or before any governmental
authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing properly any adverse decision or order by any governmental authority, it being
understood that the costs and expenses of all such actions shall be borne by Gray.
Nothing in the Merger Agreement will require the Company or Gray to take certain specified actions (including divestitures) with respect to obtaining
regulatory approval of the Merger except as specifically agreed by the parties in the Merger Agreement. To facilitate regulatory approvals for the Merger,
Gray agreed to divest WJRT-TV in the Flint-Saginaw DMA, the only market in which both Gray and the Company operated stations.
On July 14, 2021, Gray announced an agreement to divest its WJRT-TV station in the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, Michigan DMA to Allen Media. On
September 21, 2021, the Antitrust Division advised that it had no objections to Allen Media Group as the buyer of WJRT-TV. On September 23, 2021, Gray
consummated the sale of WJRT-TV to Allen Media. As a result, Gray and Meredith no longer operate stations in the same DMA. The Antitrust Division
informed Meredith on September 28, 2021 that it has closed its investigation of the Merger, and on October 8, 2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act
was terminated.
The parties have agreed to (and will cause their respective subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable laws, (i) cooperate and consult
with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
118

governmental authority or any investigation or other inquiry by or before a governmental authority relating to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing the other party to have a reasonable opportunity to
review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions, (ii) promptly inform the other party of (and if in writing, supply to the other party)
any substantive or procedural communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ, the FCC or any other similar
governmental authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, (iii) consult with each
other prior to taking any material position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC rules in discussions with
or filings to be submitted to any governmental authority, (iv) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any governmental
authority with respect to filings under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC rules and (v) coordinate with the other in preparing and
exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of
any oral presentations) made by such party with any governmental authority relating to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby
under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC rules; provided, that documents or information required to be provided may be redacted or
designated as “outside counsel only” as necessary.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement
The Separation and Distribution Agreement governs the terms and conditions by which the Company’s assets are to be transferred, liabilities are to be
assumed and contracts are to be assigned to or retained by NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo as part of the separation of the Company’s NMG business
segment and corporate functions from its LMG business segment, and it provides for when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments will
occur.
Separation—Allocation of Assets and Liabilities Between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo
The Separation and Distribution Agreement allocates the assets and liabilities of the Company between NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo as follows:
•
all assets that relate primarily to the business conducted by the LMG business segment, which owns and operates broadcast television
stations, will be transferred to or retained by LMG RemainCo, including (1) all issued and outstanding capital stock of, or equity interests in
any subsidiaries of the Company primarily relating to the LMG business segment, (2) all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
sufficient to allow LMG RemainCo to conduct the LMG business as currently conducted prior to Closing, including the rights relating to the
LMG RemainCo portion of any shared contract, and (3) the proceeds of the SpinCo Cash Payment to be made by NMG SpinCo to LMG
RemainCo;
•
all assets other than those described to be allocated to LMG RemainCo, will be transferred to NMG SpinCo, including (1) corporate function
assets, including the corporate headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, the corporate name “Meredith Corporation” and the NYSE ticker symbol
(MDP), (2) all issued and outstanding capital stock of, or equity interests in any subsidiaries of the Company that are not allocated to LMG
RemainCo, including MNI and People TV, and (3) the rights relating to the NMG SpinCo portion of any shared contract;
•
certain liabilities will be assumed by or retained by LMG RemainCo, including (i) all liabilities arising out of assets allocated to LMG
RemainCo or from the operation of the LMG business segment, including any terminated, divested or discontinued portion of the LMG
business segment, before, during, or after the Distribution, (ii) LMG RemainCo’s obligations under its portion of any shared contract, (iii) all
existing indebtedness of the Company, (iv) certain litigation relating to the LMG business segment, (v) liabilities allocated to LMG
RemainCo pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, and (vi) liabilities allocated to LMG RemainCo pursuant to the Tax Matters
Agreement; and
•
all liabilities not expressly allocated to LMG RemainCo will be assumed by NMG SpinCo, including (i) all liabilities arising out of the assets
allocated to NMG SpinCo or from the operation of the NMG business segment before, during, or after the Distribution, (ii) NMG SpinCo’s
obligations under its portion of any shared contract, (iii) all liabilities pursuant to the SpinCo Debt Financing, (iv) all liabilities of the
Company in respect of shareholder and securities litigation relating to the Form 10 and the Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements
arising between signing the Merger Agreement and closing the Merger, (v) certain transaction expenses and pre-closing liabilities of the
Company, (vi) certain liabilities relating to the indemnification of any present or past director or officer of the Company, (viii) liabilities
allocated to NMG SpinCo pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, and (ix) liabilities allocated to NMG SpinCo pursuant to the Tax
Matters Agreement.
NMG SpinCo Cash Payment
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that as part of the Separation, NMG SpinCo will pay to LMG RemainCo the SpinCo Cash Payment
such that the net debt of the Company (exclusive of the NMG SpinCo debt and after giving effect to the SpinCo Cash Payment), would be equal to $1.975
billion on the date of the Closing, subject to certain adjustments, which will be used by Gray to satisfy all of the Company’s
126
Table of Contents
outstanding long-term debt as of the date of the Closing. The amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment is subject to certain adjustments, including the
following:
•
the SpinCo Cash Payment will be decreased by the product of (x) $16.99 and (y) 511,600 less the number of equity awards actually awarded
by the Company to employees and directors between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger;
•
the SpinCo Cash Payment will be decreased or increased, as applicable, by the amount by which the aggregate Merger Consideration
actually paid in respect of Meredith stock options is less than or more than $14,404,530;
•
the SpinCo Cash Payment will be decreased by $25,983,750 (as a result of the redemption of warrants to purchase Meredith Common Stock,
which were redeemed in accordance with their terms on June 30, 2021).
•
pursuant to the Consent Agreement, the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result, the SpinCo Cash Payment will be
increased) by $30,000,000; provided, however, that if the Company provides the financial statements comprising the RemainCo Required
Financial Information described in the Consent Agreement, then the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result, the SpinCo
Cash Payment will instead be increased) by only $25,000,000; and
•
pursuant to the Consent Agreement, if the closing of the Merger occurs but does not occur on or before December 1, 2021, then, for each
day thereafter until the closing, the target net debt amount will be reduced (and as a result, the SpinCo Cash Payment will be increased by)
$725,000 per day, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Consent Agreement.
The final amount of the SpinCo Cash Payment does not affect or reduce the $16.99 cash payment per share to be received in the Gray Merger. The SpinCo
Cash Payment is expected to be funded through the following sources: available cash on hand and through borrowings under the SpinCo Debt Financing
or, if the Dotdash Merger is completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger, through funds advanced by Dotdash, in connection
with the Dotdash Merger.
Distribution
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that, on the Distribution Date, each holder of Meredith Common Stock as of the Distribution Record
Date will receive shares of NMG SpinCo Common Stock and each holder of Meredith Class B Stock as of the Distribution Record Date will receive shares
of NMG SpinCo Class B Stock, in each case on a one-for-one basis such that NMG SpinCo will maintain a dual-class capital structure. Following the
Distribution, the Company’s pre-Distribution shareholders will collectively hold 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NMG SpinCo.
Conditions to the Distribution
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that the completion of the Distribution is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
specifically:
•
each of the conditions to Merger Agreement has been fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the closing of the Merger, provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied) and Gray has confirmed to the Company
in writing that it is prepared to consummate the Merger, subject only to the completion of the Distribution and the SpinCo Cash Payment;
•
the Separation shall have been substantially completed in accordance with the agreed plan of separation;
•
the SpinCo Debt Financing shall have been consummated and funded in full in accordance with the SpinCo Commitment Letter (except that,
pursuant to the Consent Agreement, this condition can be
127
Table of Contents
satisfied without full funding of the SpinCo Debt Financing to the extent the Dotdash Merger closes on the same day as the Spin-Off and
the Merger and the SpinCo Cash Payment is fully paid through funds advanced by Dotdash, subject to the terms of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement);
•
the SpinCo Cash Payment shall have been made from NMG SpinCo to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement;
•
the Form 10 filed with the SEC shall have been declared effective by the SEC and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form 10
shall be in effect, no proceedings for such purpose shall be pending before or threatened by the SEC, and the information statement shall
have been mailed to holders of Meredith Common Stock as of the Distribution Record Date;
•
prior to the Distribution Date, such registration statements on Form S-8 as are necessary to register the equity awards of NMG SpinCo held
by or made available to directors and employees of NMG SpinCo shall have been filed with the SEC;
•
all actions and filings with respect to the NMG SpinCo Common Stock and NMG SpinCo Class B Stock necessary under applicable federal,
state or foreign securities or “blue sky” laws and the rules and regulations thereunder shall have been taken and, where applicable, become
effective or been accepted;
•
NMG SpinCo shall have obtained an opinion from a nationally-recognized firm as to the solvency of NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo after
giving effect to the Distribution and the SpinCo Cash Payment;
•
the NMG SpinCo Common Stock to be delivered in the Distribution shall have been accepted for listing on the NYSE, subject to compliance
with applicable listing requirements; and
•
no injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction shall have been entered and shall continue to be in effect and no law
shall have been adopted or be effective preventing consummation of the Distribution or any of the transactions contemplated by the Spin-
Off Agreements or the Merger.
Timing of the Distribution
Subject to the Company’s ability to legally declare and pay the dividend represented by the Distribution at such time under applicable law, the Company
shall consummate the Separation and Distribution as promptly as reasonably practicable after satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Distribution,
provided that the Company is entitled to delay the Distribution until the later to occur (1) ten days after the date on which the Distribution would
otherwise occur to the extent necessary to comply with any NYSE rules relating to notices of record dates and dividends and (2) the date on which the
proceeds of the SpinCo Debt Financing are available in full in accordance with the SpinCo Commitment Letter.
Efforts
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that the parties must use their reasonable best efforts prior to and after the Distribution Date to
cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, as in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of the
Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Releases
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, each party (NMG SpinCo and LMG RemainCo) releases and
forever discharges the other party and their respective affiliates and assigns, from all liabilities existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or
failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed on or before the
128
Table of Contents
time of the Distribution. The releases do not extend to or amend obligations or liabilities under any agreements between the parties that remain in effect
following the time of the Distribution, including their obligations and liabilities to each other under the Merger Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements.
Indemnification
In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for mutual indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the
obligations and liabilities of the NMG business segment and corporate functions with NMG SpinCo and financial responsibility for the obligations and
liabilities of the LMG business segment with LMG RemainCo after the time of the Separation and Distribution. In general, each party (NMG SpinCo and
LMG RemainCo) will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and subsidiaries and its officers, directors, employees and agents
for any losses arising out of or otherwise in connection with the liabilities that each such party assumed or retained pursuant to the Separation and
Distribution Agreement and the other Spin-Off Agreements.
Insurance
The Separation and Distribution Agreement generally provides that all insurance policies (and rights and obligations thereunder) will be transferred to
NMG SpinCo as part of the Separation and that, after the time of the Distribution, LMG RemainCo will not have any rights to or under any of NMG
SpinCo’s insurance policies, provided that in the event any insurable loss or damage occurs to the Company’s television station assets prior to Closing,
and the payment has not been received prior to Closing, NMG SpinCo agrees to pay over the insurance proceeds after receipt.
Litigation
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that all litigation actions pending as of the time of the Distribution will be assumed by NMG
SpinCo, except for certain litigation actions relating to the LMG business segment, which will be retained or assumed by LMG RemainCo.
We encourage you to read the Separation and Distribution Agreement carefully because it is the principal document governing the Separation and
Distribution and forms a critical part of the transactions.

The Employee Matters Agreement
The Employee Matters Agreement generally allocates liabilities and responsibilities relating to employees, employee compensation and benefit plans and
programs of the Company as part of the separation of the Company’s NMG business segment and corporate functions from its LMG business segment.
Transfer of Employment
Under the Employee Matters Agreement, as part of the Separation, current and former employees and independent contractors who primarily provide (or
primarily provided prior to termination) services to the LMG business segment, plus certain other specified individuals, will be allocated to LMG
RemainCo (“LMG service providers”), and current and former employees and independent contractors who are not LMG service providers will be
allocated to NMG SpinCo (“NMG service providers”). Under the Employee Matters Agreement, the Company and NMG SpinCo will each use reasonable
best efforts to cause the employment of (or, with respect to independent contractors, engagement of) each NMG service provider to be transferred to
NMG SpinCo as part of the Separation.
Assumption and Retention of Liabilities
Subject to certain exceptions, under the Employee Matters Agreement, NMG SpinCo will assume or retain all employment-related and service-related
liabilities with respect to NMG service providers and directors, including (i) all liabilities relating to the Company’s and NMG SpinCo’s health and welfare
plans, compensation plans and retirement plans, and (ii) all liabilities with respect to the employment or termination of employment of all NMG service
providers.
Subject to certain exceptions, under the Employee Matters Agreement, LMG RemainCo will assume or retain all liabilities relating to LMG service
providers, including all employment-related and service-related liabilities, including (i) all liabilities relating to the Company’s health and welfare plans,
compensation plans and retirement plans, and (ii) all liabilities with respect to the employment or termination of employment of all LMG service providers.
Under the Employee Matters Agreement, NMG SpinCo has agreed assume certain liabilities after the Distribution for certain LMG employees (e.g.,

Sponsorship of Plans
Under the Employee Matters Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, NMG SpinCo will assume sponsorship of certain Company benefit plans.
Labor Relations
Under the Employee Matters Agreement, NMG SpinCo will assume responsibility for collective bargaining agreements relating to NMG service providers,
and LMG RemainCo will assume or retain responsibility for collective bargaining agreements relating to LMG service providers. Certain retirement plan
assets and liabilities relating to collective bargaining unit LMG service providers will be spun out to a retirement plan to be sponsored by LMG
RemainCo.
Treatment of Equity Awards
The Employee Matters Agreement, in conjunction with the Merger Agreement, provides for the treatment of the Company’s outstanding equity awards in
connection with the Spin-Off and Merger.
130
Table of Contents
Options. Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, each outstanding stock option granted under the Company’s equity plans
will be converted into two options: (1) an adjusted Meredith stock option that will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in
the Merger, and (2) a stock option for NMG SpinCo shares. The number of shares subject to the adjusted Meredith stock option and the NMG SpinCo
stock option will be equal to the number of shares subject to the related Meredith stock option prior to the Spin-Off, but the exercise prices will be
adjusted to reflect the value of LMG RemainCo relative to NMG SpinCo based on the trading price of Meredith Common Stock on the last trading day
immediately prior to the Distribution Date relative to the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately
prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo
Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement). The sum of the exercise prices for the adjusted Meredith stock option and the NMG SpinCo stock
option will equal the current exercise price of the related Meredith stock option prior to adjustment and the Spin-Off. The NMG SpinCo stock options will
generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the related Meredith stock option award before the Distribution, except that
unvested NMG SpinCo stock options held by LMG service providers will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from NMG
SpinCo equal to the excess, if any, of the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the
Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG SpinCo Common Stock
under the Dotdash Merger Agreement) less the adjusted exercise price for such option.
RSUs and Share-Based Awards. Prior to completion of the Merger, in connection with the Spin-Off, holders of outstanding RSUs and Share-Based
Awards granted under Meredith’s equity plans will receive RSUs and Share-Based Awards in NMG SpinCo with respect to an equal number of shares
subject to the related Meredith award prior to the Spin-Off (in addition to Merger Consideration of $16.99 in respect of every share underlying such RSUs
and Share-Based Awards). The NMG SpinCo RSUs and Share-Based Awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the
related Meredith award before the Distribution, except that unvested NMG SpinCo RSUs held by employees of LMG will be canceled and converted into
the right to receive a cash payment from NMG SpinCo equal to the “when-issued” trading price of NMG SpinCo Common Stock on the last trading day
immediately prior to the Distribution Date (or, if a “when-issued” trading price is not available, the cash amount payable in respect of each share of NMG
SpinCo Common Stock under the Dotdash Merger Agreement).
We encourage you to read the Employee Matters Agreement carefully.
The Tax Matters Agreement
The Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of the Company, Gray and NMG SpinCo with respect to taxes,
tax attributes, tax returns, tax contests and certain other tax matters in connection with the Spin-Off. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, (1) NMG
SpinCo will be liable for all pre-closing taxes of the Company and NMG SpinCo and the post-closing taxes of NMG SpinCo, and (2) Gray will be liable for
all transfer taxes imposed with respect to the Merger, all post-closing taxes of LMG RemainCo, and all taxes attributable to the station divestiture required
to obtain regulatory approvals, subject to the specific terms and conditions of the Tax Matters Agreement. Additionally, the parties agreed that NMG
SpinCo will prepare and Gray will file certain post-closing tax returns relating to pre-closing tax periods.
We encourage you to read the Tax Matters Agreement carefully.
The Transition Services Agreement
Under the Transition Services Agreement, Gray, the Company and NMG SpinCo agreed that NMG SpinCo will provide to LMG RemainCo on an interim,
transitional basis, various support services necessary for LMG RemainCo to be able to conduct business separate from the corporate functions of the
Company, which will be

infrastructure services, network security services, benefits coverage matters, leave administration, finance operations, accounting matters, broadcast

reduce the scope of any of the transition services prior to the Spin-Off, or on fifteen days’ notice during the term of the Transition Services Agreement. In
general, the services will begin on the date of the completion of the Spin-Off and will cover a period generally not expected to exceed four months

Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that Meredith provide its shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding)
basis, the compensation arrangements that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section
entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 85.
Our Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement,
and to cast a vote either to approve or disapprove, on an advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Meredith’s named
executive officers in connection with the Merger, through the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Meredith approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation to be paid by Meredith to its named
executive officers, that is based on, or otherwise relates to, its proposed acquisition by Gray Television, Inc., as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K, in the table set forth in the section of the proxy statement for the Merger entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger,” and in the related notes and narrative disclosure.”
The advisory vote on the compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart
from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote for adoption of the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the
compensation that Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger and vote not to adopt the Merger Agreement or vice
versa. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is advisory only. Because the
vote is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Meredith or Gray.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders voting, virtually or by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter,
provided there is a quorum, is required for approval of this proposal on an advisory (non-binding) basis.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for such purposes and therefore will have no effect on the results of the vote on this
proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Our Board unanimously recommends that the Meredith shareholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the resolution to approve, on an advisory (non-

If at the Special Meeting of shareholders, the number of shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock represented and voting in favor
of approval of the Merger Agreement is insufficient to adopt that proposal under the IBCA, we may move to adjourn the Special Meeting to enable our
Board to solicit additional proxies in respect of such proposal. In that event, we will ask our shareholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal,
and not the proposal regarding the adoption of the Merger Agreement or the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that
Meredith’s named executive officers may receive in connection with the Merger.
In this proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by our Board to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the
proxy or attorney-in-fact to adjourn the Special Meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the shareholders
approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time
to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from shareholders that have previously voted. Among other things, approval of the
adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the approval of the Merger
Agreement to defeat that proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of
those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Failure for this proposal to pass will not affect the ability of the holder of any proxy solicited by us to adjourn the Special Meeting in the event
insufficient shares of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock are represented to establish a quorum, or for any other lawful purpose.
Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary for the purpose of soliciting proxies requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast by shareholders voting, virtually or by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for such purposes and therefore will have no effect on the results of the vote on this
proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Our Board unanimously recommends that the Meredith shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary to permit
further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of Meredith Common Stock and Meredith Class B Stock as of September 30,
2021, at which time there were 40,729,447 shares of Meredith Common Stock and 5,061,109 shares of Meredith Class B Stock outstanding, by: (a) each
Meredith director; (b) each of Meredith’s named executive officers; (c) all Meredith named executive officers and directors as a group; and (d) all those
known by Meredith to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of the Meredith Common Stock or the Meredith Class B Stock. Meredith does not
have any class of equity securities outstanding other than its Meredith Common Stock and its Meredith Class B Stock.
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the information is not necessarily indicative of
beneficial ownership for any other purpose. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of such
person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares subject to equity awards held by the person that are currently exercisable or would vest based on
service-based vesting conditions within 60 days of September 30, 2021. However, we did not deem such shares outstanding for the purpose of computing
the percentage ownership of any other person.
The information in the table below regarding the beneficial owners of 5% or more of the Meredith Common Stock is based on our review of Schedule 13D
and Schedule 13G filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on information
available to us, that the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares they beneficially
own, subject to community property laws. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner is c/o Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust

The Meredith Common Stock is quoted on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MDP.”
The high and low sales price per share for Meredith Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg Terminal on November 5, 2021, the most recent practicable
date before the filing of this proxy statement, were $58.37 and $58.18, respectively.
As of November 5, 2021, the Meredith Common Stock was held of record by approximately 780 shareholders and the Meredith Class B Stock was held of
record by approximately 431 shareholders.
We historically declared and paid regular dividends on our capital stock but paused such dividends in 2020 as one of several actions taken to strengthen
Meredith’s liquidity and enhance Meredith’s financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently intend to retain all available funds
and any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to declare or pay cash
dividends on Meredith Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board,
subject to applicable laws, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and capital
requirements. Following the Merger, Meredith Common Stock will not be traded on any public market. If the Merger is completed, you will no longer be
eligible to receive dividends from Meredith. If the Dotdash Merger is not completed on the same day as the closing of the Spin-Off and Merger
transactions, you will be eligible to receive dividends from NMG SpinCo, to the extent NMG SpinCo declares such dividends and you continue to hold
NMG SpinCo stock pending completion of the Dotdash Merger; however, pursuant to the Dotdash Merger Agreement, NMG SpinCo is prohibited from
issuing dividends without the consent of Dotdash for so long as the Dotdash Merger Agreement remains in effect.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with a nationally recognized bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”). Prior to or as of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be
provided (i) to the Paying Agent, cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Merger Consideration for all shares of Company Stock, Non-
Employee Company Stock Options, Non-Employee Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards and Company Warrants converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof (such cash, the “Payment Fund”) and (ii) to the Company, cash in
an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Merger Consideration for all Employee Company Stock Options, Employee Company RSUs and Employee
Company Share-Based Awards. The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 2.6 out of the Payment Fund.
Except as provided in Section 2.9(g), the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
(b) Exchange Procedures.
(i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates, if applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form) and
(y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof
as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.
(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
A-18
Table of Contents
to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.6 shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock
previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.
(iii) Non-Employee Equity Awards. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of Non-Employee Company Stock Options, Non-
Employee Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards and Company Warrants a letter of transmittal. Upon the delivery of a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of record of such Non-Employee Company Stock Options, Non-Employee
Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards or Company Warrants, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Non-Employee Company Stock Options, Non-Employee Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company
Share-Based Awards or Company Warrants previously held by such holder.
(c) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in the
case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law).
(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from
the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting of
such Person of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.9(c) had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article II.
A-19
Table of Contents
(g) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Company Stock; provided, further, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying
Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required
to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.
Section 2.10 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.
Section 2.11 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.
(a) Company Stock Options. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease at the
Effective Time to represent an option with respect to shares of Common Stock, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to receive
a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (after
giving effect to the provisions of the Employee Matters Agreement), without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such
payment shall be paid (x) by the Surviving Corporation through the Paying Agent for holders of Non-Employee Company Stock Options (in respect of
Non-Employee Company Stock Options) and (y) by the Surviving Corporation to holders of Employee Company Stock Options (in respect of Employee
Company Stock Options), net of any applicable withholding Taxes, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation’s
payroll on the next administratively practicable regular payroll date but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.
(b) Company RSUs. As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically become
immediately vested, and each Company RSU shall be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a right with respect to shares of Common
Stock and shall be converted, without any action on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation a cash
payment equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock then underlying such Company RSUs multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid (x) by the Surviving Corporation
through the Paying Agent for holders of Non-Employee Company RSUs (in respect of Non-Employee Company RSUs)
A-20
Table of Contents
and (y) through the Surviving Corporation to such holders of Employee Company RSUs (in respect of Employee Company RSUs), net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll on the next administratively practicable
regular payroll date but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time.
(c) Company Share-Based Awards. As of the Effective Time, each share of the Company’s restricted stock and each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive shares of Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Common Stock granted by the
Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including stock equivalent units, phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents
and dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock Options and Company RSUs (each, other than Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, a
“Company Share-Based Award”), shall automatically become fully vested, and all vesting restrictions shall lapse, and, in exchange for the cancellation of
such Company Share-Based Award, entitle the holder of such Company Share-Based Award to a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Common Stock then underlying such Company Share-Based Award multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to all applicable withholding (the “Company Share-Based Award Payment”). The Company Share-Based Award Payment shall be
made (x) by the Surviving Corporation through the Paying Agent for holders of Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards (in respect of Non-
Employee Company Share-Based Awards) and (y) through the Surviving Corporation to such holders of Employee Company Share-Based Awards (in
respect of Employee Company Share-Based Awards), net of any applicable withholding Taxes with respect to the full amount of the Company Share-
Based Award Payment, through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll on the next administratively practicable regular payroll date (and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days) following the Effective Time.
(d) Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the Company ESPP and subject to applicable Law to (i) cause the
Company ESPP not to commence an offering period to purchase Common Stock that would otherwise begin on or after the date of this Agreement or to
accept payroll deductions with respect to any such offering period that would otherwise begin on or after the date of this Agreement to be used to
purchase Common Stock under the Company ESPP, and (ii) cause the Company ESPP to be transferred to SpinCo in the Separation in accordance with the
Employee Matters Agreement or terminated effective immediately prior to the Distribution.
(e) Certain Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and any Company Share-Based Awards as provided in this Section 2.11. SpinCo, the Company, Parent, and all other Parties will cooperate
to effectuate such payment, including by sharing any equity or employee information reasonably requested by another Party.
Section 2.12 Treatment of Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a warrant with
respect to shares of Common Stock, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Warrant to receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Company Warrant, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable
withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days following the Effective Time.
Section 2.13 Withholding. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (and any agent acting on behalf of any of them, including the Paying
Agent), as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(a) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the fully executed unredacted
debt commitment letter, together with any related fee letters (with only the fee amount, economic flex and certain other economic terms, other sensitive
numbers, and syndication levels redacted in a customary manner (none of which redacted items could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
conditionality, enforceability or termination provisions of the debt commitment letter or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Parent Financing to
be provided on the Closing Date to an aggregate amount that is less than the amount necessary, when combined with Parent’s other sources of available
funds, to pay the Merger Amounts on the Closing Date)), dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among the Parent Financing Sources named
therein and Parent providing for debt financing as described therein (together, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes, as the same may be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended or replaced from time to time in compliance with Section 7.11, the “Parent Commitment Letter”), pursuant to
which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, each of the Parent Financing Sources named therein has agreed, severally but not
jointly, to lend the amounts set forth therein. As of the date of this Agreement, the Parent Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. There are
no conditions precedent related to the funding of the amount of the Parent Financing necessary to pay the Merger Amounts on the Closing Date
contemplated by the Parent Commitment Letter, other than the conditions precedent set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter and the unredacted
portions of the related fee letters, including any applicable flex provisions thereof (such conditions precedent, the “Parent Financing Conditions”).
(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Parent Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments
contained therein have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto, and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto,
other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities who had not executed the Parent Commitment Letter as
of the date of this Agreement to the extent permitted by Section 7.11 and mandatory reductions expressly contemplated thereby. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties in this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, the completion of the Marketing Period and that the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 will be satisfied, Parent has
no reason to believe that (i) any of the Parent Financing Conditions that are in the Parent’s control will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or
(ii) the Parent Financing contemplated by the Parent Commitment Letter will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date.
(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in default or breach under the terms and conditions of the Parent Commitment Letter. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements (other than customary fee credit letters and engagement
letters) to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Parent Financing to be provided on the Closing
Date to an aggregate amount that is less than the amount necessary, when combined with Parent’s other sources of available funds, to pay the Merger
Amounts on the Closing Date, other than those set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter and the fee letters related to the Parent Commitment Letter
delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 4.9(a). Parent or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees and
amounts required by the Parent Commitment Letter to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement.
(d) Assuming (i) that the parties to the Parent Commitment Letter (other than Parent or Merger Sub) perform their obligations in accordance with the terms

Company of its
A-45

have at and as of the Closing Date sufficient available funds (when combined with the SpinCo Cash Payment and Parent’s other sources of available
funds) to satisfy all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s payment obligations under this Agreement and under the Parent Commitment Letter and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, in each case to the extent required by this Agreement and the Parent Commitment Letter to be
paid on the Closing Date as a condition precedent to the Closing or the closing and funding of the Parent Financing, the payment of the Merger
Consideration, any payments in respect of equity compensation obligations to be made in connection with the Merger, any repayment or refinancing of
any outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions
described in, this Agreement or the Parent Commitment Letter and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and
expenses of the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby (such amounts, collectively, the “Merger Amounts”). As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that the representation contained in the immediately preceding sentence will not be true at and as of the
Closing Date. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Parent Financing contemplated by the Parent
Commitment Letter) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub hereunder.

fact necessary to make such information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, not misleading in any material respect as
promptly as reasonably practicable after gaining Knowledge thereof, and Parent shall have no liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any other

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for six (6) months or if shorter, the period of employment following the Closing
Date of the relevant Employee, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Employee
with (i) base salary or other base cash compensation that are at least the same as the base salary or other base cash compensation that were provided to
such Continuing Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash incentive compensation opportunities (including short-term
annual cash incentive compensation but excluding long-term cash or equity based-compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
aggregate total cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee (but excluding long-term cash or equity-based

policies that are no less favorable than such plans, practices and policies that were applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the

similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) as soon as reasonably practical following the Closing, Parent
shall, and/or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, pay each RemainCo Employee a pro-rated cash bonus amount (based on the
number of days from July 1, 2021 through and including the Closing Date divided by 365), calculated based on such RemainCo Employee’s target annual

consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining
A-52
Table of Contents
obligations to any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in
order to comply with such obligations and that any such effort to comply with such notice, consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining
obligations shall not constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligation owed the other party.
(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, benefit accrual, and paid time off accrual (but not for benefit accruals under defined benefit
pension plans or post-retirement benefit plans or any discretionary match under the Parent or a Subsidiary’s defined contribution 401(k) plan) under the
employee benefit plans, severance arrangements, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) in which Continuing Employees may become eligible to participate in after the Closing (the “New Benefit Plans”), each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service as was credited by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under similar or
comparable Company Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable New Benefit Plans, (i) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate following the Closing, each Continuing Employee will be eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the
extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee was
participating immediately before such commencement of participation and (ii) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, for the
applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs, use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and their covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or
requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) subject to the terms and conditions of the New Benefit Plans, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company
Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such
New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan.
The Parent or an applicable Subsidiary will permit rollovers of any 401(k) plan loans and 401(k) plan accounts for Continuing Employees (and any
Employees represented by labor unions and/or covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreements who will continue service for the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, following the Closing, such individuals, the “Union Continuing Employees”) and the Parties will
cooperate to take the actions needed to provide for such rollovers, including any Company Plan or New Benefit Plan amendments.
(d) The Parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other in the exchange of information, notification to the Continuing Employees, preparation of any
documentation required to be filed with any Governmental Authority or other third party as one of them may reasonably request of the other in order to
implement this Section 6.4 and to ensure an orderly transition of employment for the Continuing Employees in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the exchange of data, documentation and any other information Parent requires (as permitted
under applicable Law) to transition the Continuing Employees and the Continuing Union Employees to the Parent payroll, benefits and other human
resources systems. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Parent (i) a true and complete list setting forth each Continuing Employee’s and each Union Continuing Employee’s unpaid or
unfulfilled deductibles, and co-payments, and any preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods that limit a Continuing Employee’s or a Union
Continuing Employee’s coverage under any Employee Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii) to the

extent permitted under applicable Law, true and complete copies of the personnel records of the Continuing Employees and Union Continuing Employees.
(e) The terms of this Section 6.4 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Continuing
Employee, Union Continuing Employees or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant or beneficiary in any Company
Plan or any other Person or Governmental Authority (whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise) other than the Parties hereto. Nothing contained
in this Section 6.4 shall (i) constitute or be deemed to constitute establishment of or an amendment to or termination of any Company Plan or other
compensation or benefit plan, policy, program, Contract or arrangement, (ii) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to retain the employment or service of (or provide any term or condition of employment or service to) any particular Employee or other
Person or (iii) prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) from amending, modifying or terminating any Company Plan,
Parent Plan, New Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, Contract or arrangement, to the extent such amendment,
modification, or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program, Contract, or arrangement.
Section 6.5 Consent Decree. Parent shall deliver to the Company an executed Acknowledgement of Applicability attached as Exhibit 2 to the Final
Judgement in United States v. Meredith Corporation Case 1:18-cv-02609 (D.D.C. May 22, 2019) before Closing, unless (i) the United States has waived the
prohibition in Paragraph IV(C) of such Final Judgment as to the Company Stations or (ii) Parent is already bound to a final judgment entered by a court
regarding the communication of competitively sensitive information, as defined in that Final Judgment.

any forum that could result in, any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to use such
reasonable best efforts, and promptly to use such reasonable best efforts to undertake the Station Divestiture (as defined in Schedule 7.1(h)) and
Approval Actions listed on Schedule 7.1(h), and (ii) the use of reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent or preliminary Order is
entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of

prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station Divestiture), any and all
steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such
actual, anticipated or threatened Order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall take the actions described in Schedule 7.1(h) in accordance with the terms thereof.

Company (the “Company Shareholders’ Meeting”) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
(v) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,

the time for which the Company Shareholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting; provided that in the case of either clause (x) or (y), the
Company Shareholders’ Meeting shall only be adjourned or postponed for a minimum period of time reasonable under the circumstances (it being
understood that any such adjournment or postponement shall not affect the Company’s obligation to hold the Company Shareholders’ Meeting as
aforesaid). The Company shall ensure that the Company Shareholders’ Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Shareholders’ Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with Section 9.1(d)(ii).

of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders’ Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board has
recommended that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Shareholders’ Meeting and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of its board of directors that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement.

Section 7.3 No Solicitation by the Company.
(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX, and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 7.3, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
not authorize or permit and use reasonable best efforts to cause any of its officers, directors, employees or Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or continue in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or afford access to its
business, properties, assets, books or records to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective representatives), in connection with any
inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend, or make any public statement approving, endorsing or recommending, a Company Acquisition Proposal or, subject to Section 7.3(e), effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (iv) enter into any letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement providing for a Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each an “Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement”), (v) submit any
Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the shareholders of the Company or (vi) authorize, commit, resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(a) or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to the time the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives an unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal not resulting, in whole or in part, from a breach
of this Section 7.3, that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, (i) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal and (ii) failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such Company
Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group (or any of their Representatives
or potential financing sources) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group and
their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that (x) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with the Person or group making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) promptly (but not more than two (2) Business Days) after
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposal solely to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal and (B) inform a Person or group that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making, a Company
Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this Section 7.3.
(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent in writing after receipt of any Company Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the proposal, request or offer, the material terms and conditions of any such
proposal, request or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any such proposal, request or offer (including
any material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof), but in no event later than one (1) Business
Day after any such material change.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its Representatives to, immediately (i) cease any existing discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) terminate access for any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) to the Data Room and (iii) request the return or destruction of any non-public information provided to any Person (other
than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) in connection with a potential Company Acquisition Proposal who has received access to
information within the past twelve months. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to enforce its rights
under the provisions of any “standstill” agreement between the Company and any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification to, any such agreement, to permit such Person to submit a
Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a Person to orally request the waiver of a
“standstill” or similar obligation or from granting such a waiver, in each case, to the extent the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day thereafter) notifies Parent thereof
(including the identity of such counterparty) of such waiver or release.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board
may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this
Agreement and that did not result from a material breach of this Section 7.3, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) and concurrently pay
the fee required by Section 9.3 in order to enter into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Company Proposal) if: (i)(A) a Company
Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn prior to such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) there has been an Intervening Event; (ii) in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; and (iii) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws.
(f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, (i) the Company
Board shall provide Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in
reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and
attaching a copy of any proposed agreements for the Superior Company Proposal, if applicable, it being understood that the delivery of such notice shall
not itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) during the four (4) Business Days following such written notice, the Company
Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, as would
enable the Company Board to maintain the Company Board Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case
of a Superior Company Proposal, terminate this Agreement; and (iii) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii),
the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and
taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws.
(g) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to their shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
A-60
Table of Contents
or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any legally required
disclosure to its shareholders required pursuant to applicable Law if the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law; provided,
however, that this Section 7.3(g) shall not permit the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent
otherwise permitted by this Section 7.3. For the avoidance of doubt, any “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Section 7.4 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall share their respective initial press releases with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby with each other and such releases shall be subject to consent of the other party. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public statement
relating to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading
market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event
such Party shall provide, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, an opportunity to the other Party to review and comment on such press release
or other announcement in advance, and shall give reasonable consideration to all reasonable comments suggested thereto. None of the limitations set
forth in this Section 7.4 shall apply to any disclosure of any information (a) in connection with or following a Company Acquisition Proposal or Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and matters related thereto pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and condition of this Agreement, (b) in
connection with any dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) consistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Section 7.4, (d) that is not confidential
information of any other Party with financial analysts, investors and media representatives in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent
with its past practice in compliance with applicable Laws or (e) in the case of the Company, as reasonably necessary for the Company to effect the
redemption of the Company Notes as contemplated in Section 7.13(a).
Section 7.5 Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any material written
notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority or securities exchange in
connection with the Separation, the Distribution or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) any Proceeding or
investigation, commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, that would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, or (d) the occurrence of any effect, event, change,
occurrence or circumstance which would or would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, or (iii) result in an
inaccuracy of any of its own representations or warranties in a manner that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as
applicable, not to be satisfied at the Closing.
Section 7.6 Access to Information.
(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX, upon reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, to all of its and its Subsidiaries’ properties, books, Contracts,
A-61
Table of Contents
commitments, records, assets, officers and employees and, during such period the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to Parent all
other information concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective businesses, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request;
provided that the Company may restrict the foregoing access and the disclosure of information to the extent that, in its good faith judgment, (i) any Law
applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information,
(ii) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, (iii) disclosure of any such information or document could result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege, (iv) such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) such information is
primarily related to the SpinCo Entities, SpinCo Assets, SpinCo Liabilities or the SpinCo Business. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.
(b) Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to (i) within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, engage an environmental
consulting firm to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and Compliance Review, as such terms are commonly understood (the “Phase I
Environmental Assessment”), and (ii) order a Phase II environmental review or any other test, investigation or review recommended in the Phase I
Environmental Assessment (provided Company and Parent reasonably agree with such recommendation); provided, that such environmental
assessment, test, investigation or review shall be conducted only (w) during regular business hours, (x) with no less than two (2) Business Days’ prior
written notice to the Company, (y) in a manner which will not unduly interfere with the operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the use of access
to or egress from any real property and (z) with respect to leased real property, shall only be done if the owner of such property consents. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to undertake to obtain such consents as promptly as practicable if requested by Parent. Completion of any
environmental assessments (or the results thereof) is not a condition for the Closing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
remediate any environmental condition that is identified in any such assessment in respect of Owned Real Property at its sole cost and expense prior to
Closing if such condition requires current remediation under applicable Environmental Law; provided, however, that the completion of any such
remediation shall not be a condition to Closing. If the Company and Parent do not agree that such condition requires current remediation under applicable
Environmental Law, Company and Parent shall cooperate in resolving such disagreement and designate an independent, nationally-recognized
environmental expert to resolve such disagreement as soon as reasonably practicable. Any such remediation shall only be required to meet the most cost
effective standard and execute in a reasonable manner, in each case to become compliant with any applicable Environmental Laws.
(c) Parent may obtain, if it so elects at its sole option and expense, (a) commitments for owner’s and lender’s title insurance policies on the Owned Real
Property and commitments for lessee’s and lender’s title insurance policies for all real property that is leased pursuant to a Real Property Lease
(collectively, the “Title Commitments”), and (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of real property (the “Surveys”); provided, however, that the Company
shall provide Parent with any existing Title Commitments, title policies and Surveys reasonably available in its possession or control to the extent not
previously provided by the Company in the Data Room. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in obtaining such Title Commitments and
Surveys, provided, the Company shall not be required to incur any cost, expense or other liability in connection therewith and Parent shall reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. If the Title Commitments or Surveys reveal any Lien on the title or real property other than Permitted Liens, Parent
shall notify the Company in writing of such objectionable Lien promptly after Parent becomes aware that such matter is not a Permitted Lien, and the
Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such objectionable Lien; provided that the removal of such objectionable Lien shall
not be a condition to the Closing.
(d) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 7.6(a), Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its Representatives to comply with, all
of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 7.7 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreements by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
Common Stock and other securities of RemainCo under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is brought against such Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors and shall
keep the other Party informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof.
Section 7.10 Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is
or becomes applicable to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any
of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Separation, Distribution and Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of
such Takeover Statute on the Separation, Distribution and Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Section 7.11 Parent Financing and Financing Cooperation.
(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Parent Financing or any Parent Substitute Debt Financing (as defined
below) on the terms and conditions specified in the Parent Commitment Letter as the same may be modified or amended pursuant to the flex provisions of
the related fee letters and any other amendment, waiver, supplement or modification thereof permitted by this Section 7.11 (and, in any event, no later than
the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.3), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)(A) maintain in effect the
Parent Commitment Letter and, subject to compliance by the Company of its covenants and agreements hereunder, comply with all of their respective
covenants and obligations thereunder, (B) negotiate and, assuming all conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 hereof have been
satisfied and taking into account the Marketing Period, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Parent Financing reflecting the
terms and conditions contained in the Parent Commitment Letter, so that such agreements are in effect no later than the time at which the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to Section 2.3 and (C) upon, and subject to, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, the
completion of the Marketing Period and the satisfaction of the other Parent Financing Conditions, enforce their rights under the Parent Commitment
Letter and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all the Parent Financing Conditions that are in Parent’s (or its Subsidiaries’) control. In the event that all conditions
set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, the Marketing Period has been completed, and the
Closing should otherwise occur pursuant to Section 2.3, Parent and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing
the Parent Financing (the “Parent Debt Financing Parties”) to fund the Parent Financing at the Effective Time.
(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of the Parent Financing and material developments with respect to
the Parent Financing. Without limiting the foregoing,
A-63
Table of Contents
Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day) after obtaining Knowledge thereof, give the Company written notice (i) of any
breach or default by Parent, its Affiliates, the Parent Debt Financing Parties or any other party to the Parent Commitment Letter or any definitive
document related to the Parent Financing (or any event or circumstance, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would give rise to any breach or
default), (ii) of any threatened or actual withdrawal, repudiation, expiration, intention not to fund or termination of or relating to the Parent Commitment
Letter or the Parent Financing, (iii) of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Parent Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Parent Financing (other than ordinary course of business negotiations) or (iv) if for any reason Parent in good faith no
longer believes it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Parent Financing in an amount necessary, when combined with Parent’s other sources of
available funds, to consummate the Merger. Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Parent Commitment Letter
without the approval of the Company; provided that Parent shall not, without the Company’s prior written consent, permit any such amendment,
modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Parent
Commitment Letter (other than modifications or amendments contemplated by the flex provisions of the related fee letters) which would (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Parent Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) to an amount that is less than
the amount necessary, when combined with Parent’s other sources of available funds, to consummate the Merger and pay the Merger Amounts on the
Closing Date, (B) impose new or additional conditions to the Parent Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Parent
Financing or (C) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Parent Commitment Letter or the Parent Financing in a manner that in the
case of this clause (C) would reasonably be expected to (I) delay, prevent or make less likely the consummation of the Merger or the funding of the Parent
Financing in an amount necessary to consummate the Merger and pay the Merger Amounts on the Closing Date (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Parent Financing) at the Effective Time, (II) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Parent Debt Financing Parties or any
other parties to the Parent Commitment Letter to cause the portion of the Parent Financing that is necessary to consummate the Merger to be funded or
(III) adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, further, that the
Parent Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified to add additional Parent Financing Sources who are not parties to the
Parent Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or reduce the aggregate amount of the Parent Financing by the amount of any debt financing, the terms of
which comply with clauses (B) and (C) above (any such financing, a “Parent Permanent Financing”). In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee
letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Parent Commitment Letter permitted
pursuant to this Section 7.11(b), such new commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the “Parent Financing” and deemed to be
the “Parent Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day) deliver to
the Company true, correct and complete copies of any termination, amendment, modification or replacement of the Parent Commitment Letter. If funds in
the amounts set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter that are necessary to consummate the Merger and pay the Merger Amounts on the Closing Date,
or any portion thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, (x) notify the Company in writing thereof, (y) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute debt financing sufficient to enable
Parent to consummate the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including payment of the other Merger Amounts) in accordance with the terms hereof (the “Parent Substitute Debt Financing”) on terms and
conditions that are not less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Parent Commitment
Letter and (z) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such Parent Substitute Debt
Financing and, promptly after execution thereof (and, in any event, no later than one (1) Business Day), deliver to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (redacted in a similar manner as described in Section 4.9 hereof) with respect to such Parent
Substitute Debt Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Parent Substitute Debt Financing or any Parent Permanent Financing, such
financing shall be deemed to be a part of the “Parent Financing” and any commitment letter for such Parent Substitute Debt Financing shall be deemed
the “Parent Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement.

Parent Commitment Letter that are required to have been paid at or prior to the Effective Time.
(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parent’s
nor Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Parent Financing, any Parent Substitute
Debt Financing or any other financing.
(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to,
provide to Parent such customary cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in causing the conditions and covenants related to the Parent
Financing to be satisfied and to assist Parent in obtaining the Parent Financing, including:
(i) Using reasonable best efforts in assisting in preparation for and participation in (including causing senior management of appropriate seniority and

representation that (to the extent accurate) the public-side version does not include material non-public information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries or their respective securities and (B) customary materials for rating agency presentations for the Parent Financing (all of the items in this
clause (ii), collectively, the “Offering Materials”);

required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act to be included in a registration statement filed with the SEC by the Parent all of

new commitment letter and the related fee letters (redacted in a similar manner as described in Section 3.23(a) hereof) with respect to such SpinCo
Alternate Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such SpinCo Alternate Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
“SpinCo Financing” and any commitment letter for such SpinCo Alternate Financing shall be deemed the “SpinCo Financing Commitment Letter” for all

officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such Party), other than the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 9.2, Section 9.3, and Article X,
which provisions shall survive such termination; provided, however, that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.11(e), Section 9.3 and Section
10.12, nothing in this first sentence of Section 9.2 shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth in Section 9.3. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where (i) the
Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company to Parent or (ii) the Parent Termination Fee is payable by Parent to the Company, if such amount
referenced in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii), as the case may be, is paid in full, the receipt of such amount by the receiving party shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the receiving party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and such party (A) shall be
precluded from any other remedy against any other party hereto, at law or in equity or otherwise and (B) shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment,
or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against any of the other parties hereto, any of their respective

Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of this Agreement (including any
Willful Breach but excluding fraud). Each party acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion nor shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each party
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (iii) the Parent
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iv) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, (i) if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 9.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any

Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made (or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law); and (ii) if Parent
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a

pursuant to this Section 9.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at an annual rate equal to the prime lending

by applicable Law). All payments under this Section 9.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Parent or the Company, as applicable. In no event shall a Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee be payable more than once.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to Section 10.12, (i) in the event that this Agreement is terminated under

of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and

any schedule, certificate, instrument or other document
A-76
Table of Contents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the Effective Time or, except as provided in Section 5.3, Section 9.2 and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, as the case may be. This Section 10.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time, which covenants will survive until they are performed in full.
Section 10.2 Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects
by written agreement of the Parties at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided that after the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, no amendment that requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law shall be made without such
required further approval. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.2 or Section 10.3 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, action by their respective board of
directors (or a committee thereof), as applicable. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, this Section 10.2, Section 10.3, Section 10.8, the first sentence
of Section 10.10, Section 10.11(b), Section 10.12(c), Section 10.13 and Section 10.14 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any such Section, and any related definitions insofar as they affect
such Sections) shall not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in a manner that is adverse to the interests of any (a) Parent Financing Source party
to the Parent Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of such Parent Financing Source or (b) SpinCo Lender party to the SpinCo Financing
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of such SpinCo Lender.
Section 10.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, Parent or Merger Sub on the one hand, or the Company

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other Parties or (c)
subject to the proviso of the first sentence of Section 10.2, waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor
shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall act on behalf of Merger Sub and the Company may rely on any notice
given by Parent on behalf of Merger Sub with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 10.3. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, Section 10.2,
this Section 10.3, Section 10.8, the first sentence of Section 10.10, Section 10.11(b), Section 10.12(c), Section 10.13 and Section 10.14 (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance of any such Section) shall not be waived in a manner that is adverse

Source or (b) SpinCo Lender party to the SpinCo Financing Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of such SpinCo Lender.
Section 10.4 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such cost or expense; provided, however, that prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement by the Company and the RemainCo Subsidiaries that remain unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to be paid by SpinCo
(and provide Parent with evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, prior to Closing, of such arrangements), and, provided, further, that filing fees in
connection with the filing by the Parties of the FCC Applications and the HSR Act shall be split between 50/50 Parent and the Company (other than the
FCC Application filing fees related to the Station Divestiture which shall be paid by Parent), and, to the extent any such amounts to be paid by the
Company are not paid by the Effective Time or assumed by SpinCo, the Target Net Debt shall be reduced by an amount equal to such unpaid amounts.
Section 10.5 Disclosure Letter References. All capitalized terms not defined in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter (as applicable,
the “Disclosure Letter”) shall have the meanings assigned to

them in this Agreement. The Disclosure Letter shall, for all purposes in this Agreement, be arranged in numbered and lettered parts and subparts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement. Each item disclosed in the Disclosure Letter shall
constitute an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of, the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it
makes express reference and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth for the purposes of every other part in the Disclosure Letter relating to the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) set forth in this Agreement to the extent a cross-reference within the Disclosure Letter is
expressly made to such other part in the Disclosure Letter, as well as to the extent that the relevance of such item as an exception to or, as applicable,
disclosure for purposes of, such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, for purposes of determining any exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of this Agreement
or the disclosure of any matters on the Company Disclosure Letter, the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of this Agreement (other
than Section 3.10(a)) shall be deemed not to include any reference therein to “Company Material Adverse Effect” and, in place of the “Material Adverse
Effect” qualifier, such representations and warranties shall be qualified by “material” or “materially”, as applicable. The listing of any matter on the
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or Parent, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material, is required to be disclosed by the Company or Parent, as applicable, under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever and the inclusion of an
item relating to the SpinCo Business, SpinCo Assets or SpinCo Liabilities does not, in and of itself, establish that such item relates to or affects RemainCo
or the RemainCo Business (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement). No disclosure in the
Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Disclosure
Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

10.13 and Section 10.14.
Section 10.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a
whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Section 10.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void; provided that this Agreement (including the rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement) may be assigned by
Parent to any of the Parent Financing Sources as collateral for the purpose of securing obligations under the Parent Financing. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

(C) Section 7.3(c) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
“The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent in writing after receipt of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or could reasonably be

AA-1Table of Contents
material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof), and shall provide to Parent all

material change.”
(D) Section 7.3(f) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
“Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, (i) the
Company Board shall provide Parent at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall specify, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, and attaching a copy of any proposed agreements for the Superior Company Proposal, if applicable, it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) during the five (5)
Business Days following such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, as would enable the Company Board to maintain the
Company Board Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior Company
Proposal, terminate this Agreement; and (iii) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the
Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as
applicable (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to
warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.”
(E) Section 9.2 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
“In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination

Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such Party), other than the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 9.2,
Section 9.3, and Article X, which provisions shall survive such termination; provided, however, that, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 7.11(e), Section 9.3 and Section 10.12, nothing in this first sentence of Section 9.2 shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth in Section 9.3. No termination
of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto agree that, upon
any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where (i) the Company Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee is
payable by the Company to Parent or (ii) the Parent Termination Fee is payable by Parent to the Company, if such amount referenced in the
foregoing clause (i) or (ii), as the case may be, is paid in full, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a)(i), the receipt of such
amount by the receiving party shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and such party (A) shall be precluded from any other remedy against any other party hereto, at law or in
equity or otherwise and (B) shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, against any of the other parties hereto, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of this Agreement (including any Willful Breach but excluding fraud). Each
party acknowledges and
AA-2
Table of Contents
agrees that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee on
more than one occasion (except, for the avoidance of doubt, as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a)(i)) nor shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other parties
would not enter into this Agreement.”
(F) Section 9.3(a)(i) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
“In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i), or in the event that this Agreement is terminated

funds, a fee in the amount of $113,000,000 at or prior to the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(ii) or as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination) in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) (the “Company Termination Fee”), or (B) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) if,
at the time of such termination, (1) each of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 (other than the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(e)) and
Section 8.3, other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions at Closing, has been satisfied or waived, and (2)

Separation and Distribution Agreement, other than the conditions set forth in Section 3.3(d) and Section 3.3(e) of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, has been satisfied or waived, then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, a fee in the amount of $73,000,000 as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such
termination) (the “Financing Failure Termination Fee”). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will both a Company Termination Fee and a
Financing Failure Termination Fee be payable in connection with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event a
Financing Failure Termination Fee is actually paid, a Company Termination Fee (net of any Financing Failure Termination Fee previously
paid) may become payable pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii).”
(G) Section 9.3(a)(ii) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
“In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or Section 9.1(b)(iii), or in the event
that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) in respect of a Willful Breach by the Company of a covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, and in each case at any time after the date of this Agreement prior to such termination (A) a
Company Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company and publicly announced or otherwise disclosed and has not been
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement (or (I) prior to the Company Shareholders’ Meeting in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) or (II) prior to the applicable breach giving rise to the termination right in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 9.1(c)(ii)) and provided that the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders’
Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof)) and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company (x)
enters into an agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such Company Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated or (y) consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the Company Termination Fee, less the amount of any Parent Expenses, or the Financing Failure
Termination Fee, as applicable, previously paid by the Company, concurrently with the consummation of such transaction arising from such
Company Acquisition Proposal (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such consummation); provided, however, that
for purposes of the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” in this Section 9.3(a)(ii), references to “20%” and “80%” shall be
replaced by “50%”.”

expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, (iii) the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the

Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iv) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into

under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 9.3,

executed amended and restated debt commitment letter and associated fee letters dated the date hereof (with only the fee amount, economic flex,

Ladies & Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Common

“Excluded Holders” refers to E.T. Meredith, IV and D. Mell Meredith Frazier, who are party to the Support Agreement (as defined below) (the “Supporting
Stockholders”), Acquiror, Acquisition Sub, any other subsidiary of the Acquiror, the Company and any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the
Company; (ii) reviewed certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company

referred to as the “Financial Forecasts”); (iii) reviewed certain information regarding the capitalization of the Company provided by management of the
Company; (iv) conducted discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company concerning the information
described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, as well as the business and prospects of the Company generally; (v) reviewed publicly available
financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of business that we deemed relevant; (vi) reviewed the financial terms of certain other
transactions that we deemed relevant; (vii) reviewed (A) a draft of each of (a) the Agreement, dated May 3, 2021, (b) the Separation and Distribution

B-1Table of Contents
In connection with our review, we have, with your consent, relied on the information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by us for purposes of this
opinion being complete and accurate in all material respects. We have not assumed any responsibility for independent verification of (and have not
independently verified) any of such information. With your consent, we have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the
Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. With respect to the Financial
Forecasts referred to above, we have assumed, at your direction, that they have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future performance of the Company. We express no views as to the
reasonableness of the Financial Forecasts or any other financial forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, with your consent,
we have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of
the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With your consent, we have assumed for purposes of our analysis and
opinion that the economic rights of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock are identical. Our analysis and opinion do not address the non-economic
rights of any such shares (including voting rights), and, at your direction, we have not attempted to place any financial value on any such non-economic
rights. We express no view as to the allocation of Consideration between the Common Stock and the Class B Stock.
Our opinion does not address the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared
to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company and does not address any legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting matters. At your direction, we have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Agreement or the Support
Agreement or any aspect or implication of the Transaction, except for the fairness of the Consideration from a financial point of view to the holders of
Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Holders). We are not expressing any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of the Company following
the closing of the Transaction. In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that the final executed form of the Agreement will not
differ in any material respect from the draft that we have reviewed, that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with its terms without any
waiver or modification that could be material to our analysis, and that the parties to the Agreement will comply with all the material terms of the
Agreement. Our opinion does not address the Separation, Distribution, SpinCo Cash Payment and the other transactions contemplated by the Separation
Agreement, and we have assumed, with your consent, that such transactions are completed as described to us, except to the extent that could not be
material to our analysis. We have assumed, with your consent, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary for the
completion of the Transaction will be obtained, except to the extent that could not be material to our analysis.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to update this opinion for developments after the date hereof.
We have acted as your financial advisor in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, the principal portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. We will also receive a fee upon delivery of this opinion. Our affiliates, employees, officers and
partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of the Company and the Acquiror. We have provided investment banking and other services to
the Company unrelated to the Transaction and in the future may provide such services and have received and may receive compensation for such
services. In the past two years prior to the date hereof, we acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with a divestiture.
This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Transaction. This
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of securities should vote or act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.
This opinion does not address the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or

relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, other than the fairness of the Consideration from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Holders). In addition, we do not express any opinion as to the
fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Transaction, or any
class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. This opinion was approved by a Moelis & Company LLC fairness opinion committee.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common
Stock in the Transaction is fair from a financial point of view to such holders, other than the Excluded Holders.
Very truly yours,

in the notice pursuant to section 490.1322, subsection 2, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (2). In addition, if applicable, the shareholder must certify on the
form whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice
pursuant to section 490.1322, subsection 2, paragraph “a”. If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the
shareholder’s shares as after-acquired shares under section 490.1325. In addition, a shareholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must execute and
return the form and, in a case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder’s certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred

or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws
pursuant to subsection 2.
2. A shareholder who has complied with subsection 1 may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so
notifying the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to section 490.1322, subsection 2, paragraph “b”, subparagraph
(5). A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the appraisal process shall not thereafter withdraw without the corporation’s written consent.
3. A shareholder who does not sign and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder’s share certificates where required,
each by the date set forth in the notice described in section 490.1322, subsection 2, shall not be entitled to payment under this subchapter.
490.1324 Payment.
1. Except as provided in section 490.1325, within thirty days after the form required section 490.1322, subsection 2, paragraph “b”, subparagraph (2), is
due, the corporation shall pay in cash to those shareholders who complied with section 490.1323, subsection 1, the amount the corporation estimates to
be the fair value of their shares, plus interest.
2. The payment to each shareholder pursuant to subsection 1 must be accompanied by all of the following:

which shall be of a date ending not more than sixteen months before the date of payment and shall comply with section 490.1620,
subsection 2; provided that, if such annual financial statements are not reasonably available, the corporation shall provide reasonably
equivalent financial information.

ownership of all of the shareholder’s shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before the date set forth in the appraisal notice sent
pursuant to section 490.1322, subsection 2, paragraph “a”.
2. If the corporation elects to withhold payment under subsection 1, it must within thirty days after the form required by section 490.1322, subsection 2,

subsection 2, paragraph “b”, to each shareholder who agreed to accept the corporation’s offer in full satisfaction of the shareholder’s demand.

1. A shareholder paid pursuant to section 490.1324 who is dissatisfied with the amount of the payment must notify the corporation in writing of that
shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of the shares and demand payment of that estimate plus interest, less any payment under section 490.1324. A
shareholder offered payment under section 490.1325 who is dissatisfied with that offer must reject the offer and demand payment of the shareholder’s
stated estimate of the fair value of the shares plus interest.
2. A shareholder who fails to notify the corporation in writing of that shareholder’s demand to be paid the shareholder’s stated estimate of the fair value
plus interest under subsection 1 within thirty days after receiving the corporation’s payment or offer of payment under section 490.1324 or 490.1325,
respectively, waives the right to demand payment under this section and shall be entitled only to the payment made or offered pursuant to those
respective sections.

2. The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the district court of the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none, its registered
office, in this state is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the
county in this state where the principal office or registered office of the domestic corporation merged with the foreign corporation was located at the time
of the transaction.
3. The corporation shall make all shareholders, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled, parties to the proceeding as in an
action against their shares and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by

order appointing them, or in any amendment to it. The shareholders demanding appraisal rights are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in
other civil proceedings. There shall be no right to a jury trial.
5. Each shareholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for either of the following:
a. The amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the shareholder’s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation
to the shareholder for such shares.
b. The fair value, plus interest, of the shareholder’s shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under section 490.1325.
490.1331 Court costs and expenses.
1. The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under section 490.1330 shall determine all court costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable
compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the court costs against the corporation, except that the court
may assess court costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds
such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this subchapter.
2. The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the expenses for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable, for any of the
following:
a. Against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially
comply with the requirements of section 490.1320, 490.1322, 490.1324, or 490.1325.
b. Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom
the expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.
3. If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the expenses incurred by any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly
situated, and that such expenses should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that such expenses be paid out of the amounts
awarded the shareholders who were benefited.
4. To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to section 490.1324, 490.1325, or 490.1326, the shareholder may sue directly for
the amount owed and, to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation expenses of the suit.

2.5 Transfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities from and After the Time of Distribution.
(a) To the extent any RemainCo Asset is transferred or assigned to, or any RemainCo Liability is assumed by, a member of the SpinCo Group at the Time
of Distribution or is owned or held by a member of the SpinCo Group after the Time of Distribution, and to the extent any SpinCo Asset (including any
funds to be transferred pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(vi)) is not transferred or assigned to, or any SpinCo Liability is not assumed by, a member of the
SpinCo Group at the Time of Distribution or is owned or held by a member of the RemainCo Group after the Time of Distribution, from and after the Time
of Distribution:
(i) SpinCo or the Company, as applicable, shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the
other party or certain of its Subsidiaries designated by such party, and SpinCo or the Company, or such Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall accept
from the Company or SpinCo and such applicable Subsidiaries, all of the Company’s or SpinCo’s or such Subsidiaries’ respective right, title and
interest in and to such RemainCo Assets or SpinCo Assets; and
(ii) The Company or SpinCo, as applicable, or certain Subsidiaries of the Company or SpinCo designated by such party, shall promptly accept,
assume and agree faithfully to perform, discharge and fulfill all such RemainCo Liabilities or SpinCo Liabilities in accordance with their respective
terms.
(b) In furtherance of the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of Assets and the assumption of Liabilities set forth in this Section 2.5, and
without any additional consideration therefor: (A) the applicable party shall execute and deliver, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver,
such bills of sale, quitclaim deeds, stock powers, certificates of title, assignments of contracts and other instruments of transfer, conveyance and
assignment as and to the extent necessary to evidence the transfer, conveyance and assignment of all of such party’s and its Subsidiaries’ right, title and
interest in and to the applicable Assets to the other party and its Subsidiaries, and (B) the applicable party shall execute and deliver such assumptions of
contracts and other instruments of assumption as and to the extent necessary to evidence the valid and effective assumption of the applicable Liabilities
by such party.
2.6 Approvals and Notifications.
(a) From and after the Time of Distribution, to the extent that the transfer or assignment of any Asset, the assumption of any Liability, the Separation or
the Distribution requires any Approvals or Notifications (the “Required Approvals”), the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain or make
such Approvals or Notifications as soon as reasonably practicable.
(b) If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or assignment of any Assets or assumption of any Liabilities would be a violation of
applicable Law or require any Approvals or Notifications in connection with the Separation, or the Distribution, that has not been obtained or made by
the Time of Distribution then, unless the parties hereto mutually shall otherwise determine, the transfer or assignment of such Assets or the assumption
of such Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null
and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such Approvals or Notifications have been obtained or made.
(c) If any transfer or assignment of any Asset or any assumption of any Liability intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed hereunder, as the case
may be, is not consummated on or prior to the Distribution Date, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 2.6(b) or for any other reason, then,
insofar as reasonably possible, the party shall, or shall cause its Affiliates retaining such Asset or such Liability to, as the case may be, thereafter hold
such Asset or Liability, as the case may be, for the use and benefit of the Person entitled thereto (at the expense of such Person entitled thereto) until
such Asset or Liability is transferred to the Person entitled thereto. In addition, for such period, the party or the Affiliate of a party retaining such Asset
or such Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Asset or Liability in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Person to whom such Asset is to be
transferred or assigned, or which will assume such Liability, as the case may be, in order to place such Person in a substantially similar position as if
D-15
Table of Contents
such Asset or Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such
Asset or Liability, as the case may be, including use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Asset or Liability, as
the case may be, is to inure from and after the Time of Distribution to such Person.
(d) If and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer or assignment of any Asset or the deferral of
assumption of any Liability pursuant to Section 2.6(b), are obtained or made, and, if and when any other legal impediments for the transfer or assignment
of any Asset or the assumption of any Liability have been removed, the transfer or assignment of the applicable Asset or the assumption of the
applicable Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and/or the applicable
Transaction Document.
(e) Any Person retaining an Asset or Liability due to the deferral of the transfer or assignment of such Asset or the deferral of the assumption of such
Liability, as the case may be, shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing and unless the parties have executed documentation providing for
such asset or liability to be retained by such party pursuant to Section 2.6(b), to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced (or
otherwise made available) by the Person entitled to the Asset or Liability, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys’ fees and recording or
similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by such party entitled to such Asset or Liability.
2.7 Responsibility for Liabilities. If the Company or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval,
amendment or release required to transfer a Liability to the other party or its Affiliates as required by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
the applicable party shall or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, continue to be bound by such agreement, lease, license or other obligation or Liability
and, unless not permitted by the terms thereof or by Law, the other party shall, as agent or subcontractor for such party, as the case may be, pay, perform
and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such party thereunder from and after the Time of Distribution. The party required to assume
such Liability pursuant to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents shall indemnify the other party, and hold the other party and its Group
harmless, against any Liabilities arising in connection therewith; provided, that pursuant hereto the party required to assume such Liability pursuant to
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents shall have no obligation to indemnify any party that has engaged in any knowing and intentional
violation of Law, breach of contract, tort, fraud or misrepresentation in connection therewith after the Effective Time. The Indemnified Party shall cause
each member of its Group without further consideration, to pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to the other party, promptly all money, rights
and other consideration received by it or any member of its Group in respect of such performance (unless any such consideration is an Asset of such
Group). If and when any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release shall be obtained or the obligations under such agreement, lease,
license or other obligations or Liabilities shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, the Indemnified Party shall promptly assign, or cause
to be assigned, all its obligations and other Liabilities thereunder or any obligations of any member of its Group to the other party without payment of
further consideration and such other party shall, without the payment of any further consideration, assume such obligations in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and/or the applicable Transaction Document.
2.8 Shared Contracts. The parties shall, and shall cause the members of their respective Groups to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to work
together (and, if necessary and desirable, to work with the third party to such Shared Contract) in an effort to divide, partially assign, modify and/or
replicate (in whole or in part) the respective rights and obligations under and in respect of any Shared Contract, such that (a) a member of the RemainCo
Group is the beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the obligations related to that portion of such Shared Contract relating to the RemainCo
Business (the “RemainCo Portion”), which rights shall be a RemainCo Asset and which obligations relating to the RemainCo Business shall be a
RemainCo Liability and (b) a member of the SpinCo Group is the beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the obligations related to such Shared
Contract not relating to the RemainCo Business (the “SpinCo Portion”), which rights shall be a SpinCo Asset and which obligations shall be a SpinCo
Liability. If the parties, or their respective Group
D-16
Table of Contents
members, as applicable, are not able to enter into an arrangement to formally divide, partially assign, modify and/or replicate such Shared Contract prior to
the Distribution as contemplated by the previous sentence, then the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Group members to, cooperate in any
lawful arrangement to provide that, following the Distribution and until the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of the Distribution Date (or the expiration
date of the underlying contract, if longer) and (y) such time as the formal division, partial assignment, modification and/or replication of such Shared
Contract as contemplated by the previous sentence is effected, a member of the RemainCo Group shall receive the interest in the benefits and obligations
of the RemainCo Portion under such Shared Contract and a member of the SpinCo Group shall receive the interest in the benefits and obligations of the
SpinCo Portion under such Shared Contract.
2.9 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE
REMAINCO GROUP) AND SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE SPINCO GROUP) UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT,

THE SPINCO BUSINESS, AS TO ANY APPROVALS OR NOTIFICATIONS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH, AS TO THE
VALUE OR FREEDOM FROM ANY SECURITY INTERESTS OF, OR ANY OTHER MATTER CONCERNING, ANY ASSETS OF SUCH PARTY, OR AS TO
THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFENSES OR RIGHT OF SETOFF OR FREEDOM FROM COUNTERCLAIM WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR OTHER
ASSET, INCLUDING ANY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OF ANY PARTY, OR AS TO THE LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF ANY ASSIGNMENT, DOCUMENT,
CERTIFICATE OR INSTRUMENT DELIVERED HEREUNDER TO CONVEY TITLE TO ANY ASSET OR THING OF VALUE UPON THE EXECUTION,
DELIVERY AND FILING HEREOF OR THEREOF. EXCEPT AS MAY EXPRESSLY BE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, ALL SUCH ASSETS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED ON AN “AS IS,” “WHERE IS” BASIS (AND, IN THE CASE OF ANY
REAL PROPERTY, BY MEANS OF A QUITCLAIM OR SIMILAR FORM DEED OR CONVEYANCE) AND THE RESPECTIVE TRANSFEREES SHALL
BEAR THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL RISKS THAT (I) ANY CONVEYANCE SHALL PROVE TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO VEST IN THE TRANSFEREE
GOOD TITLE, FREE AND CLEAR OF ANY SECURITY INTEREST, AND (II) ANY NECESSARY APPROVALS OR NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT
OBTAINED OR MADE OR THAT ANY REQUIREMENTS OF LAWS OR JUDGMENTS ARE NOT COMPLIED WITH.

practicable after written request therefor, any Information in the possession or under the control of such respective Group which the requesting party
reasonably needs for a reasonable business purpose; provided, however, that in the event that any party determines that any such provision of
Information could be commercially detrimental, competitively sensitive, violate any Law or agreement (including any confidentiality provisions contained

obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. For the avoidance of doubt, SpinCo and the Company shall be permitted to retain
copies or originals, as the case may be, of all documents relating to the SpinCo Business and the RemainCo Business, respectively.

either party prior to the Distribution Date) or such other policies or practices as may be reasonably adopted by, or are in effect for, the appropriate party
after the Time of Distribution until such Information is seven (7) years old or until such later date as may be required by applicable Law. For the avoidance
of doubt, from and after the Effective Time, the policies or practices applicable to any Information in the possession or control of the RemainCo Entities
shall be the policies and practices of Parent.

penalties shall not include any Liabilities asserted in connection with the claims underlying the applicable Action, other than fines or penalties resulting
from any claim of spoliation) as a result of such other party’s inability to produce Information caused by such inadvertent failure and, notwithstanding
Section 5.2 and Section 5.3, shall not be liable to such other party for any other Liabilities.
4.5 Liability. No party shall have any liability to any other party in the event that any Information exchanged or provided pursuant to this Agreement
which is an estimate or forecast, or which is based on an estimate or forecast, is found to be inaccurate in the absence of willful misconduct or fraud by
the party providing such Information (and for the avoidance of doubt, the RemainCo Entities shall have no liability to the SpinCo Entities to the extent
any such willful misconduct or fraud occurred prior to the Effective Time).

exchange, retention or confidential treatment of Information set forth in the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

either promptly destroy such Information or promptly return it to the providing party (at the receiving party’s option) and (ii) promptly deliver to the
providing party a certificate certifying that such Information was destroyed or returned, as the case may be, which certificate shall be signed by a duly
authorized officer of the receiving party.
(c) When any Information provided by one Group to the other (other than Information provided pursuant to Section 4.4) is no longer needed for the
purposes contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or is no longer required to be retained by applicable Law, the receiving
party will promptly, after request of the other party, either return to the other party all Information in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all
notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) or certify to the other party that it has destroyed such Information (and such copies thereof and such notes,
extracts or summaries based thereon).
4.7 Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation.
(a) After the Time of Distribution, except in the case of an adversarial Action by one party hereto (or any member of such party’s Group) against another
party hereto (or any member of such party’s Group) each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make available to each other party,
upon written request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as
witnesses and any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such
Person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other
documents may reasonably be required in connection with any Action in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved, regardless of
whether such Action is a matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder. The requesting party shall bear all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith; provided, in the event of any conflict between this Section 4.7(a) and Section 6.01 of the Tax Matters
Agreement, Section 6.01 of the Tax Matters Agreement will control.
(b) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to such Indemnifying Party, upon written request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other
personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other documents within its control or which it
otherwise has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such Persons (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers,
employees, other personnel and agents) or books,
D-21
Table of Contents
records or other documents that may reasonably be required in connection with such defense, settlement or compromise, or the prosecution, evaluation
or pursuit thereof, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate in such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or
pursuit, as the case may be. The Indemnifying Party shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith; provided, in the
event of any conflict between this Section 4.7(b) and Section 6.01 of the Tax Matters Agreement, Section 6.01 of the Tax Matters Agreement will control.

limit or otherwise modify the parties’ rights and obligations under Section 4.1.
4.8 Privileged Matters.
(a) The parties recognize that legal and other professional services that have been and will be provided prior to the Time of Distribution have been and
will be rendered for the collective benefit of each of the members of the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group, and that each of the members of the
RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group that were in privity with the professional service provider should be deemed to be the client with respect to such
services for the purposes of asserting all privileges which may be asserted under applicable Law in connection therewith. For purposes of this Section
4.8, privileges shall include the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine and any other legal principles and doctrines that protect information
and documents from disclosure to third parties.
(b) The parties agree as follows:
(i) The Company shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with any privileged Information
that relates solely to the RemainCo Business and not to the SpinCo Business, notwithstanding that the privileged Information might have been
known to, in the possession of or under the control of any member of the SpinCo Group. The Company shall also be entitled, in perpetuity, to
control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with any privileged Information that relates solely to any RemainCo Liabilities
resulting from any Actions that are now pending or may be asserted in the future, notwithstanding that the privileged Information might have been
known to, in the possession of or under the control of any member of the SpinCo Group; and
(ii) SpinCo shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with any privileged Information that
relates solely to the SpinCo Business and not to the RemainCo Business, notwithstanding that the privileged Information might have been known
to, in the possession of or under the control of any member of the RemainCo Group. SpinCo shall also be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the
assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with any privileged Information that relates solely to any SpinCo Liabilities resulting from any
Actions that are now pending or may be asserted in the future, notwithstanding that the privileged Information might have been known to, in the
possession of or under the control of any member of the RemainCo Group.
(c) Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.8, the parties agree that they shall have a joint privilege, each with the right to assert or waive any
such joint privilege, with respect to all privileges not allocated pursuant to Section 4.8(b) and all privileges relating to any Actions or other matters that
involve the interests of both the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group and in respect of which both parties have Liabilities under this Agreement, and
that no such joint privilege may be waived by either party without the consent of the other party. Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.8,
the parties agree that they shall have a joint client privilege, each with the right to assert or waive a privilege with respect to its own communications, with
respect to all privileges not allocated pursuant to Section 4.8(b) and all privileges relating to any Actions or other matters that involve the interests of

Table of Contents
(d) In the event of any Actions between the Company and SpinCo, or any members of their respective Groups, either party may waive a privilege or
permit disclosure of Information with regard to joint communications in which the other party or member of such other party’s Group has a joint client
privilege, without obtaining consent pursuant to Section 4.8(c); provided, that such waiver of a joint privilege or permission to disclose privileged
Information shall be effective only as to the use of Information with respect to the Action between the parties and/or the applicable members of their
respective Groups, and shall not operate as a waiver of the joint client privilege with respect to any third Person.
(e) If any dispute arises between the Company and SpinCo, or any members of their respective Groups, regarding whether a privilege should be waived or
Information should be disclosed to protect or advance the interests of either the RemainCo Group or the SpinCo Group, each party agrees that it shall (i)
negotiate with the other party in good faith, (ii) endeavor to minimize any prejudice to the rights of the other party and (iii) not unreasonably withhold,
condition or delay consent to any request for waiver or disclosure by the other party. Further, each party specifically agrees that it will not withhold its
consent to the waiver of a privilege or disclosure of Information for any purpose except to protect its own legitimate interests.
(f) In furtherance of the parties’ agreement under this Section 4.8, the Company and SpinCo shall, and shall cause applicable members of their respective
Group to, maintain their respective separate and joint privileges, including by forming joint defense and common interest agreements where necessary or
useful for this purpose.

have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed on or before the Time of Distribution, including in connection with the
Transactions and all other activities to implement the Separation, the Distribution and any of the other transactions contemplated hereunder and under
the other Transaction Documents.
(c) Nothing contained in Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b) shall in any way limit any Person’s rights or remedies under the other provisions of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or impair any right of any Person to enforce this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, in each case
in accordance with its terms. In addition, nothing contained in Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b) shall release any member of a Group from:
(i) any Liability provided in or resulting from any agreement among any members of the RemainCo Group or the SpinCo Group that is specified in
Section 6.8 as not to terminate as of the Time of Distribution, or any other Liability specified in such Section 6.8 as not to terminate as of the Time of

employee is or becomes a named defendant in any Action with respect to which he or she was or is entitled to such indemnification as set forth in this
Agreement.
(e) SpinCo shall not make, and shall not permit any member of the SpinCo Group to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any
claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against the Company or any member of the RemainCo Group, or any other
Person released pursuant to Section 5.1(a), with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 5.1(a). The Company shall not, and shall not permit

respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 5.1(b).
(f) It is the intent of each of the Company and SpinCo, by virtue of the provisions of this Section 5.1, to provide for a full and complete release and
discharge of all Liabilities existing or arising from all acts and events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur

and their respective directors, officers, agents or employees, on the one hand, and the Company or any member of the RemainCo Group and their

D-24

in their respective capacities as such, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “RemainCo
Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all Liabilities of the RemainCo Indemnified Parties relating to, arising out of or resulting from, directly or
indirectly any of the following items (without duplication): (i) any SpinCo Liability, (ii) except to the extent it relates to a RemainCo Liability, any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Transaction Documents (but excluding any such Liabilities to the extent
relating to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form 10, the related information statement or such other filings), and any Liabilities of the
RemainCo Indemnified Parties relating to, arising out of or resulting from claims by any stockholders of the Company in connection with the Distribution,
(iv) any termination, make-whole payments, prepayment fees or penalties, breakage fees or similar fees, costs or expenses incurred by the Company or
any member of the RemainCo Group related to or arising under any Shared Contracts and any contracts assigned to SpinCo under which SpinCo will be
providing services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement (but excluding any such amount expressly taken into account in the calculation of
Closing Net Debt Amount or that expressly are RemainCo Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (v) except as provided in Section 5.1, any and all Liabilities of the RemainCo Indemnified Parties relating to, arising out of or resulting

Parties”), from and against any and all Liabilities of the SpinCo Indemnified Parties relating to, arising out of or resulting from, directly or indirectly any of
the following items (without duplication) (i) any RemainCo Liability, (ii) except to the extent it related to a SpinCo Liability, any guarantee, indemnification
or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit support contract for the benefit of any member of the RemainCo Group by any member of the

Document after the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of such applicable agreement, in each case excluding any Liabilities that are
expressly SpinCo Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement.
5.4 Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts.
(a) Any Liability subject to indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Article V will be net of recoverable Insurance Proceeds actually received by
an Indemnified Party. Accordingly, the amount which any party (an “Indemnifying Party”) is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Article V
D-25
Table of Contents
(an “Indemnified Party”) will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds that are actually received by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of the
related Liability, as applicable. If an Indemnified Party receives a payment (an “Indemnity Payment”) required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying
Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds, then the Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to such Insurance Proceeds but not exceeding the amount of the Indemnity Payment paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Liability.
(b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the
indemnification provisions hereof, or have any subrogation rights with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to seek to collect or recover any third-party Insurance Proceeds (other than Insurance Proceeds under an arrangement where future premiums are
adjusted to reflect prior claims in excess of prior premiums) to which the Indemnified Party is entitled in connection with any Liability for which the
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to this Article V; provided, that the Indemnified Party’s inability to collect or recover any such
Insurance Proceeds shall not limit the Indemnifying Party’s obligations hereunder.
5.5 Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims.
(a) If an Indemnified Party receives written notice that a Person (including any Governmental Authority) that is not a member of the RemainCo Group or
the SpinCo Group has asserted any claim or commenced any Action (collectively, a “Third Party Claim”) that may implicate an Indemnifying Party’s
obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section 5.2 or Section 5.3, or any other Section of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as promptly as practicable (and no later than twenty (20) days or sooner, if
the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of the Third Party Claim. Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnified Party to provide notice in accordance with this Section 5.5(a) shall not relieve an
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent to which the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by
the Indemnified Party’s failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section 5.5(a).
(b) Subject to this Section 5.5(b) and Section 5.5(c), an Indemnifying Party may elect to control the defense of (and seek to settle or compromise), at its
own expense and with its own counsel, any Third Party Claim; provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense it shall
first (x) verify to the Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all
liabilities and obligations relating to such claim for indemnification and that (without regard to any dollar limitations otherwise set forth herein) it shall
provide full indemnification (whether or not otherwise required hereunder) to the Indemnified Party with respect to such action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder and (y) enter into an agreement with the Indemnified Party in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance of any liability or obligation which may
arise with respect to such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder. Within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 5.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires),
the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending the Third Party Claim
and shall specify any reservations or exceptions to its defense. After receiving notice of an Indemnifying Party’s election to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, whether with or without any reservations or exceptions with respect to such defense, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for the fees and expenses of its counsel and, in any event, shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, all witnesses, information and materials in such Indemnified Party’s possession or under
such Indemnified Party’s control relating thereto
D-26
Table of Contents
as are reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Article IV hereof). If an
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, whether with or without any reservations or exceptions with respect to such
defense, then such Indemnifying Party shall be solely liable for all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the defense of such Third Party
Claim and shall not be entitled to seek any indemnification or reimbursement from the Indemnified Party for any such fees or expenses incurred during the
course of its defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of any subsequent decision by the Indemnifying Party to reject or otherwise abandon its
assumption of such defense.
(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.5(b), if any Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that (i) the Proceeding is criminal in nature, (ii) such Third Party
Claim could reasonably have an adverse effect (reputational, economic or otherwise) that is material on the Indemnified Party and/or such Indemnified
Party’s Group, or otherwise materially impair any business relations of the Indemnified Party and/or such Indemnified Party’s Group, or (iii) there is an
actual conflict of interest if counsel for the Indemnifying Party represented both the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to control the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees and expenses of one (1) separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties.
(d) If an Indemnifying Party cannot or elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnified Party of its
election within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Party as provided in Section 5.5(b), the Indemnified Party may defend the
Third Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party is conducting the defense against any such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying
Party’s expense, all witnesses, information and materials in such Indemnifying Party’s possession or under such Indemnifying Party’s control relating
thereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnified Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Article IV hereof).
(e) Without the prior written consent of any Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no
Indemnified Party may settle or compromise, or seek to settle or compromise, any Third Party Claim. Without the prior written consent of any Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is seeking or may seek indemnity pursuant to
this Section 5.5 unless such judgment or settlement is solely for monetary damages, does not impose any expense or obligation on the Indemnified Party,
does not involve any finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of law by the Indemnified Party and provides for a full, unconditional and
irrevocable release of that Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with the Third Party Claim.
5.6 Additional Matters.
(a) Indemnification or contribution payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or contribution
under this Article V shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnified
Party, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification or contribution payment, including
documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article V shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party and (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnified Party of Liabilities for which it might be entitled to
indemnification or contribution hereunder.
(b) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement which does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the
Indemnified Party to the applicable Indemnifying Party
D-27
Table of Contents
describing such claim in reasonable detail and including copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to such claim. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If
such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnified Party shall be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents without prejudice to
its continuing rights to pursue indemnification or contribution hereunder.
(c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such
Indemnified Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party
Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and
expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
(d) In an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the
parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant if they conclude that substitution is desirable and practical. If such
substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the
Action as set forth in this Section 5.7(d), and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action
(including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys’ fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or
settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.
(e) For all Tax purposes, the Company and SpinCo agree to treat (i) any payment required by this Agreement (other than payments with respect to interest
accruing after the Time of Distribution) as either a contribution by the Company to SpinCo or an assumption by SpinCo of a RemainCo Liability, as the
case may be, occurring immediately prior to the Time of Distribution, and (ii) any payment of interest as taxable or deductible, as the case may be, to the
party entitled under this Agreement to retain such payment or required under this Agreement to make such payment, in either case except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.
5.7 Remedies Cumulative; Limitations of Liability. The rights provided in this Article V shall be cumulative and shall not preclude assertion by any
Indemnified Party of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
SpinCo or its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor the Company or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be liable to the other for any special, indirect,
punitive, exemplary, remote, speculative, consequential or similar damages in excess of compensatory damages of the other arising in connection with the
Transactions (provided, that any such liability with respect to a Third Party Claim shall be considered direct damages).
5.8 Survival of Indemnities. The rights and obligations of each of the Company and SpinCo and their respective Indemnified Parties under this Article V
shall survive the Distribution, the Effective Time and the sale or other transfer by any party of any Assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any
Liabilities, including the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.
ARTICLE VI
OTHER AGREEMENTS
6.1 Further Assurances.
(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use (and
will cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
D-28
Table of Contents
to use) reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done,
all things reasonably necessary on its part under applicable Law or contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Transactions, and the other Transaction Documents. In furtherance of such efforts, prior to the Time of
Distribution, the Company may adjust or modify the Plan of Separation from time to time as it determines is advisable to effect the Separation, provided
that no such adjustment or modification that would adversely affect the RemainCo Group shall be implemented without Parent’s prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each party hereto shall, subject to Section 2.6(a), cooperate with the other
parties, and without any further consideration, but at the expense of the requesting party from and after the Time of Distribution, to execute and deliver, or
use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and
to obtain or make any Approvals or Notifications from or with any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, agreement,
indenture or other instrument, and to take all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to take by any other party hereto from time to
time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the transfers of the Assets and the assignment and assumption of the Liabilities and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, each party will, at the reasonable request, cost
and expense of any other party, take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to vest in such other party good and marketable title to the
Assets allocated to such party under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, free and clear of any Security Interest except as
contemplated by any Transaction Document or, solely in the case of SpinCo Assets, as contemplated by any of the SpinCo Financing Commitment Letter.
(c) At or prior to the Time of Distribution, the Company and SpinCo in their respective capacities as direct and indirect shareholders of their respective
Subsidiaries, shall each ratify any actions that are reasonably necessary or desirable to be taken by SpinCo or any other Subsidiary of the Company or
SpinCo, as the case may be, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Transactions.
6.2 Confidentiality.
(a) From and after the Time of Distribution, subject to Section 6.2(c) and except as contemplated by or otherwise provided in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and officers, directors, employees, and other agents and representatives,
including attorneys, agents, customers, suppliers, contractors, consultants and other representatives of any Person providing financing (collectively,
“Representatives”), not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than Representatives of such party or of its
Affiliates who reasonably need to know such information in providing services to any member of the RemainCo Group, any SpinCo Confidential
Information. If any disclosures are made to any member of the RemainCo Group in connection with any services provided to a member of the SpinCo
Group under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, then the SpinCo Confidential Information so disclosed shall be used only as required in
connection with the receipt of such services. The Company shall use the same degree of care to prevent and restrain the unauthorized use or disclosure
of the SpinCo Confidential Information by any of its Representatives as it currently uses for its own confidential information of a like nature, but in no
event less than a reasonable standard of care. For purposes of this Section 6.2(a), any Information, material or documents relating to the SpinCo Business
currently or formerly conducted, or proposed to be conducted, by any member of the SpinCo Group furnished to, or in possession of, any member of the
RemainCo Group, irrespective of the form of communication, and all notes, analyses, compilations, forecasts, data, translations, studies, memoranda or
other documents prepared by the Company or its officers, directors and Affiliates, that contain or otherwise reflect such information, material or
documents is referred to herein as “SpinCo Confidential Information.” SpinCo Confidential Information does not include, and
D-29

disclosure by any member of the RemainCo Group not otherwise permissible hereunder, (ii) the Company can demonstrate became available to the
Company after the Time of Distribution from a source other than the Company, SpinCo or their Affiliates or (iii) is developed independently by the
Company without reference to the SpinCo Confidential Information; provided, however, that, in the case of clause (ii), the source of such information was
not known by the Company to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to,
SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group with respect to such information.
(b) From and after the Time of Distribution, subject to Section 6.2(c) and except as contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
SpinCo shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate
to any Person other than Representatives of such party or of its Affiliates who reasonably need to know such information in providing services to
SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group, any RemainCo Confidential Information. If any disclosures are made to any member of the SpinCo Group in
connection with any services provided to a member of the SpinCo Group under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, then the RemainCo
Confidential Information so disclosed shall be used only as required in connection with the receipt of such services. The SpinCo Group shall use the
same degree of care to prevent and restrain the unauthorized use or disclosure of the RemainCo Confidential Information by any of their Representatives
as they use for their own confidential information of a like nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. For purposes of this Section
6.2(b), any Information, material or documents relating to the businesses currently or formerly conducted, or proposed to be conducted, by the Company
or any of its Affiliates (other than any member of the SpinCo Group) furnished to, or in possession of, any member of the SpinCo Group, irrespective of
the form of communication, and all notes, analyses, compilations, forecasts, data, translations, studies, memoranda or other documents prepared by
SpinCo, any member of the SpinCo Group or their respective officers, directors and Affiliates, that contain or otherwise reflect such information, material
or documents is hereinafter referred to as “RemainCo Confidential Information.” RemainCo Confidential Information does not include, and there shall be
no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of a disclosure by any
member of the SpinCo Group not otherwise permissible hereunder, (ii) SpinCo can demonstrate became available to SpinCo after the Time of Distribution
from a source other than SpinCo, the Company or their respective Affiliates or (iii) is developed independently by such member of the SpinCo Group
without reference to the RemainCo Confidential Information; provided, however, that, in the case of clause (ii), the source of such information was not
known by SpinCo to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or
its Affiliates with respect to such information.
(c) If the Company or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or SpinCo or its Affiliates, on the other hand, are requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) by any Governmental Authority or
pursuant to applicable Law to disclose or provide any SpinCo Confidential Information or RemainCo Confidential Information, as applicable, the party
receiving such request or demand shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other party with written notice of such request or demand as
promptly as practicable under the circumstances so that such other party shall have an opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order. The party
receiving such request or demand agrees to take, and cause its representatives to take, at the requesting party’s expense, all other reasonable steps
necessary to obtain confidential treatment by the recipient. Subject to the foregoing, the party that received such request or demand may thereafter
disclose or provide any SpinCo Confidential Information or RemainCo Confidential Information, as the case may be, to the extent required by such Law
(as so advised by counsel) or by lawful process; provided, however, that the party that received such request or demand shall reasonably cooperate with
a party seeking to protect its Confidential Information at such party’s expense.
(d) Each of the Company and SpinCo acknowledges that it and the other members of its Group may have in their possession confidential or proprietary
information of third Persons that was received under
D-30
Table of Contents
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements with such third Persons prior to the Distribution Date. Each of the Company and SpinCo agrees that it will
hold, and will cause the other members of its Group and their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence the confidential and proprietary
information of third Persons to which it or any other member of its respective Group has access, in accordance with the terms of any agreements entered
into prior to the Distribution Date between or among one (1) or more members of the applicable party’s Group and such third Persons to the extent
disclosed to such party.
6.3 Insurance Matters.
(a) The Company acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the members of the RemainCo Group, that, from and after the Time
of Distribution, neither the Company nor any members the RemainCo Group shall have any rights to or under any of SpinCo’s or the SpinCo Group’s
insurance policies, provided, that, in the event any insurable loss or damage to any material Company Stations’ assets occurs prior to Closing and the
payment for any repair or replacement of such assets has not been made prior to Closing (such that Cash and Cash Equivalents has been reduced),
SpinCo agrees that it will pay over any Insurance Proceeds actually received in connection with such loss or damage to the Company net of SpinCo’s
costs and expense.
(b) At the Time of Distribution, all insurance policies (and rights and obligations thereunder) of any member of SpinCo Group or RemainCo Group, shall
be retained by or transferred to a member of SpinCo Group, as applicable, other than the insurance policies acquired prior to the Time of Distribution by
and in the name of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.3(c) hereof.
(c) Neither SpinCo nor any member of the SpinCo Group shall have any obligation to secure extended reporting for any claims under any of SpinCo’s or
the SpinCo Group claims-made or occurrence-reported liability policies for any acts or omissions by the Company or any member of the RemainCo Group
incurred prior to the Time of Distribution.
(d) This Agreement shall not be considered as an attempted assignment of any policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be
construed to waive any right or remedy of either SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group in respect of any of the SpinCo insurance policies and
programs or any other contract or policy of insurance.
6.4 Litigation; Cooperation.
(a) Assumed Actions.
(i) As of the Time of Distribution, SpinCo shall assume and thereafter, except as provided in Article V, be responsible for the administration of all

respect thereto) and consult each other to the extent necessary or advisable with respect to such Third Party Claim.

Date. Each Party shall, at the reasonable request of the other Party, take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be necessary to effect the
foregoing. The Parties, on behalf of the members of their respective Groups, hereby waive any advance notice provision or other termination
requirements with respect to any Intercompany Agreement.

“Dispute Notice”) to the Company and SpinCo. If Parent delivers a Dispute Notice, then the Company, SpinCo and Parent shall attempt to agree on the
allocation of such Assets and Liabilities within the fifteen (15) day period following the delivery of Parent’s Dispute Notice. If the Company, SpinCo and
Parent agree on the allocation within such period, then the allocation on which they so agree shall be effected pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Company, SpinCo, and Parent do not so agree within such period, then the unresolved disagreement shall
be elevated to their respective chief legal officers (or their designees) for discussion and resolution in good faith.

Agreement may be terminated and the Distribution abandoned at any time prior to the Time of Distribution by and in the sole discretion of the Company
without the prior approval of any Person, including SpinCo. In the event of such termination, this Agreement shall become void and no party, or any of
its officers and directors shall have any liability to any Person by reason of this Agreement. After the Time of Distribution, this Agreement may not be
terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by each of the parties to this Agreement.
7.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a matter of public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Transactions, be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
7.8 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto)
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, between or on behalf of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
7.9 Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of all of the other
parties hereto. Except as provided in Article V with respect to Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and members of their respective Group and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. In the
event of a subsequent transfer or sale of the Company or the RemainCo Group or transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or
the RemainCo Group following Closing (or a material portion of the assets of the Company or the RemainCo Group to an Affiliate that is not wholly-
owned by RemainCo), the Company agrees that (i) as a condition to such transfer or
D-35
Table of Contents
sale, it will require the transferee to agree in writing to assume all the obligations and liabilities of the Company and the RemainCo Group under this
Agreement (or in the case of a sale or transfer to an Affiliate, the obligations and liabilities of the Company and the RemainCo Group corresponding to the
assets transferred or sold), and (ii) in the case of such a sale or transfer to an Affiliate, such transfer or sale shall not release the Company or the
RemainCo Group from any of their obligations or liabilities under this Agreement. In the event of a subsequent transfer or sale of SpinCo or the SpinCo
Group or transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of SpinCo or the SpinCo Group following Closing (or a material portion of the assets of the
SpinCo Group to an Affiliate that is not wholly-owned by SpinCo), SpinCo agrees that (i) as a condition to such transfer or sale, it will require the
transferee to agree in writing to assume all the obligations and liabilities of SpinCo and the SpinCo Group under this Agreement (or in the case of a sale or
transfer to an Affiliate, the obligations and liabilities of SpinCo and the SpinCo Group corresponding to the assets transferred or sold), and (ii) in the case
of such a sale or transfer to an Affiliate, such transfer or sale shall not release SpinCo or the SpinCo Group from any of their obligations or liabilities under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the SpinCo Lenders shall be a third-party beneficiary of Section 7.2(b), this
Section 7.9, Section 7.10(c), Section 7.10(d), Section 7.11, and Section 7.14.
7.10 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
(a) The rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the
federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties’ rights in this Section 7.10 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby
waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 7.10.
(b) In addition, each of the parties (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State
of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts
has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and (iv) consents to service of process being
made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 7.5.
(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any action or proceeding, whether in
contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, against any SpinCo Lender arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the SpinCo Financing) shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
in the Borough of Manhattan (and the appellate courts thereof) and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action or
proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and agrees not to bring any such action or proceeding in any other court.

subsequent breach. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, this Section 7.11, Section 7.2(b), Section 7.9, Section 7.10(c), Section 7.10(d), Section 7.11,
and Section 7.14 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of any such Section, and any related definitions insofar as they affect such Sections) shall not be amended, waived or otherwise modified
in a manner that is adverse to the interests of any SpinCo Lender party to the Company Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of such
SpinCo Lender.

Liabilities and rights associated with SpinCo Participants are to be assumed by SpinCo or a SpinCo Group Member, in each case, except as specifically set
forth herein. Accordingly, as of the Time of Distribution, SpinCo or another member of the SpinCo Group hereby retains or assumes and agrees to pay,
perform, fulfill, and discharge, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (i) all Liabilities and rights arising under or related to the Company Plans
and the SpinCo Plans with respect to any SpinCo Participant or Former SpinCo Participant, (ii) all employment or service-related Liabilities (including
Liabilities relating to transfer of employment or service, terminations of employment or service and any deemed termination of employment or service) and
rights with respect to all SpinCo Participants and (iii) any other Liabilities expressly transferred to SpinCo or a SpinCo Group member under this
Agreement. In accordance with Section 7.2 hereof, SpinCo shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each RemainCo Group Member against
any Liabilities or obligations allocated to, or retained or assumed by, SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group pursuant to this Agreement. Any and all
Liabilities relating to any RemainCo Service Providers and Former RemainCo Service Providers, in each case except as specifically set forth herein, shall

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS

actions (if any) as are required to cause SpinCo or a SpinCo Group Member to assume sponsorship of the Company Defined Contribution Plan and for

the Company shall retain Liabilities to fund such matching contributions for such RemainCo Service Providers. If, and to the extent, investments under
such Plan are comprised of Company Common Stock, SpinCo shall determine the extent to which and when Company Common Stock shall cease to be an
investment alternative thereunder. The Company, Parent, SpinCo, and any other Parties will take all actions necessary to provide for the rollover of any

were participants in such plans will be treated as not having experienced a separation from service until such employees have separated from service from
all SpinCo Group Members. RemainCo Service Providers who were participants in such plans will be considered to experience a separation from service
for distribution purposes at the time of such transfer and assignment of the Deferred Compensation Plans to SpinCo or a SpinCo Group Member. For the

do so would violate such a fiduciary duty or standard. Each Party shall be responsible for taking such actions as are deemed necessary and appropriate
to comply with its own fiduciary responsibilities and shall fully release and indemnify the other Party for any Liabilities caused by the failure to satisfy
any such responsibility.
6.5 Consent of Third Parties. If any provision of this Agreement is dependent on the consent of any third party (such as a vendor or Governmental
Authority) and such consent is withheld, the Company and SpinCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the applicable provisions of
this Agreement to the full extent practicable. If any provision of this Agreement cannot be implemented due to the failure of such third party to consent,
the Company and SpinCo shall negotiate in good faith to implement the provision in a mutually satisfactory manner. The phrase “commercially reasonable

copies of the pertinent portion of any written communication from a Taxing Authority and contain factual information (to the extent known) describing
any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice and other documents received from any Taxing Authority

Parent is not the Controlling Party (the “Non-Controlling Party”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes for
which the Non-Controlling Party may be liable hereunder or which would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Non-Controlling Party:

Controlling Party in such Tax Proceeding with respect to such Taxes; (ii) the Controlling Party shall timely provide the Non-Controlling Party copies of
any written materials relating to such Tax Proceeding received from any Taxing Authority with respect to such Taxes; (iii) the Controlling Party shall
timely provide the Non-Controlling Party with copies of any correspondence or filings submitted to any Taxing Authority or judicial authority in
connection with such Taxes in such Tax Proceeding; (iv) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the Non-Controlling
Party a reasonable opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such potential Taxes in such
Tax Proceeding; (v) the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith; and (vi) the Controlling Party shall not settle any
such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The failure of the Controlling Party to take any action specified in the preceding sentence shall not relieve the Non-Controlling Party of any liability
and/or obligation which it may have to the Controlling Party under this Agreement except to the extent that the Non-Controlling Party was actually
harmed by such failure.

EXECUTION VERSION
TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT
THIS TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of May 3, 2021, with effectiveness as of the Closing Date
under the Merger Agreement (“Effective Date”), among Meredith Holdings Corporation, an Iowa corporation (“Provider”), Meredith Corporation, an
Iowa corporation (“Recipient”), and Gray Television, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Parent”). Provider, Recipient, and Parent are each referred to herein as a
“Party” and collectively as the “Parties”. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement (as
defined below).
WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 3, 2021, by and among Recipient, Parent, and Gray
Hawkeye Stations, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), Recipient, Parent and Merger Sub desire to
effect the acquisition of Recipient by Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Recipient, with Recipient surviving the merger as the
surviving corporation;
WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Recipient desires that Provider provide Recipient certain
temporary transition services to Recipient from and after the Effective Date with respect to the Company Stations;
WHEREAS, Provider has agreed to provide to Recipient, from and after the Effective Date, such temporary transition services on the terms and
conditions set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, this Agreement constitutes the Transition Services Agreement referred to in the Merger Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, conditions and provisions contained herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of Provider and Recipient hereby agrees as follows:
ARTICLE I
TRANSITION SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY PROVIDER
1.1 Transition Services. During the Term, Provider shall provide to Recipient, on the terms set forth herein, the services specifically listed on Schedule A
attached hereto (the “Services Schedule”). The services described in the Services Schedule are, collectively, the “Transition Services”. Upon the
expiration of the Term (or earlier pursuant to Article V) the obligations of Provider with respect to the provision of the Transition Services (or applicable
Transition Service) shall automatically and immediately terminate.
1.2 Standard of Performance. Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (or cause to be provided) to Recipient the Transition Services
at substantially the same level of service, and with substantially the same degree of care, as Provider uses in its own business. It is understood and
agreed that Provider may from time to time modify, change or enhance the manner, nature, quality and/or standard of care of any Transition Service to the
extent Provider is making a similar change in the performance of its own services similar to such Transition Services.
1.3 Usage. The Transition Services may not be used by Recipient for any other purpose or in any other manner (including as to volume, amount, level or
frequency, as applicable) other than as the Transition Services were used in connection with the Recipient’s business as of the Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Transition Services shall be used only by Recipient and solely in connection with the operation
G-1Table of Contents
of the Recipient’s business and Recipient shall not resell, license the use of, or otherwise permit the use by others of any such Transition Services.
Provider shall have no obligation to provide, or to cause to be provided, Transition Services to any Person other than Recipient and its Affiliates.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Transition Services are not intended to (and shall not) include assistance for expansion, acquisition,
employee additions or reductions not in the ordinary course of business, new applications, or site redesign by Recipient or any of its Affiliates or their
respective businesses.
1.4 Right to Change Practices. Nothing herein shall prohibit Provider from making such changes as it deems necessary in its sole discretion with respect
to the means by which it provides services (including upgrading or changing technology, software or information systems used by it in connection with
this Agreement and replacing third-party service providers) and applying such changes, to the extent applicable, to the Transition Services; provided,
however, that such changes shall not materially and adversely affect the Transition Services hereunder and that the Provider shall provide at least twenty
(20) days’ prior notice of any material change and the Parties shall discuss in good faith whether such change can be implemented so as not to so affect
the Transition Services provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Provider shall have no obligation to provide, or
cause to be provided, Transition Services to the extent that any changes are made to the business of the Recipient or its Affiliates that materially increase
or materially and adversely change Provider’s burden or cost with respect to the provision of such Transition Services, or that make commercially
impracticable the provision of such Transition Services.
1.5 Cooperation; Access.
(a) Recipient agrees to fully cooperate (at Recipient’s sole cost and expense) in all reasonable respects with Provider in connection with any matters
related to the provision or receipt of the Transition Services. To the extent required for the performance of any Transition Service, Recipient shall, at its
own expense, provide to Provider reasonable access, on an as needed basis, to Recipient’s and its Affiliates’ personnel, equipment, office space,
telecommunications and computer systems and any other assets and operations reasonably required for delivery of all or any part of the Transition
Services. Provider and its Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers shall be entitled to rely, without inquiry, upon the genuineness, validity or
truthfulness of any document, instrument or other writing presented by Recipient or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement.
(b) Provider and its Affiliates and any Third Party Service Providers shall not be liable for any impairment of any Transition Service directly caused by
their not receiving the information, materials or access required by this Section 1.5. If any Transition Service provided hereunder is dependent on, or will
require the involvement or performance of, Recipient or any of its Affiliates (including Recipient or its Affiliates maintaining sufficient and appropriate
levels of staffing, including, as applicable, with respect to level of experience and skill), Provider and its Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers shall
not be deemed in breach of this Agreement, including any Services Schedule hereto, or otherwise be liable for any failure to provide any Transition
Services, or to otherwise fully perform any of its obligations hereunder, including any Services Schedule, to the extent arising from any failure of
Recipient or any of its Affiliates to fully perform its obligations hereunder.
(c) As required by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, at all times Recipient shall be responsible for maintaining the supervision and control of
the Stations to which the Transition Services are being provided, including control of such Stations’ personnel, programming and finances.
1.6 Transitional Nature of Services. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that Provider is providing (or causing to be provided) the Transition Services on a
transition basis only in order to allow Recipient a period of time to provide or obtain similar services for itself, and that Provider is not a commercial
provider of such Transition Services. Accordingly, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and in no event later than the
end of the Term, Recipient agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
G-2
Table of Contents
transition each Transition Service to its own internal organization or obtain alternate third-party sources to provide the Transition Services and end its
use of each and every Transition Service (the cessation of a Transition Service, a “Service Migration”). In no event shall Provider be responsible for
providing any services in connection with, or bearing any costs of, any Service Migration.
1.7 Compliance with Law; Exclusions.
(a) Neither Provider nor any of its Affiliates nor any Third Party Service Provider shall be obligated to perform, or to cause to be performed, any
Transition Service in a manner that is not consistent with their respective policies, procedures and practices, and Provider shall determine, in its sole
discretion, the means and resources used to provide the Transition Services pursuant to this Agreement. Provider’s obligation to provide the Transition
Services hereunder is subject, in all respects, to the current policies, procedures and practices of Provider and its Affiliates, including as such policies,
procedures and practices may be amended by Provider or its Affiliates from time to time in the ordinary course of business, as applicable. Provider shall
not have any obligation to (x) replace or cause the replacement of any Person who is employed or otherwise engaged by Provider or any of its Affiliates
to perform Transition Services upon the termination of such Person’s employment or other engagement with Provider or any of its Affiliates, as the case
may be, for whatever reason (provided that Provider shall still provide the Transition Services using suitably qualified, skilled and experienced personnel),
or (y) perform or cause to be performed any Transition Services performed by any Person who is employed or otherwise engaged by Provider or any of its
Affiliates if such Person becomes employed or otherwise engaged by Recipient or any of its Affiliates during the Term.
(b) Each Party shall, at its own expense, perform its obligations and exercise its rights hereunder in material compliance with all applicable Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, including in any Services Schedule, Provider, its Affiliates and any Third Party Service Providers shall
not be required hereunder to take any action (including by providing any Transition Services) that would constitute (a) a violation of applicable Law, (b) a
breach of any of Provider’s contractual obligations to a third party, or (c) any other violation of a third party’s rights.
(c) Except as expressly set forth on Schedule A, the Transition Services shall in no event include, and Provider shall not be required to provide or cause
to be provided to Recipient, services that involve or relate to (i) the custody of cash; (ii) the commingling of funds; (iii) the provision of legal, compliance,
regulatory or tax advice; (iv) the filing of tax returns; (v) the provision of data or records except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement or herein;
(vi) the funding of any “employee benefit plan” as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or other retirement, deferred compensation, incentive,
equity based, severance, employment, change in control or fringe benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA, adopted
or maintained by Recipient or its Affiliates (the “Recipient Employee Benefit Plans”), other than those set forth on Schedule A; (vii) any benefit program
compliance services with respect to any Recipient Employee Benefit Plans; or (viii) the funding of any payroll, payroll taxes or workers’ compensation.
Recipient further acknowledges and agrees that Provider will not become a fiduciary (including for purposes of ERISA) with respect to any Recipient
Employee Benefit Plans by reason of providing any of the Transition Services under this Agreement, and to the extent the provision of any such
Transition Service would cause Provider to become a fiduciary (including for purposes of ERISA, the Code, or other applicable Laws) with respect to any
Recipient Employee Benefit Plan, Provider shall not be required to provide, or cause to be provided, such Transition Services to any of the Recipient or its
Affiliates.
1.8 Delegation of Transition Services. Recipient acknowledges that Provider may provide the applicable Transition Services itself, through any of its
Affiliates or through one or more third parties engaged by Provider to provide Transition Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (each
such third party, a “Third Party Service Provider”). Provider acknowledges that notwithstanding any delegation of its responsibilities under this
Agreement, it shall remain responsible for the provision of the Transition Services and its Affiliates’ and Third Party Service Provider’s compliance with
the standard of performance set forth herein.

licensed, sublicensed or otherwise provided by third parties to Provider for the benefit of Recipient to the extent that such licenses or sublicenses are
necessary in connection with and ancillary to the provision of the Services (each such third party, a “Pass-Through Service Provider”). The terms for
such licenses or sublicenses provided to Provider will be the same as the terms, and, in any event, shall not be inconsistent with the terms, for which
Recipient continues to receive the relevant Transition Services. Such licenses or sublicenses may be set forth on Schedule A in connection with the
related Transition Services or otherwise provided to Recipient. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.9 is applicable to any license or sublicense that
is required for a necessary or inherent part of the Transition Services, whether or not specifically itemized on Schedule A. Recipient hereby agrees to
comply with Seller’ reasonable instructions with respect to compliance with the terms of such licenses and sublicenses. Recipient acknowledges that

or implied, is being granted by Provider under this Agreement.
1.11 License to Use Purchased Assets. Recipient, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to Provider, its Affiliates, any Pass-Through Service
Provider and any Third Party Service Provider a limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license to use the Intellectual Property included
in the Purchased Assets, and any other Purchased Assets and other Intellectual Property controlled by Recipient or any of its Affiliates, in each case, as
may be reasonably necessary to perform the Transition Services in connection with, and solely during the Term of, and solely for the purposes of
performing the Transition Services under, this Agreement. The license set forth in this Section 1.10 shall automatically and immediately terminate upon the

month during the Term for any Third Party Pass Through Costs for the prior month.
2.2 Third Party Costs. Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all costs, fees and charges paid by Provider to Third Party Service Providers and Pass-

Third Party Pass Through Cost will be automatically adjusted to reflect such changes after Provider provides Recipient reasonable documentation
supporting such change.
2.3 Invoices. Provider shall invoice Recipient monthly for the Transition Services, including all Third Party Pass Through Costs, and Recipient shall pay
Provider within thirty (30) days after the date of each such invoice. Each invoice shall set forth in reasonable detail the applicable Transition Services
provided during such period and the corresponding amounts owed for each of the Transition Services. Recipient shall not offset any amounts payable by
it hereunder against any other amounts owed to it by Provider. If Recipient fails to pay the full amount of any undisputed invoice within such thirty (30)
day period, such failure will be considered a
G-4

material breach of this Agreement, for which Provider may, without liability and in its sole discretion, suspend its obligations hereunder to provide any
and all Transition Services to Recipient until such time as all invoices have been paid in full or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(b).
2.4 Taxes. The fees described herein with respect to the Transition Services do not include any Taxes. In addition to the amounts required to be paid as

provision of Transition Services hereunder.

Provider on behalf of Recipient (including in connection with the Accounts Receivable Services).
ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIVES
3.1 Coordinators. Provider and Recipient shall each designate in writing a representative to act as Provider’s and Recipient’s respective primary contact
persons to coordinate the provision of all of the Transition Services (collectively, the “Primary Coordinators”). Each Primary Coordinator may designate
one or more service coordinators for each specific Transition Service (the “Service Coordinators”). Each Party may treat an act of a Primary Coordinator of
another Party as being authorized by such other Party without inquiring behind such act or ascertaining whether such Primary Coordinator had authority
to so act, and each Party may treat an act of a Service Coordinator as being authorized by such other Party only to the extent such act is directly related
to the Transition Service for which such Service Coordinator has been designated; provided, however, that no such Primary Coordinator or Service
Coordinator has authority to amend this Agreement. Each Party shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days) advise the other in
writing of any change in its Primary Coordinator or any Service Coordinator for a particular Transition Service. Provider and Recipient agree that all
communications relating to the provision of the Transition Services shall be by electronic mail and shall be directed to the Service Coordinators for such
Transition Service with copies to the Primary Coordinators.

consent, where necessary, of any relevant third party, and Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such third-party consents;
provided, however, that if such consents cannot be obtained, the Parties shall work together in good faith and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange for alternative methods of delivering such Transition Service. Provider and Recipient shall each negotiate in good faith to
determine the responsibility for paying the costs, fees and expenses of obtaining any third party consents or arranging alternative methods of delivering
Transition Services.

the costs incurred by Provider resulting from Recipient’s early termination or reduction of such Transition Service being performed, including
commitments made to, or in respect of, personnel or Third Party Service Providers, prepaid expenses related to the terminated or reduced Transition
Service and costs related to terminating such commitments. Such reimbursement shall be made by Recipient to Provider in accordance with Article II.

and agrees that the termination or expiration of a Transition Service or this Agreement for any reason shall not release a Party from any liability or
obligation that already has accrued as of the effective date of such termination or expiration, as applicable, and shall not constitute a waiver or release of,
or otherwise be deemed to adversely affect, any rights, remedies or claims which a Party may have hereunder at Law, in equity or otherwise or which may

CONFIDENTIALITY
8.1 Duty of Confidentiality. Each Party (a “Receiving Party”) agrees to safeguard the other Party’s (the “Disclosing Party”) Confidential Information
received under this Agreement with the same degree of care that the Receiving Party uses to protect its own similar Confidential Information, but in no
event less than a reasonable degree of care. Such Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party received hereunder may be used by the Receiving
Party in connection with the Transition Services only and may only be copied or reproduced to the extent reasonably necessary for the Receiving Party
to perform its obligations or enforce its rights under this Agreement. The Disclosing Party shall not disclose any such Confidential Information of the
Receiving Party to any Person; provided, that, Provider may disclose Recipient’s Confidential Information to any of its Affiliates or Third Party Service
Providers as may be reasonably necessary to perform the Transition Services in connection with, and solely during the Term of, and solely for the

8.2 Permitted Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Section 8.1 shall not restrict the Receiving Party from disclosing
Confidential Information to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or as required by applicable Law or
legal or regulatory process (including to the extent requested by any Governmental Body in connection with any such Law or legal or regulatory
process), including any Tax audit or litigation. In the event that the Receiving Party or its permitted service providers become legally required by
deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, formal regulatory request or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide the Disclosing
Party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other similar remedy to cause such
Confidential Information not to be disclosed. The Receiving Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s expense,
in connection with the Disclosing Party’s seeking of such protective order or similar remedy. In the event that such protective order or other similar
remedy is not obtained or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 8.2, the Receiving Party or its permitted service
provider shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that has been legally required, and shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded such disclosed Confidential Information.
8.3 Confidential Information. The following shall be considered “Confidential Information” of a Party under this Agreement: all proprietary and
confidential information, provided or received in connection with the provision of the Transition Services hereunder, concerning the business, business
relationships (including prospective customers and business partners) and financial affairs of such Party or its Affiliates, whether or not in writing and
whether or not labeled or identified as confidential or proprietary, including inventions, trade secrets, technical information, know-how, product and
pricing information and plans, research and development activities, marketing plans and activities, customer, supplier and prospect information, employee
and financial information, and information disclosed by third parties of a proprietary or confidential nature or under an obligation of confidence; provided
that Confidential Information does not include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder, with respect to information that (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, (ii) the Receiving Party can demonstrate
was or became available to the Receiving Party from a third party not bound by any confidentiality obligation to the Disclosing Party, (iii) was already in
the Receiving Party’s possession (without an obligation of confidentiality) prior to direct or indirect disclosure pursuant to this Agreement (or any
predecessor agreement between the Parties governing the confidentiality of such information) and was not generated in the course of, or in connection
with, the Transition Services, or (iv) is developed independently by the Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential
Information.

jurisdiction.
(b) Each Party agrees that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of
Delaware, and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in
any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such party as provided

G-11

Event has abated. If Provider fails to provide any Transition Services in connection with any Force Majeure Event, the amounts due Provider under this
