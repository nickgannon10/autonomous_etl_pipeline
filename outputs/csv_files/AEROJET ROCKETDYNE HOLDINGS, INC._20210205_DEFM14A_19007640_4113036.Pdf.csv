Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Aerojet Rocketdyne will continue as the surviving corporation and as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, Aerojet
Rocketdyne will cease to be a publicly traded company and all outstanding shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $56.00 per share in cash, without interest and less, to
the extent paid or payable as discussed further in this proxy statement, the $5.00 per share amount of the Pre-Closing
Dividend (defined below), which we refer to as the “Price Per Share” or “Merger Consideration,” except for (i) any
shares held by Aerojet Rocketdyne or any wholly owned subsidiary of Aerojet Rocketdyne (or held in Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s treasury), including shares of common stock reserved for issuance under any of our equity and

plans or trusts related thereto, (ii) any shares held, directly or indirectly, by Lockheed Martin or Merger Sub, and (iii)

You will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation upon the consummation of the Merger.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer
have any rights as a stockholder of Aerojet Rocketdyne (except that stockholders who properly exercise their
appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to
an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described below in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Appraisal Rights”).
The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly after the effective time of the Merger, a designated paying agent will
send each holder of record of a certificate representing shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock or of
uncertificated shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger a
customary letter of transmittal and instructions advising such holder as to how to surrender or transfer such shares
of common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The paying agent will promptly pay such holders the
Merger Consideration upon (i) the surrender of a certificate representing shares of common stock to the paying agent
(or compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the paying agent for transfer of uncertificated shares)
and (ii) delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the
paying agent or Lockheed Martin. Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of cash payments. The amount of any

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding unvested share of Aerojet Rocketdyne restricted common stock
will (i) automatically become fully vested (and for shares subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed
achievement of maximum performance) and (ii) be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the Price Per Share, plus, to the extent paid or payable to holders of our common stock and payable but
unpaid on such share of restricted common stock, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, less applicable
taxes or other withholdings.
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding option and stock appreciation right (“SAR”) with respect to
shares of our common stock that have an exercise price or grant price that is less than the Price Per Share will be
automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive, upon delivery of a notice and acknowledgment, cash
in an amount equal to the total number of shares subject to the award multiplied by the excess of the Price Per Share
over the per share exercise or grant price (as applicable), less applicable taxes and other withholdings. Each
outstanding option and SAR with exercise or grant prices equal to or greater than the Price Per Share will be canceled
for no consideration at the effective time of the Merger.
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding unvested restricted stock unit (“RSU”) with respect to shares
of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, to the extent granted prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, will be
automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the total number of shares
subject to the award (for units subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum
performance) multiplied by the sum of the Price Per Share, plus, to the extent paid or payable to holders of our
common stock and payable but unpaid on such restricted stock units, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing
Dividend, less applicable taxes or other withholdings.
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding unvested restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock that was granted on or after the date of the execution of the Merger Agreement will be
automatically canceled. With respect to each cancelled restricted stock unit, (i) for individuals who remain employed
by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates as of the grant date of the Lockheed Martin restricted stock units contemplated
hereby (which grant date shall be within 30 days of the effective date of the Merger), Lockheed Martin will grant a
replacement award of Lockheed Martin restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Lockheed Martin
stock equal to the total number of shares subject to the award (for units subject to performance vesting criteria,
based on deemed achievement of maximum performance) multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) or (ii) for individuals who do not remain employed by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates as of
such date, Lockheed Martin will pay an amount in cash equal to the total number of shares subject to the canceled
award (for units subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance)
multiplied by the sum of the Price Per Share, plus, to the extent paid to holders of our common stock and payable but
unpaid on such restricted stock units, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, less applicable withholding
taxes.
In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will (i) accrue dividends payable
with respect to restricted shares of common stock; (ii) reduce the exercise price with respect to options to purchase
common stock; (iii) reduce the grant price with respect to SARs; and (iv) accrue dividend equivalents payable with
respect to RSUs, in each case that are issued and outstanding as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, and in an
amount equal to the per-share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.

acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
document or contract constituting or relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to result in or lead
to, an Acquisition Transaction (other than certain confidentiality agreements permitted pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement) (or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action).
Any action referred to in the first or second bullet above is a “Company Change in Recommendation.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, the Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the approval of the Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholders of the Merger Agreement, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors may effect a Company
Change in Recommendation (and may also cause Aerojet Rocketdyne to terminate the Merger Agreement and cause
Aerojet Rocketdyne to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Offer) if among other requirements (i)
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel, that an
Acquisition Proposal made to Aerojet Rocketdyne after the date of the Merger Agreement constitutes a Superior
Offer, (ii) Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation, or the failure to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept such Superior Offer, would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and
(iii) Aerojet Rocketdyne provides at least three business days’ prior written notice to Lockheed Martin and during
such period engages (to the extent requested by Lockheed Martin) in good faith negotiations with Lockheed Martin
to amend the Merger Agreement in such a manner that the failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation,
or the failure to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept such Superior Offer, would not be inconsistent
with the fiduciary obligations of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders
under applicable Delaware law.

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and
further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement by Aerojet Rocketdyne or Lockheed Martin under
certain circumstances, including due to a failure to secure approval of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders or Aerojet
Rocketdyne accepting a Superior Offer (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the Company will be required to pay
Lockheed Martin a termination fee of $150,000,000.

A U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend”) generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger in an
1
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger. Although the tax
treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not entirely clear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin intend to report
the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s common stock for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the amount of this distribution would be treated
first as a taxable dividend to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), then as a non-taxable return of
capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s basis in its Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, and finally as capital gain
from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has
certain connections to the United States. Assuming the Pre-Closing Dividend will be treated as a distribution with
respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty) with respect to the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend treated as a taxable dividend unless certain exceptions
apply. Since the determination of the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend that is treated as a taxable dividend will not
be completed until after the closing of the Merger, it is possible that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that
holds Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Holder may withhold at a rate of 30% (or
a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger and to the Pre-Closing Dividend in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising
under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction and any applicable
income tax treaty.",16,17

Except for a termination fee payable by Aerojet Rocketdyne in specified circumstances or with respect to a failure of
Aerojet Rocketdyne to pay a termination fee when due, Aerojet Rocketdyne, on the one hand, and Lockheed Martin
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, are each responsible for all of their own respective costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.
Aerojet Rocketdyne must pay to Lockheed Martin a termination fee of $150,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is
terminated in order to accept a Superior Offer and under certain other specified circumstances.

Date: March 9, 2021
Time: 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time
Place: The Special Meeting will be held entirely online at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM.
Record Date: You are entitled to vote if you were a
stockholder of record at the close of business on
February 4, 2021.
Purpose
At the virtual Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (1) adopt the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Merger Proposal”); (2) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or
dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”); and (3) approve, by a non-
binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aerojet Rocketdyne named
executive officers in connection with the Merger (the “Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation
Proposal”).
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 77,503,616 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. The stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding common stock of Aerojet Rocketdyne, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum at the Special Meeting.
Required Vote
Proposal 1:
Merger Proposal
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, a broker
non-vote, if any, and an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote against
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Proposal 2:
Adjournment
Proposal
Whether or not a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as
a vote against this proposal. A failure to vote your shares and broker non-votes, if any, will
have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Proposal 3:
Merger-Related
Named Executive
Officer Compensation
Proposal
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve, by a non-binding, advisory
vote, the Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal. Abstentions
will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. A failure to vote your shares and
broker-non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Since
compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided in connection with the Merger are
based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome of this
advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments and these payments
may still be made even if the stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Named
Executive Officer Compensation Proposal.
Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 1,921,729 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.48% of the shares of common stock
outstanding on the Record Date.

Trustee has received voting instructions. You must submit voting instructions to the Trustee by no later than March
4, 2021, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time in order for your shares to be voted as you have directed by the Trustee at the

If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are not adopted by stockholders, Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Aerojet
Rocketdyne will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
the NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we will
continue to file periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). However,
payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not conditioned on approval of the Merger. Under specified circumstances,
Aerojet Rocketdyne will be required to pay Lockheed Martin a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement. For more details, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Effect on Aerojet

No. 2:21-cv-01917, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Aerojet
Rocketdyne and the members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors (the“Coffman Action”). The Myers
Action, the Hiramitsu Action, the Feinhals Action, the Stein Action, the Clark Action and the Coffman Action are
collectively referred to as the “Actions.” The Actions allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) (and Rule
14a-9 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by, among other things, omitting certain allegedly
material information with respect to the Merger in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Aerojet Rocketdyne on
January 25, 2021. The Myers Action and the Feinhals Action also allege that the members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger, and the Myers Action further
alleges that Aerojet Rocketdyne aided and abetted the directors’ alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs in
the Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief, money damages and the costs of the Actions, including
reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees.
Aerojet Rocketdyne and the members of its board of directors disagree with and intend to vigorously defend against
the Actions. If the Actions are not resolved on a timely basis, the Actions could delay consummation of the Merger
and result in additional costs to Aerojet Rocketdyne, including costs associated with the indemnification of directors.
Additional plaintiffs may file lawsuits against Aerojet Rocketdyne and/or our directors and officers in connection
with the Merger.

Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that

Stockholders may submit questions in advance of the Special Meeting by visiting www.proxyvote.com and accessing
the online pre-meeting forum using the 16-digit control number found on such stockholder's proxy card or voting

Meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne will hold a live question and answer session during which we intend to answer
questions submitted in advance of and during the meeting that are pertinent to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the meeting
matters, as time permits. Questions may be submitted during the special meeting through
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM. Questions and answers will be grouped by topic and
substantially similar questions will be grouped and answered once.”
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD AND AS A
BENEFICIAL OWNER?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s transfer agent, Computershare, Inc.,
you are considered a “stockholder of record” or a “registered stockholder” of those shares. In this case, your proxy
materials have been sent to you directly by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. If your shares are held in a stock
brokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee or custodian, including shares you may own as a participant
in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of those shares,
which are held in “street name.” The proxy materials have been forwarded to you by or on behalf of your broker,
bank, trustee or other holder who is considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner,
you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other holder of record as to how to vote your shares by
following their instructions for voting.
WHAT ARE BROKER NON-VOTES AND HOW ARE THEY COUNTED?
Broker non-votes occur when nominees, such as brokers and banks holding shares on behalf of the beneficial
owners, are prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided
voting instructions at least ten days before the Special Meeting. If no instructions are given within that time frame,
the nominees may not vote those shares on matters deemed “non-routine” by the NYSE. The proposals for
stockholder consideration herein are non-routine matters and nominees cannot vote without instructions from the
beneficial owner. These so-called “broker non-votes,” if any, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal 1
and no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2 and Proposal 3. Broker non-votes are not counted for the purposes of
determining the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy on a voting matter. For these reasons,
please promptly vote by telephone, or Internet, or mail.
MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE?
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting
by:
•
Returning a signed proxy card bearing a later date;
•
Sending written notice of revocation to the Company, c/o the Secretary;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 1)?
Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to
give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 2)?
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, present or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting, is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.
The Special Meeting may also be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting for a proper purpose or by the
stockholders for any other purpose per Aerojet Rocketdyne’s bylaws.
WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER-RELATED NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER
COMPENSATION PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 3)?
Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock,
present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, is required to
approve the Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal (Proposal 3). The stockholders’ vote
regarding Proposal 3 is a non-binding, advisory vote. Since compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided
in connection with the Merger are based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome
of this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments and these payments may still be made
even if the stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal.
WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUORUM?
As of the Record Date, 77,503,616 shares of common stock were outstanding. A majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, represented individually or by proxy, will constitute a quorum. Shares
represented by a proxy that directs that the shares abstain from voting or that a vote be withheld on a matter will be
included at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes. Shares represented by proxy as to which no voting
instructions are given as to matters to be voted upon will be included at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes.
WHAT IS THE COMPANY’S INTERNET ADDRESS?
The Company’s Internet address is www.AerojetRocketdyne.com. You can access this proxy statement at this
Internet address, as well as all other Company filings with the SEC.
The Company will provide free of charge a print copy of the proxy materials to any beneficial owner of the
Company’s common stock as of the Record Date who sends a written request to:

WILL ANY OTHER MATTERS BE VOTED ON?
As of the date of this proxy statement, our management knows of no other matter that will be presented for
consideration at the Special Meeting other than those matters discussed in this proxy statement. If any other matters
properly come before the Special Meeting and call for a vote of the stockholders, validly executed proxies will be
voted in accordance with the recommendation of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors.
WHO IS SOLICITING PROXIES UNDER THIS PROXY STATEMENT?
The proxies being solicited hereby are being solicited by our board of directors. The cost of soliciting proxies in the

mailings, personal conversations, by telephone, facsimile, or electronic means. The Company will, upon request,

"AEROJET ROCKETDYNE HOLDINGS, INC._20210205_DEFM14A_19007640_4113036.Pdf",Merger Related Q & A,"MERGER RELATED Q & A
WHAT IS THE MERGER?
On December 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Lockheed Martin in an all-cash
transaction, which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement” throughout this proxy statement. The acquisition will be
implemented by the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin with and into Aerojet Rocketdyne, with
Aerojet Rocketdyne surviving that merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.
WHAT WILL HOLDERS OF AEROJET ROCKETDYNE COMMON STOCK RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?
If the Merger is completed, holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive $56.00 per share in cash, without
interest and less, to the extent paid or payable as discussed further in this proxy statement, the $5.00 per share
amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend, unless the holder properly exercises their appraisal rights. This $56.00 per share
amount represents a premium of approximately 33% to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s closing stock price on December 18,
2020 (the last trading day before the announcement of the Merger Agreement), and a premium of approximately 42%
to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s volume weighted average stock price in the 90 trading days prior to announcement of the
Merger Agreement.
WHAT WILL HOLDERS OF AEROJET ROCKETDYNE OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,
RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?
At the effective time of the Merger, and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement:
•
Outstanding unvested shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s restricted common stock will automatically become
fully vested (for shares subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum
performance) and cashed out as specified in the Merger Agreement promptly following the effective time of
the Merger.
•
Each outstanding option and SAR with respect to shares of our common stock that have an exercise price
or grant price, as applicable, that is less than the Price Per Share will be automatically canceled and cashed
out.
•
Each outstanding option and SAR with exercise or grant prices equal to or greater than the Price Per Share
will be canceled for no consideration.
•
Each outstanding restricted stock unit (for units subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed
achievement of maximum performance), to the extent granted prior to the execution of the Merger
Agreement, will be automatically canceled and, upon delivery of a notice and acknowledgment, cashed out
as specified in the Merger Agreement within ten business days following the effective time of the Merger
or at such other time or times to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income taxes
under Section 409A of the Code.
•
Each outstanding restricted stock unit with respect to shares of our common stock that was granted on or
after the execution of the Merger Agreement will be automatically canceled. With respect to each cancelled
restricted stock unit, (i) for individuals who remain employed by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates through
the applicable grant date of such replacement award, Lockheed Martin will grant a replacement award of
Lockheed Martin restricted stock units based on the total number of shares of our common stock subject to
such cancelled restricted stock units (for units subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed
achievement of maximum performance) multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) or (ii) for individuals who do not remain
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
employed by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates through the applicable grant date of the replacement awards
referenced in the immediately preceding clause (i), Lockheed Martin will pay an amount in cash as specified
in the Merger Agreement within ten business days following such holder’s termination of employment.
WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in
the second half of 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the
Merger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Merger,” many of which are outside of our control.
IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, HOW WILL I RECEIVE THE CASH FOR MY SHARES?
The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly after the effective time of the Merger, a designated paying agent will
send each holder of record of a certificate representing shares of common stock or of uncertificated shares of
common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger a customary letter of transmittal and instructions
advising such holder as to how to surrender or transfer such shares of common stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. The paying agent will promptly pay such holders the Merger Consideration upon (i) the surrender of a
certificate representing shares of common stock to the paying agent (or compliance with the reasonable procedures
established by the paying agent for transfer of uncertificated shares) and (ii) delivery of a properly completed letter of
transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the paying agent or Lockheed Martin. Interest will not
be paid or accrue in respect of cash payments. The amount of any cash payments paid to you will be reduced by any
applicable withholding taxes.
You should not surrender your shares of common stock without a letter of transmittal.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - Payment for the Shares.”
AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER DELAWARE LAW?
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of Proposal 1 (adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby) and who properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
“DGCL”). This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Stockholders who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to
the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising
appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement.
WILL I BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX UPON THE EXCHANGE OF COMMON STOCK FOR
CASH PURSUANT TO THE MERGER?
If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend”), the exchange of common stock for
cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will
require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has
certain connections to the United States.
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend.” We recommend that you consult your own tax advisor
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in light of your own particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or
foreign taxing jurisdiction and any applicable income tax treaty.
DO ANY OF AEROJET ROCKETDYNE’S DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER
THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE COMPANY’S STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY?
In considering the recommendation of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt
Proposal 1 (adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby), you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of stockholders generally, including golden parachute payment mitigation actions, payments upon
termination following a change-in-control, cashing out of equity-based awards held by our directors and executive
officers and continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers. In (i)
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors was
aware of and considered these interests, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”

"AEROJET ROCKETDYNE HOLDINGS, INC._20210205_DEFM14A_19007640_4113036.Pdf",Dividend Related Q & A,"DIVIDEND RELATED Q & A
IS PAYMENT OF THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND CONTINGENT ON APPROVAL OF THE MERGER?
No. On December 19, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors declared a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per
share payable on March 24, 2021 to stockholders of record of common stock as of the close of business on March 10,
2021. Payment of this Pre-Closing Dividend is not conditioned on approval of the Merger.
DOES THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION I WILL RECEIVE IN THE
MERGER?
Yes. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, the $56.00 per share price will be reduced
by the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing Dividend to the extent it is paid prior to closing or payable after closing. As a
result:
•
If the Merger closes before the close of business on March 10, 2021, which we do not expect to be the case,
no dividend will be paid to stockholders and stockholders will receive $56.00 in cash per share of common
stock at the closing. In this situation, no dividend will be paid to stockholders because all shares of our
common stock will have been canceled prior to the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date.
•
If the Merger closes after the close of business on March 10, 2021, but before payment of the Pre-Closing
Dividend on March 24, 2021, which we do not expect to be the case, stockholders will receive $51.00 in cash
per share of common stock in consideration at closing. In this situation, the Merger Agreement provides
that, on March 24, the Surviving Corporation will pay the $5.00 per share dividend to stockholders of
record as of the close of business on March 10, 2021.
23TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
If the Merger closes after the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend on March 24, 2021, as we expect will be
the case, stockholders will receive $51.00 in cash per share of common stock in consideration at closing. In
this situation, stockholders of record as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date will have already received
the $5.00 per share dividend by the effective time of the Merger.
WILL I BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND?
Although the tax treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not entirely clear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed
Martin intend to report the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the amount of this distribution
would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of a U.S. Holder’s (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing
Dividend”) pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for
U.S. federal income tax purposes), then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s basis in its
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock.
Assuming the Pre-Closing Dividend is treated as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common shares
for United States federal income tax purposes, a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend”)
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty) with respect to the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend treated as a taxable dividend unless certain
exceptions apply. Since the determination of the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend that is treated as a taxable
dividend will not be completed until after the closing of the Merger, it is possible that a broker, dealer, bank or other
custodian that holds Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Holder may withhold at a
rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend.” We recommend that you consult your own tax advisor
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Pre-Closing Dividend to you in light of your own particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or
foreign taxing jurisdiction and any applicable income tax treaty.

We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in
the second half of 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the
Merger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Merger,” many of which are outside of our control.
Appraisal Rights
Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) entitles certain stockholders to exercise appraisal rights in connection with
the Merger. Holders of shares of our common stock who qualify for, and have properly exercised, their appraisal
rights are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash
of the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair
value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The procedures established by Section 262 must be complied with exactly. Due to the complexity of the appraisal
process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of common stock are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal
should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the
same as or less than the value of the Merger Consideration.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL, including: (i)
delivering a written demand for appraisal to Aerojet Rocketdyne before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) not submitting a proxy or otherwise voting in
favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (iii) continuing
to hold your shares of our common stock of record through the effective time of the Merger. Your failure to follow
exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. If you hold your
shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights,
you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee. The DGCL requirements for exercising
appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 regarding appraisal rights is
reproduced and attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement
and the Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding

contemplated thereby. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting
instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or

Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from stockholders that have previously returned
properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby.
Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn
the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the

CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on
an advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
- Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control” and “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Payment Mitigation.”
We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable
to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various
plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed part
of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been
disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual
proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors, which is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to
be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control” and “The
Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden
Parachute Payment Mitigation” in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s proxy statement for the Special Meeting.”
Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote,
the result will not be binding on Aerojet Rocketdyne, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors or Lockheed Martin.
Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to
stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated,
our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the advisory approval of certain Merger-related
executive compensation arrangements.

If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not adopted by the stockholders, Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Aerojet
Rocketdyne will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the
SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner
similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks
and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in
which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be
completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever,
the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s board of directors will continue to evaluate and review Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business operations,
strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger
is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s board of directors will be offered or that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business, prospects or results of
operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be required to pay to Lockheed Martin a termination fee of $150,000,000 if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. For more information, please see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees and
Expenses.”

On December 19, 2020, the Company’s board of directors declared a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per share of
common stock. The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021 to each stockholder of record of common
stock as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors has the authority to
modify, suspend, cancel or revoke the Pre-Closing Dividend prior to the Payment Date, but has no expectation of
doing so. The Merger Agreement provides that if the Merger closing date occurs after the Pre-Closing Dividend
Record Date but before the Dividend Payment Date, which we do not expect to be the case, the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger shall pay, and Lockheed Martin will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the Pre-
Closing Dividend to each stockholder of record of common stock as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date. If the
Pre-Closing Dividend is paid or payable before the closing of the Merger, as we expect will be the case, stockholders
will receive $51.00 per share of common stock in connection with the consummation of the Merger, reflecting the
$56.00 per share Merger consideration price less the amount of the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing Dividend. If the Pre-
Closing Dividend is not paid or payable before the closing of the Merger, stockholders will receive the $56.00 per

The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, with the assistance of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, regularly
evaluates Aerojet Rocketdyne’s prospects and strategy in light of its performance, the business and economic
environment, as well as developments in the aerospace and defense industries, and opportunities and challenges
facing Aerojet Rocketdyne and other participants in such industries, all with a view toward maximizing stockholder
value. These reviews have included, among other things, consideration of potential strategic alternatives, including
the possibility of strategic acquisitions, divestitures and business combination transactions, as well as other uses of
company resources, including potential recapitalization transactions and other capital deployment transactions.
Aerojet Rocketdyne has for many years served as a supplier to United Launch Alliance (“ULA”), a joint venture
between Lockheed Martin and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). ULA currently provides launch services using the
Atlas and Delta launch vehicles, which both use Aerojet Rocketdyne-made rocket engines. In light of the nature of
the businesses of Aerojet Rocketdyne and each of Lockheed Martin, Boeing and ULA and the commercial
relationship between Aerojet Rocketdyne and each of those companies, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne
management are generally familiar with those other companies’ businesses, and representatives of Aerojet
Rocketdyne have periodically discussed Aerojet Rocketdyne’s commercial relationships with ULA with
representatives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
On January 28, 2020, Gregory A. Jones, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Development of Aerojet
Rocketdyne, contacted representatives of Boeing regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s potential interest in a strategic
business combination involving Boeing’s Space and Launch division and/or Aerojet Rocketdyne’s acquisition of
Boeing’s interest in ULA. During February and March 2020, Mr. Jones had additional discussions with
representatives of Boeing concerning Aerojet Rocketdyne’s potential interest in any such potential transaction.
On March 18, 2020, Mr. Jones contacted Mr. Robert E. Mullins, Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and
Business Development of Lockheed Martin, and Mr. Jones indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne might have potential
interest in acquiring ULA. During this call, the discussion expanded into a broader discussion about the strategic
relationship between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and the possibility of a potential business
combination involving the two companies. Later that day, Mr. Jones informed Warren G. Lichtenstein, Executive
Chairman of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Eileen P. Drake, Chief Executive Officer and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne,
about this discussion with Lockheed Martin.
During April 2020, Mr. Jones had several discussions with Mr. Mullins and Mr. Gregory L. Psihas, Vice President,
Corporate Development of Lockheed Martin, regarding the possibility of a potential business combination involving
Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin.
In April 2020, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management began to have discussions with representatives of Citi
regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s potential retention of Citi as a financial advisor to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the
Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors to assist in analyzing an array of potential business and financial
35TABLE OF CONTENTS
matters, including a possible strategic transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne and other strategic alternatives.
Thereafter members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management and representatives of Citi engaged in a number of
discussions regarding various business and financial matters.
On April 14, 2020, Boeing informed Aerojet Rocketdyne that no decision had been made or was expected to be made
in the foreseeable future to either divest their 50% equity ownership interest in ULA or pursue a possible strategic
combination involving Aerojet Rocketdyne, given Boeing senior leadership’s increasing attention being devoted
towards the impact of COVID-19.
On May 4, 2020, Mr. Jones and Mr. Psihas had a telephone call during which Mr. Psihas confirmed Lockheed Martin’s
interest in continuing preliminary discussions with Aerojet Rocketdyne concerning a potential business combination
transaction and the timing for potential next steps in the process, including the execution of an appropriate
confidentiality agreement between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and a potential management
presentation by Aerojet Rocketdyne with respect to its business and operations. Later that day, Mr. Jones provided
Mr. Psihas with a draft confidentiality agreement prepared by Arjun L. Kampani, Senior Vice President, General
Counsel and Secretary of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On May 6, 2020, as part of a regularly-scheduled meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Mr. Jones
provided a summary to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors of his various discussions with Lockheed Martin
and Boeing, and noted that Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin agreed that a confidentiality agreement would
be appropriate in order to facilitate further discussions with Lockheed Martin.
On May 19, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin entered into a confidentiality agreement (the
“Confidentiality Agreement”) that included, among other things, customary confidentiality provisions and a 15-
month standstill provision prohibiting Lockheed Martin from engaging in certain types of actions, including making
any acquisition proposal with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne (subject to certain exceptions), except that the
Confidentiality Agreement did not restrict Lockheed Martin from initiating and engaging in private discussions with,
and submitting certain confidential proposals to, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. The Confidentiality
Agreement also provided that the standstill provisions would terminate and be of no further effect upon the
occurrence of certain fundamental change events.
On May 20, 2020, certain members of management of Aerojet Rocketdyne (including Ms. Drake, Mr. Jones, Paul R.
Lundstrom, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-current Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Kampani, and Mark Tucker, Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s then-current Senior Executive and former Chief Operating Officer) and representatives of Citi
participated in a conference call with certain members of Lockheed Martin’s management team (including Mr. Psihas),
various representatives from Lockheed Martin’s financial advisors, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”)
and Ardea Partners LP (“Ardea”), and representatives of Hogan Lovells US LLP (“Hogan Lovells”), legal advisor to
Lockheed Martin. During this meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management provided a presentation on Aerojet
Rocketdyne, which included an introduction to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s executive management team, a review of
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business, strategy and operations and a review of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Management
Presentation Forecast (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73), which was Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-current 10-year
financial forecast and which was subsequently updated and superseded by a new forecast in the latter half of
September 2020. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” for a summary of this Management Presentation Forecast as well as other later forecasts.
Over the course of the next few weeks, continuing into June 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi provided
additional information, through written responses to questions and during conference calls, to Lockheed Martin and
its representatives, including Goldman Sachs, Ardea and Hogan Lovells. In connection with that process,
representatives of Citi had multiple discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Ardea.
In June 2020, Mr. Lichtenstein had a discussion with representatives of Evercore regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
potential retention of Evercore as an additional financial advisor to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors to assist in analyzing an array of potential business and financial matters, including potential
recapitalization transactions and other strategic alternatives. Thereafter and continuing into July 2020, Mr.
Lichtenstein and representatives of Evercore had various discussions regarding various business and financial
matters. Other members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management also began to have preliminary discussions with
representatives of Evercore in late July 2020 regarding business and financial matters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the week of July 6, 2020, Ms. Drake had a telephone call with Frank A. St. John, Chief Operating Officer of
Lockheed Martin, to follow up on prior discussions and to inquire whether Lockheed Martin intended to submit a
transaction proposal to Aerojet Rocketdyne regarding a business combination transaction.
On July 14, 2020, Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas provided Ms. Drake, Mr. Jones and Mr. Lundstrom a presentation
regarding Lockheed Martin’s views regarding the strategic rationale, strategic fit and valuation of a potential
business combination transaction between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin, and a preview of Lockheed
Martin’s preliminary merger proposal. The presentation described Lockheed Martin’s view that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
revenues would grow at a substantially lower rate than was included in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-year revenue
projections included in the Management Presentation Forecast. The presentation also indicated that while the loss of
Aerojet Rocketdyne profits on certain sales to Lockheed Martin as a result of government procurement laws would
have a negative impact on the value of the combined entity, Lockheed Martin had been able to identify significant
cost and revenue synergy opportunities, which could potentially offset the profit loss. During this presentation, the
Lockheed Martin management team indicated that Lockheed Martin would be submitting to Aerojet Rocketdyne an
indication of interest letter for an all-cash merger transaction at $47.50 per share.
Following the presentation, Mr. Jones called Mr. Psihas and indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne was extremely
disappointed in Lockheed Martin’s $47.50 price per share offer and was not prepared to present it to the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors, as Aerojet Rocketdyne management believed that the offer was opportunistic based
on the recent stock market downturn and significantly undervalued Aerojet Rocketdyne in light of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s business, prospects and position in the aerospace and defense industry. During this discussion, Mr.
Psihas indicated to Mr. Jones that the indication of interest letter had already been sent.
The indication of interest letter from James D. Taiclet, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lockheed Martin, that
was delivered to Ms. Drake set forth a preliminary, non-binding proposal for the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne in
an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $47.50 per share. The letter identified key elements of context for Lockheed
Martin’s diligence review and valuation framework with respect to a potential acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
Among other things, Lockheed Martin reiterated the negative financial implications of the loss of Aerojet
Rocketdyne profits on sales to Lockheed Martin as a result of government procurement laws and its expectation that
there would be both cost and growth synergies available to Lockheed Martin to offset this economic reality.
Lockheed Martin also noted that there was long-term uncertainty in the Space Launch System (“SLS”) program of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) as well as uncertainty regarding the number of
hypersonics programs that ultimately would be funded through production. Aerojet Rocketdyne did not formally
respond in writing to the letter. Aerojet Rocketdyne management consulted with representatives of Citi in connection
with these matters.
In mid-July 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and its management team began to analyze and focus on one or more potential
capital deployment transactions as alternatives to a strategic business combination transaction with Lockheed
Martin or any other company.
Between July 14 and August 4, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi engaged in discussions with
Lockheed Martin management and Lockheed Martin’s financial advisors regarding Lockheed Martin’s proposal and
the significant gap between the respective valuations of Aerojet Rocketdyne by Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed
Martin. During these discussions, Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi provided additional information
concerning Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and prospects.
On August 4, 2020, Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas provided an updated presentation to Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones, and
indicated that Lockheed Martin would be delivering a revised merger proposal for an all-cash merger transaction at
$52.00 per share. While Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas noted that the increased price reflected Lockheed Martin’s better
understanding of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and financial forecast, they also noted that the price continued to
reflect uncertainty regarding the SLS program and the number of hypersonics programs that would be funded over
the next 10 years. During this discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne management team noted to Mr. St. John and Mr.
Psihas that they were again disappointed in Lockheed Martin’s $52.00 per share offer, and that they believed it was
still opportunistic, inadequate and not sufficient to merit making a counterproposal or engaging in a negotiation, but
they indicated a willingness to provide certain additional financial information on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s strategic plan
and the Management Presentation Forecast.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the presentation, a letter from Mr. Taiclet was delivered to Ms. Drake setting forth a revised preliminary, non-
binding proposal for the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne in an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $52.00 per
share. Except for the proposed price per share, this August 4, 2020 letter was otherwise substantially similar to Mr.
Taiclet’s July 14, 2020 letter. Aerojet Rocketdyne management consulted with representatives of Citi concerning the
terms of this revised proposal.
On August 5, 2020, at a regularly-scheduled meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Mr. Jones
presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors information regarding the indication of interest letter that
Aerojet Rocketdyne had received from Lockheed Martin on July 14, 2020 proposing an all-cash merger transaction at
$47.50 per share, the subsequent discussions that Aerojet Rocketdyne management and Citi had with Lockheed
Martin and its advisors during the past several weeks regarding the significant gap in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s and
Lockheed Martin’s respective valuations of Aerojet Rocketdyne, the revised indication of interest letter Aerojet
Rocketdyne received from Lockheed Martin on August 4, 2020 proposing an all-cash merger transaction at $52.00 per
share and Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s views that Lockheed Martin’s latest offer was still inadequate. Mr.
Jones also presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors information about various Aerojet Rocketdyne
strategic alternatives, including Aerojet Rocketdyne’s organic growth plan, potential inorganic growth opportunities
through acquisitions, and the likelihood that various potential merger and acquisition targets might be available to
Aerojet Rocketdyne. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
management’s assessment of Lockheed Martin in comparison to other companies potentially interested in a business
combination with Aerojet Rocketdyne and management’s view that Lockheed Martin represented the best fit for
Aerojet Rocketdyne from a business, synergy and timing perspective. Management reviewed with the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors management’s views that (1) Company A, while potentially a good fit, had timing
restrictions, (2) Company B, while potentially a good fit, had timing issues due to various business challenges and
had other priorities, (3) Company C, while a moderate fit, was focused on other business areas and had low synergy
potential, (4) Company D had some product overlap and unclear interest in the defense business, and (5) Company E
had timing issues due to various business challenges and had low synergy potential. After discussion, the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors confirmed that the $52.00 per share price offer from Lockheed Martin was inadequate
and not sufficient to merit making a counterproposal or engaging in a negotiation with Lockheed Martin, and the
Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors instructed management to proceed with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s organic growth
plan while continuing to seek out and assess opportunities under its inorganic acquisition growth plan and consider
the timing of potentially approaching any other parties that might have potential interest in a strategic transaction
involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. Management noted that it would reassess any revised indication of interest that
Lockheed Martin might submit in the future, at a higher price per share, and report on its analysis of any such revised
indication of interest.
On August 7, 2020, Mr. Jones again communicated to Mr. Psihas that Lockheed Martin’s $52.00 per share offer was
inadequate and not sufficient to merit making a counterproposal or engaging in a negotiation. Aerojet Rocketdyne
did not otherwise respond to this letter, but Mr. Jones indicated to Mr. Psihas in the conversation that Aerojet
Rocketdyne believed that a price of at least $60.00 per share was justified. Aerojet Rocketdyne management then
continued to focus on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s organic growth plan, potential capital deployment transactions and
other alternatives to a strategic business combination transaction.
Over the next couple of weeks, members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne senior management team, representatives of Citi
and representatives of Lockheed Martin and its financial advisors engaged in discussions regarding Lockheed
Martin’s revised proposal from August 4, 2020 and the remaining significant gap between the respective valuations
of Aerojet Rocketdyne by Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin. Mr. Jones also provided further information
about Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and prospects to Mr. Psihas.
On August 14, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas, and Mr. St. John
and Mr. Psihas presented Lockheed Martin’s views on various matters relating to a potential business combination
transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin.
Between August 14, 2020 and August 17, 2020, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management met with
representatives of Citi and two other financial advisors to conduct an assessment of the market, and Aerojet
Rocketdyne management received feedback from representatives of Citi and the other two financial advisors

TABLE OF CONTENTS
regarding the likelihood that certain potential strategic buyers of Aerojet Rocketdyne would be interested in a
strategic transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne. During this time, Mr. Lichtenstein also had conversations with senior
executives at Company A, Company C and Company D regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and prospects.
On August 18, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors increased its size from seven to eight members and
appointed Audrey A. McNiff as a director.
On August 27, 2020, Ms. Drake, Mr. Jones, Mr. Kampani, Tyler Evans, Senior Vice President, Defense Business Unit,
James Maser, Senior Vice President, Space Business Unit, and other members of Aerojet Rocketdyne senior
management had a discussion with and provided additional information to Mr. St. John, Mr. Psihas and other
members of Lockheed Martin’s management team concerning Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business, including its
hypersonics and space exploration-related businesses. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also described additional
emerging business opportunities that could potentially add, over a 10-year period, $500 million more revenue, and
associated profit and cash flow, to the Management Presentation Forecast that was previously provided in May 2020.
These additional opportunities were subsequently incorporated into the Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s Base
Case Forecast (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73) for Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business for the years 2020
through 2029, which was provided to Lockheed Martin on September 18, 2020.
On August 31, 2020, Mr. Lichtenstein, Ms. Drake and other members of Aerojet Rocketdyne senior management had
a telephone call with Kenneth R. Possenriede, Chief Financial Officer of Lockheed Martin, Mr. St. John and Mr.
Psihas, during which Mr. Lichtenstein indicated that Lockheed Martin’s latest $52.00 per share price proposal was not
sufficient and expressed a view that Aerojet Rocketdyne could be reasonably valued at a price of at least $60.00 per
share based on Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s then-current view of the Management Presentation Forecast as
discussed during the August 27 discussion. During this conversation, Mr. Lichtenstein and members of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s senior management provided further insights into Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and prospects and
their views about the inadequacy of the price offered pursuant to Lockheed Martin’s two prior indication of interest
letters. During the call, Mr. Psihas indicated that Lockheed Martin continued to have a differing view of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s 10-year revenue projections in the Management Presentation Forecast.
During September and the first half of October 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management continued to evaluate,
consider and, in one case, implement various alternatives to a strategic business combination transaction. Aerojet
Rocketdyne management was focused on the effective utilization of the substantial amount of cash on its balance
sheet, and therefore gave careful consideration to potential deployment of cash for alternative strategies, including
the deployment of capital for a special dividend, redemptions and repurchases of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outstanding
convertible notes, a tender offer for shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock and repurchases of shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program that had been approved by the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors in March 2020, as well as the possibility of potential acquisitions by Aerojet
Rocketdyne of other businesses. From time to time during this period, Aerojet Rocketdyne sought advice from
outside advisors regarding these strategic actions, including financial advice from two financial advisory firms and
legal advice from its outside securities counsel, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (“Gibson Dunn”) and Morrison &
Foerster LLP (“Morrison & Foerster”), and its outside mergers and acquisitions and governance counsel, Jenner &
Block LLP (“Jenner & Block”).
Between September 2 and September 14, 2020, Ms. Drake had several telephone calls with Mr. St. John, during which
they discussed the parties’ respective positions on valuation and other issues relating to the terms and conditions of
any potential transaction. On one of these calls on September 14, 2020, Mr. St. John informed Ms. Drake that the
upper range of Lockheed Martin’s assessment would not reach $60.00 per share. Ms. Drake reiterated the difference
of views the two companies had on valuation. She indicated that she had no authority to negotiate below $60.00 per
share. She further indicated that, if there were a compelling offer, she would take it to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board
of directors for consideration. Mr. St. John indicated that he would discuss the matter further with the Lockheed
Martin board of directors later that month.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, on September 4, 2020, Mr. Jones had a conversation with a senior executive from Company A regarding a
potential business combination transaction, as a follow-up to the conversation that Mr. Lichtenstein had with
Company A in mid-August 2020. Mr. Jones was informed by that senior executive that Company A was not in a
position to pursue a potential business combination involving Aerojet Rocketdyne at this time.
On September 9, 2020, Citi and Lockheed Martin’s financial advisors from Goldman Sachs and Ardea had a call to
discuss their respective approaches to the calculation of transaction multiples for a potential business combination
transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin and other comparable transactions.
On September 18, 2020, Mr. Jones delivered an updated set of Aerojet Rocketdyne financial projections to Mr. Psihas.
These updated financial projections consisted of Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s Base Case Forecast (as defined
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”
beginning on page 73) for Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business for the years 2020 through 2029, which was based upon
and reflected, among other things, an assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would ramp up from one launch per
year to two launches per year beginning in 2028. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger -
Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73 for more information about these
projections. The Base Case Forecast was an update of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-year Management Presentation
Forecast, with the addition of $500 million more revenue, and associated profit and cash flow, over the 10-year period
from the emerging opportunities that were discussed between Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin on August
27, 2020. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Jones had a telephone discussion with Mr. Psihas during which Mr. Jones reviewed
the Base Case Forecast in further detail. At the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne management, Citi also delivered a
copy of the Base Case Forecast to Goldman Sachs and Ardea.
On September 30, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas, during which
Mr. St. John communicated a revised indication of interest from Lockheed Martin proposing an acquisition of Aerojet
Rocketdyne in an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $56.00 per share, with the same non-price terms and
conditions as had been communicated in Lockheed Martin’s August 4 letter. Mr. St. John also noted that there would
be no financing contingency and that the proposal had the full support of the Lockheed Martin board of directors.
From October 2020 through December 2020, various members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors had
various meetings and calls from time to time with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management and, at times,
representatives of Citi, representatives of Evercore, representatives of Jenner & Block and/or representatives of
Gibson Dunn. A range of strategic and other matters were discussed from time to time with various members of the
Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors including valuation matters, assessments of strategic alternatives to a
business combination transaction involving Lockheed Martin, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s standalone business plan and
strategy, the terms and conditions of a potential transaction involving Lockheed Martin, regulatory matters, and
fiduciary considerations.
On October 2, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. St. John had another telephone call to discuss the parties’ respective
positions on valuation and other issues relating to the terms and conditions of any potential transaction involving
the two companies.
On October 8, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and certain
members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting. Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones updated the
Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors regarding the further indication of interest communicated by Lockheed Martin
to Ms. Drake on September 30 for an all-cash merger transaction at a price of $56.00 per share. In describing the
further indication of interest, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones noted that while the $56.00 per share price offered had been
authorized by the Lockheed Martin board of directors, they believed that it may not represent Lockheed Martin’s
best and final offer, thus potentially leaving room for further negotiation of price. Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones then
provided a detailed review of Lockheed Martin’s proposed terms and recapped for the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors the timeline of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s discussions with Lockheed Martin to date. In connection with this
meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors was provided with (1) the Base Case Forecast and (2) a more
conservative set of financial projections consisting of Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s Adjusted Base Case
Forecast (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” beginning on page 73) for Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business for the years 2020 through 2029
(which was based upon and reflected an assumption that the NASA
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
SLS manifest would remain at about one launch per year). See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73 for more information about the
Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast.
At this meeting, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones then presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an overview
of the anticipated strategic opportunities and benefits from a potential combination with Lockheed Martin, along
with, among other things, an analysis of (1) Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-year Base Case Forecast and Adjusted Base
Case Forecast, (2) valuation matters and (3) potential Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne synergy
opportunities. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also noted to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
management’s view about increasing uncertainty related to NASA’s SLS launch manifest and human space
exploration program. Aerojet Rocketdyne management also presented a preliminary downside risk-based sensitivity
analysis relating to the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, which downside analysis assumed that NASA’s schedule for
landing a human presence on the moon could potentially be delayed and that space exploration-related new business
might not be funded or won at the same rate assumed in the Adjusted Base Case Forecast.
Aerojet Rocketdyne management then presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors information about
various potential strategic combination alternatives, including Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s assessment of
Lockheed Martin in comparison to other companies that might potentially be interested in a business combination
with Aerojet Rocketdyne and management’s view that Lockheed Martin continued to represent the best fit for
Aerojet Rocketdyne from a business, synergy and timing perspective. Management reviewed with the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors management’s views that (1) Company A, while potentially a good fit, had timing
restrictions and had communicated that it was not in a position to pursue a transaction, (2) Company B, while
potentially a good fit, had timing issues due to various business challenges and had other priorities, (3) Company C,
while a moderate fit, was focused on other business areas and had low synergy potential, (4) Company D had some
product overlap and no interest in the defense business, and (5) Company E had timing issues due to various
business challenges and had low synergy potential.
At this same meeting, Daniel L. Boehle, who had been appointed Chief Financial Officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne in
August following Mr. Lundstrom’s departure, then presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors multiple
potential recapitalization and capital deployment alternatives Aerojet Rocketdyne could consider in lieu of a strategic
business combination transaction with Lockheed Martin or another company, including the redemption of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s currently outstanding convertible notes and share repurchases. In connection with this discussion,
Mr. Boehle presented information on the status of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s share repurchase program, an overview of
the terms of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outstanding convertible notes and a number of potential refinancing alternatives
for the notes, including a full or partial redemption of the notes using Aerojet Rocketdyne’s cash on hand, a
redemption of the notes using the proceeds of a new convertible note offering, term loan, high yield bond or other
debt issuance, or a privately-negotiated repurchase of a portion of the notes from various holders, and presented an
overview of the pros and cons of these various potential alternatives. Management then presented various valuation
models for various potential recapitalization scenarios, including a potential future sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne
following a recapitalization. Mr. Kampani provided to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors a summary of their
fiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of these matters. Throughout these presentations the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors asked questions and discussed the issues. After further discussion, the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors directed that Aerojet Rocketdyne management provide further information about the
assumptions and uncertainty underlying the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, a review of
various strategic transactions Aerojet Rocketdyne could potentially consider and a review of potential
recapitalization and other capital deployment alternatives that Aerojet Rocketdyne could consider in lieu of a
strategic transaction.
On October 13, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again to, among other things, receive an update
from Aerojet Rocketdyne management about the matters requested at its October 8, 2020 meeting. All Aerojet
Rocketdyne directors and certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting. Mr.
Jones discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors further information about the modeling assumptions
underlying Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-year Adjusted Base Case Forecast and an Aerojet Rocketdyne management
valuation model based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, each as previously presented to the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors at its October 8, 2020 meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne management then presented in further detail its
views regarding various growing risk factors and other
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
uncertainties present even in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-year Adjusted Base Case Forecast, particularly the current
human space exploration budgetary environment, management’s view of the increasing uncertainty related to
NASA’s SLS launch manifest, potential future competition and uncertainties associated with a potential new
Presidential administration. Management then provided additional information about the outlook for Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s Defense Business Unit. Mr. Jones then discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an
assessment of a possible sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Space Business Unit and Defense Business Unit operations in
separate transactions. Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones then discussed Aerojet Rocketdyne’s proposed formal engagement
of Citi and Evercore as financial advisors, the advisors’ relevant experience and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s proposed
approach for the structuring of their respective fees and other terms and conditions of their engagements.
At this meeting, management then reviewed (1) the views of representatives of Citi and Evercore regarding the
likelihood that certain other companies would have interest in a strategic transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne,
(2) Mr. Lichtenstein’s preliminary conversations earlier in the year with senior executives at Company A (who
subsequently communicated that it was not in a position to pursue a transaction), Company C and Company D
regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and prospects and (3) the potential of performing a more explicit market test
(and related risks of leaks and any potential impact on the ongoing discussions with Lockheed Martin). Management
also reviewed a summary of the material potential transaction terms and conditions proposed by Lockheed Martin
and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s contemplated positions with respect to those terms and conditions, based on further
assessment of the risks and uncertainties associated with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s forecasts in view of changing
circumstances. Mr. Kampani then reviewed a preliminary regulatory assessment of a potential transaction with
Lockheed Martin, and management discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors potential negotiation
strategies for engaging with Lockheed Martin, with a view towards achieving an offer of a higher price per share.
At this meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne management then further reviewed various business, financial and legal
considerations relating to potential recapitalization transactions and other capital deployment alternatives that
Aerojet Rocketdyne could consider pursuing in lieu of a strategic business combination. Management’s review
addressed, among other things, various mechanisms and legal requirements relating to a redemption of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s outstanding convertible notes, various legal requirements and other considerations relating to
privately-negotiated repurchases of the notes, mechanisms and legal requirements relating to a tender offer for
Aerojet Rocketdyne shares, and considerations relating to the Aerojet Rocketdyne share repurchase program and
other share repurchases. Management also discussed valuation, timing and other risks, uncertainties and
considerations relating to any decision to defer a potential business combination transaction (including a potential
transaction with Lockheed Martin) until after the completion of a recapitalization transaction, and various other
disclosure and other legal considerations relating to a potential recapitalization transaction. Mr. Kampani reminded
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors of its fiduciary obligations in connection with consideration of the matters
discussed at this meeting and reviewed various fiduciary considerations.
It was at this meeting that the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors confirmed, based on its assessment of the
relative risks and uncertainties associated with its business (particularly management’s view of increasing
uncertainty related to NASA’s SLS launch manifest and potential shifting priorities in space exploration under a
potential new Presidential administration) and available alternative capital deployment and other strategies, that
Aerojet Rocketdyne should shift its focus to pursue in earnest a transaction involving Lockheed Martin, but at a
higher price than currently offered at that time by Lockheed Martin. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors also
determined that it would be useful to have the benefit of multiple advisory perspectives, including in respect of
valuation matters, the market generally and other companies potentially interested in a business combination
transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. Throughout these presentations the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors asked questions and discussed the issues. After discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
then directed that management (1) review further with the assistance of outside advisors any financial and legal
considerations regarding a potential near-term recapitalization or other capital deployment transaction, (2) pursue in
earnest the possibility of a transaction with Lockheed Martin and begin negotiations to seek a higher price than
Lockheed Martin’s September 30 indication of interest, based on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-current belief that $56.00
per share may not represent the best and final offer from Lockheed Martin, and (3) finalize the terms
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s formal engagement of each of Citi and Evercore as financial advisors and have those
advisors review with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors their respective preliminary financial analyses of
Aerojet Rocketdyne and potential strategic alternatives to a potential business combination with Lockheed Martin.
On October 14, 2020, Mr. Kampani conferred with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside securities counsel at Gibson Dunn
and Morrison & Foerster regarding legal considerations pertaining to recapitalization and other transactions, as well
as other matters. Management of Aerojet Rocketdyne also consulted with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial advisors
regarding financial considerations relating to recapitalization and other transactions that Aerojet Rocketdyne might
consider.
On October 15, 2020, Mr. St. John contacted Ms. Drake to inform her that the Lockheed Martin board of directors
would be meeting on October 23, 2020, and that the Lockheed Martin board of directors would want Lockheed Martin
to either begin confirmatory due diligence on Aerojet Rocketdyne or move on to other strategic initiatives.
On October 17, 2020 and October 19, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into engagement letter agreements with Citi
and Evercore, respectively.
On October 18, 2020, Mr. St. John contacted Ms. Drake to reiterate that Lockheed Martin’s latest offer of $56.00 per
share was at the top end of its valuation.
On October 19, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and
certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi and
Evercore attended portions of the meeting. Mr. Lichtenstein commented on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s transaction review
process and provided an update regarding the engagement of Citi and Evercore as financial advisors.
Representatives of Citi and Evercore then reviewed their respective preliminary financial analyses of Aerojet
Rocketdyne, as well as their views on other potential buyers of Aerojet Rocketdyne. A discussion then ensued
among the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management and the financial
advisors regarding the analyses presented, and strategic considerations in terms of next steps in the transaction
process and further discussions with Lockheed Martin regarding a potential transaction. Management of Aerojet
Rocketdyne also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors management’s plan to commence
negotiations with Lockheed Martin on price and submit a non-binding counterproposal for a $60.00 per share
transaction that would involve (1) Lockheed Martin’s issuance of $55.00 per share of Lockheed Martin stock at
closing (subject to a 10% collar) in exchange for each share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock and (2) Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s payment of a $5.00 per share cash dividend shortly after public announcement of the transaction,
subject to further discussion amongst both parties’ advisors concerning the allocation of regulatory approval risk
and other key transaction terms. The dividend was intended to accelerate the delivery of cash to Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholders prior to a transaction closing. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors authorized management to
submit the proposed non-binding counterproposal to Lockheed Martin. At the meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors also approved and ratified the engagement of Citi and Evercore. Prior to approving and ratifying
those engagements, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors considered the written disclosures from Citi and
Evercore, respectively, regarding their respective material relationships with Lockheed Martin.
On October 20, 2020, Ms. Drake spoke with Mr. St. John via telephone and communicated Aerojet Rocketdyne’s non-
binding counterproposal that had been approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors the previous day as
detailed in the prior paragraph. Ms. Drake followed up with a letter that same day to Mr. St. John that further
described the terms and conditions of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s non-binding counterproposal. The letter also noted that
at this price, Aerojet Rocketdyne would consider a break-up fee at the higher end of the customary range. The letter
further indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne sought Lockheed Martin stock as consideration because it believed in the
prospects for success of the combined businesses and because equity, rather than cash, consideration would
provide a tax advantage for Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders. Finally, the letter noted that an appropriate efforts
provision and appropriate remedial commitments from Lockheed Martin related to regulatory review would need to be
included in the merger agreement and that a customary “fiduciary out” provision would also need to be included in
the merger agreement.
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 21, 2020, Mr. St. John contacted Ms. Drake to inform her that Lockheed Martin had reviewed her letter
and that the counterproposal was not acceptable, including the contemplation of stock as a form of consideration.
Mr. St. John also reiterated that Lockheed Martin would not agree to a $60.00 per share price and that the only path to
continue discussions would be if the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors could support a transaction at a price
below $60.00 per share.
Later that day on October 21, 2020, Ms. Drake spoke by telephone with Mr. St. John, who again relayed Lockheed
Martin’s disappointment that Aerojet Rocketdyne had not reduced its required price below $60.00 per share. Ms.
Drake asked Mr. St. John to take the Aerojet Rocketdyne counterproposal to the Lockheed Martin board of directors,
and Mr. St. John indicated that if Aerojet Rocketdyne was not willing to make any price movement he would
communicate to the Lockheed Martin board of directors that discussions may come to an end.
On October 22, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met and was provided an update on the current state
of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s discussions with Lockheed Martin. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and certain members
of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi and Evercore attended
a portion of the meeting. Ms. Drake provided details on her latest discussions with Lockheed Martin, including
Lockheed Martin’s rejection of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s October 20 counterproposal, and the Aerojet Rocketdyne board
of directors discussed whether to continue to pursue negotiations with Lockheed Martin or consider other initiatives.
Representatives of Citi and Evercore then discussed their views on potential next steps in the transaction process
and further discussions with Lockheed Martin and other transaction-related considerations.
On October 24, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and
certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi,
Evercore and Jenner & Block attended portions of the meeting. Management discussed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors various transaction structuring and related considerations, including appropriate remedial
commitments from Lockheed Martin pertaining to regulatory matters that could be included in a merger agreement.
Mr. Kampani provided to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors a summary of their fiduciary duties, and
representatives of Jenner & Block further commented on the directors’ fiduciary obligations in the context of their
consideration of any potential transactions. Representatives of Jenner & Block also commented on transaction
structuring matters and deal terms considerations. After further discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors unanimously authorized management to submit to Lockheed Martin a non-binding counterproposal for a
$58.00 per share (50% cash and 50% stock) transaction containing the following terms: (1) allowance for Aerojet
Rocketdyne to issue up to a $5.00 cash dividend (which would reduce the purchase price on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the amount of the dividend); (2) a ticking fee of $0.25 per share per month if regulatory approval would exceed six
months from signing; and (3) the stock consideration portion of the purchase price would be subject to a +/- 10%
collar (with a floating exchange ratio within the collar and fixed exchange ratio outside the collar).
On October 26, 2020, Ms. Drake delivered a letter to Mr. St. John communicating Aerojet Rocketdyne’s revised non-
binding counterproposal that had been approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors on October 24,
including the financial terms as outlined in the prior paragraph. The letter also communicated information relating to
the capitalization of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On October 26, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. St. John discussed Ms. Drake’s October 26 letter to Mr. St. John. Mr. St. John
stated that he was unable to commit to accepting a price of $58.00 per share, but he would take the proposal to the
Lockheed Martin board of directors. Mr. St. John indicated that any dividend payment would need to reduce the
purchase price on a dollar-for-dollar basis and that he was opposed to Lockheed Martin issuing stock as part of the
merger consideration.
On October 30, 2020, Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. Psihas, during which Mr. Psihas indicated that
Lockheed Martin would be sending a letter to Aerojet Rocketdyne reflecting their best and final offer of $56.00 per
share. Later that day on October 30, 2020, Mr. Taiclet delivered to Ms. Drake a letter setting forth an updated non-
binding acquisition proposal from Lockheed Martin. The letter indicated that Lockheed Martin was not prepared to
proceed based on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s most recent counterproposal, and that Lockheed Martin wished to make a
final attempt to communicate the basis on which Lockheed Martin was prepared to proceed with a transaction. The
letter stated that it replaced in its entirety the earlier proposals included in Lockheed
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Martin’s letters dated July 14, 2020 and August 4, 2020, and superseded the views expressed by Mr. St. John in his
discussions with Ms. Drake on September 30, 2020. The letter stated that Lockheed Martin’s final proposal would be
an all-cash merger at a price of $56.00 per share, and that Lockheed Martin was not prepared to offer stock
consideration or to include a ticking fee. It did, however, state that Lockheed Martin was prepared to include
provisions giving Aerojet Rocketdyne the option of declaring a special cash dividend of up to $5.00 per share at the
time a transaction would be announced, and that if such a dividend was declared, the cash consideration at the
closing of the merger would be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the dividend. Similar to
Lockheed Martin’s July 14 and August 4 letters, the letter also identified key elements underlying Lockheed Martin’s
valuation framework with respect to a potential acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, including an explanation that
Lockheed Martin projected a lower growth rate for Aerojet Rocketdyne than was included in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
Base Case Forecast. The October 30, 2020 letter also outlined the remedies and restrictions to which Lockheed Martin
would be willing to agree in the context of regulatory approval of such a transaction.
On November 2, 2020, Ms. Drake and Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas regarding the
terms of Lockheed Martin’s revised proposal and related matters.
On November 2, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and
certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting, and representatives of Citi,
Evercore and Jenner & Block attended portions of the meeting. Ms. Drake provided the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors an update on Mr. Lichtenstein’s and Ms. Drake’s recent discussions about desirable parameters of a
potential counterproposal of $57.00 per share that Aerojet Rocketdyne could make to Lockheed Martin in response to
its indication of interest for an all-cash merger transaction at $56.00 per share. Ms. Drake also provided an update on
her and Mr. Jones’ recent call with Mr. St. John and Mr. Psihas. Mr. Lichtenstein then provided a further overview of
discussions over the weekend among Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, representatives of Citi and Evercore and
other members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. Management then presented an overview and analysis
of Lockheed Martin’s current indication of interest at a $56.00 per share price, including a comparison of key metrics
of a potential Aerojet Rocketdyne / Lockheed Martin transaction at $56.00 per share to those metrics as reflected in
the 2018 Northrop Grumman / Orbital ATK transaction. Management also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors management’s views on increasing risks to and uncertainties associated with the Adjusted Base
Case Forecast, with a particular focus on growing uncertainties to Aerojet Rocketdyne regarding NASA’s Space
Exploration (Artemis) Program, including potential shifting priorities in space exploration under a potential new
Presidential administration. Aerojet Rocketdyne management reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors, among other things, (1) the fact that NASA’s Artemis-related business accounted for approximately 25% of
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s annual revenues, and (2) Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s view about increasing uncertainty
related to NASA’s SLS launch manifest and space exploration program and that the schedule for landing a human
presence on the moon could potentially be delayed, which schedule delay could result in greater competitive
pressure on Aerojet Rocketdyne from new competitive entrants into Aerojet Rocketdyne’s industry.
In connection with this meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors was provided with (1) another copy of
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-year Adjusted Base Case Forecast and (2) Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s Risk
Adjusted Case Analysis (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73), which represented a downside risk-based
sensitivity analysis prepared by Aerojet Rocketdyne management in respect of the Adjusted Base Case Forecast
taking into account Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s evolving and expanding view that there was growing
uncertainty in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s space exploration business prospects. See the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73. Aerojet
Rocketdyne management also reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 10-
year Adjusted Base Case Forecast and Risk Adjusted Case Analysis and Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s view
that a $56.00 per share price was at the top end of management’s valuation range based on the Risk Adjusted Case
Analysis and within management’s valuation range based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast.
Representatives of Citi and Evercore then reviewed their respective preliminary financial analyses of Aerojet
Rocketdyne, and a discussion ensued regarding the analyses presented, and strategy in terms of next steps with
Lockheed Martin. Mr. Kampani provided the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors a summary of their fiduciary
duties, and representatives of Jenner & Block further commented on the directors’ fiduciary obligations in the
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
context of a potential transaction, including by referencing prior discussions of these matters with the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors. A discussion of the proposed deal terms and conditions and required regulatory
approvals ensued, with representatives of Jenner & Block, Citi and Evercore commenting on such matters,
contemplated transaction execution timelines and other related items.
After further discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors unanimously approved management’s
recommendation to authorize Ms. Drake to submit to Lockheed Martin a non-binding counterproposal for an all-cash
transaction at a $57.00 price per share or, if such a higher price could not be achieved, a $56.00 price per share, with
any discussions and negotiations for a $56.00 per share transaction to include an Aerojet Rocketdyne request for a
lower break-up fee. In connection therewith, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors noted its belief that, in light
of its assessment of the value of Aerojet Rocketdyne, the substantial premium of each such price to Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s then-current trading price and its consideration of certain risks and uncertainties associated with
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s projected performance (particularly in the space exploration sector), either price would
represent a significant value enhancement for Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders and be in their best interests.
On November 3, 2020, Ms. Drake delivered a letter (dated November 2, 2020) to Mr. Taiclet communicating Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s latest non-binding counterproposal for a $57.00 per share all-cash merger transaction. The letter noted
that the merger agreement would need to include provisions giving Aerojet Rocketdyne the option of declaring a
special cash dividend of up to $5.00 per share at the time a transaction is announced, provided that if such a dividend
is declared and paid the cash consideration delivered to Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders at closing would be
reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such dividend. The letter also noted that Aerojet Rocketdyne
would want to include in the merger agreement appropriate efforts provisions and appropriate regulatory remedial
commitments from Lockheed Martin. The letter further indicated that Lockheed Martin would have no financing
contingency and that a customary “fiduciary out” provision would be included in the merger agreement.
On November 10, 2020, Ms. Drake contacted Mr. St. John by telephone to discuss the status of Lockheed Martin’s
consideration of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s latest proposal. Mr. St. John indicated that the Lockheed Martin management
team had engaged in numerous conversations, including with the Lockheed Martin board of directors, and that
Lockheed Martin management team believed that their previous $56.00 per share offer price remained at the high end
of the valuation range and that they were unable to change their valuation position. Ms. Drake reiterated the counter-
offer of $57.00 per share, but Mr. St. John stated that he was directed to send Aerojet Rocketdyne a letter affirming
their $56.00 per share offer.
On November 12, 2020, Ms. Drake received a letter (dated November 10, 2020) from Mr. Taiclet responding to Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s November 2, 2020 counterproposal. The letter noted that Lockheed Martin was prepared to proceed
with confirmatory due diligence and to negotiate a definitive merger agreement at an all-cash price of $56.00 on the
terms set forth in that letter. The letter also stated that Lockheed Martin’s price was firm and that it believed its
proposal reflected appropriately the risk to and uncertainty associated with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Base Case
Forecast. On that same date, Ms. Drake communicated to Mr. St. John that the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
would be meeting the next day.
On November 13, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held a meeting. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors
and certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management attended the meeting. Ms. Drake reviewed her
recent discussions with Mr. St. John and the recent letter she had received from Lockheed Martin, which indicated
that Lockheed Martin would only pursue a transaction at a price of $56.00 per share and that Lockheed Martin’s price
was firm. Management then reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors certain deal protection
provisions, including termination fee amounts, contained in various merger agreements for recent transactions
involving companies in the aerospace and defense industry. At this meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors confirmed that, consistent with its prior deliberations, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors was
prepared to move forward with an all-cash merger transaction with Lockheed Martin (with appropriate terms and
conditions) at a price of $56.00 per share. In connection therewith, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors noted
its belief that, in light of its assessment of the value of Aerojet Rocketdyne, the substantial premium of such price to
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-current trading price and its consideration of certain risks and uncertainties associated
with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s projected performance (particularly uncertainties in the space exploration sector), this
price would represent a significant value enhancement for Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders and be in their best
interests.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin then continued discussions based on an all-cash merger transaction at a
price of $56.00 per share with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors having the ability to declare a special cash
dividend of up to $5.00 per share (which dividend would reduce the per share purchase price on a dollar-for-dollar
basis), subject to the parties reaching agreement on other terms and conditions of a potential transaction.
On November 14, 2020, Mr. Jones had a telephone call with Mr. Psihas to discuss various key terms and provisions to
be contained in the merger agreement, including Lockheed Martin’s required remedial measures related to regulatory
clearance, the “no-shop” and “fiduciary out” provisions, and related break-up fee provisions.
On November 16, 2020, members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management and members of Lockheed Martin management
had a further discussion concerning various key terms and conditions to be included in the merger agreement.
Among other things, Aerojet Rocketdyne indicated to Lockheed Martin that Aerojet Rocketdyne expected that the
merger agreement would contain a customary “fiduciary out” to any “no-shop” provision included in the merger
agreement. Aerojet Rocketdyne also proposed that the break-up fee that would be payable by Aerojet Rocketdyne
upon any termination of the merger agreement for certain customary events would be on the low end of the
customary range of break-up fees, measured as a percentage of equity value represented in the transaction. Lockheed
Martin responded that such a low break-up fee was not acceptable to it in light of the substantial premium it believed
was represented by its $56.00 per share offer price in relation to the recent trading prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne
stock.
On November 17, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block, Hogan Lovells and
McDermott, Will & Emery LLP (“McDermott Will”), antitrust counsel to Lockheed Martin, had a further discussion
about various key deal points, including the level of the break-up fee that was appropriate under the circumstances.
In the context of these discussions, a representative of Lockheed Martin indicated that if Aerojet Rocketdyne were to
contact other potential buyers at this time, Lockheed Martin would immediately terminate its merger discussions with
Aerojet Rocketdyne. The parties also discussed Lockheed Martin’s required efforts and remedial measures related to
regulatory clearance.
Later that same day on November 17, 2020, certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne management and the independent
members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors had a discussion with representatives of Citi, Evercore and
Jenner & Block to review the open material transaction terms and conditions and the status of the merger discussions
with Lockheed Martin, including Lockheed Martin’s refusal to accept Aerojet Rocketdyne’s request for a lower break-
up fee. The independent directors were further advised by Aerojet Rocketdyne management of Lockheed Martin’s
assertion that it would retract its offer and cease discussions if Aerojet Rocketdyne were to conduct any further
market check at this time. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial advisors also discussed their views regarding whether
certain companies in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s industry (including Company B) would likely be interested in pursuing a
potential business combination transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne. Based on this discussion and other information
previously reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, the independent directors believed that it was
unlikely that there were other viable counterparties for a potential business combination involving Aerojet
Rocketdyne. The independent directors and representatives of Citi and Evercore also discussed the risk that new
competitive entrants could disrupt Aerojet Rocketdyne’s industry, which could result in a negative impact on Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s business and standalone value. As part of this discussion, the independent directors also considered
the level of break-up fees in a number of recent merger transactions, including merger transactions in the aerospace
and defense industry. At this time, the independent directors of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
considered the level of a break-up fee in the context of any transaction involving Lockheed Martin and determined,
based on its consideration and evaluation of input from Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial and legal advisors, that a
break-up fee at the level proposed by Lockheed Martin fell within the generally acceptable range of customary break-
up fees and would not likely preclude a potentially superior proposal for the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On November 19, 2020, Mr. Psihas sent an email to Mr. Jones purporting to reiterate Lockheed Martin’s
understanding of various conversations over the past week on a number of items, including a price of $56 per share
(subject to dollar-for-dollar reduction for any dividend). Mr. Psihas’ email also noted that in order to facilitate
regulatory clearance for the proposed transaction, Lockheed Martin was prepared to take certain remedial measures if
necessary to obtain clearance, but that Lockheed Martin would not agree to a reverse break-up fee in the context of a
failure to obtain regulatory approval, which Aerojet Rocketdyne had proposed.
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The email also noted that Lockheed Martin expected a break-up fee at a level based on at least 3% of the equity value
of the transaction (including any special cash dividend that Aerojet Rocketdyne may declare), and that it anticipated
that the members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors would execute voting and support agreements and
that a similar voting and support agreement would be sought from one of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders, Steel
Partners Holdings L.P. (“Steel Partners”).
On November 20, 2020, Mr. Jones responded to Mr. Psihas that Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed that his email addressed
the parties’ prior discussions around the price and dividend and the general contours of antitrust-related covenants,
but rejected the requirement of voting and support agreements from Steel Partners and the Aerojet Rocketdyne
directors. Mr. Jones then outlined the process and timing of allowing Lockheed Martin to proceed with its
confirmatory due diligence and also noted that Aerojet Rocketdyne believed that the transaction process would best
be advanced by Lockheed Martin sending Aerojet Rocketdyne its proposed draft merger agreement, which Lockheed
Martin had previously indicated was in process, and that all remaining issues would need to be resolved in the
totality of the deal terms and conditions as embodied in the merger agreement.
Shortly thereafter, on November 20, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne provided various Lockheed Martin
representatives access to a virtual data room so that Lockheed Martin could begin its confirmatory due diligence.
During the course of Lockheed Martin’s confirmatory due diligence, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne had
various discussions with representatives of Lockheed Martin regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business, operations,
financial performance and financial outlook, including Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-current forecasts and related
uncertainties associated with NASA’s human space exploration program.
On November 30, 2020, Hogan Lovells delivered to Jenner & Block a draft Merger Agreement along with a draft of a
form of voting and support agreement, which Lockheed Martin indicated they expected would be executed by each of
the Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and Steel Partners.
On December 3, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block and Hogan Lovells
held a teleconference to discuss various key issues that Aerojet Rocketdyne and its representatives had identified
based on their review of the draft Merger Agreement and the draft form of voting and support agreement. The key
issues discussed included Lockheed Martin’s request that the Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and Steel Partners sign
voting and support agreements, the proposed terms of the “no-shop” covenant and related “fiduciary out” and other
provisions that would give the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors flexibility to comply with its fiduciary duties in
the event a third party were to submit a proposal for a potentially superior transaction, the proposed requirement that
Aerojet Rocketdyne redeem its outstanding convertible notes promptly after redemption becomes permissible under
the related indenture, the scope of Lockheed Martin’s remedial commitments related to regulatory review, the scope
of various Lockheed Martin termination rights, Lockheed Martin’s proposed $150 million termination fee and the
circumstances under which Aerojet Rocketdyne would become obligated to pay the termination fee, and the scope of
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s representations and warranties and interim operating covenants.
On December 5, 2020, Jenner & Block delivered to Hogan Lovells a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, reflecting
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s position on the key open issues.
On December 8, 2020, Hogan Lovells delivered to Jenner & Block a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, reflecting
Lockheed Martin’s response to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s positions on the issues.
On December 9, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block and Hogan Lovells
held a teleconference to discuss various key issues that Aerojet Rocketdyne and its representatives had identified
based on their review of the latest draft of the Merger Agreement. The key issues that were discussed included
Lockheed Martin’s continuing request that each of the Aerojet Rocketdyne directors (but no other stockholder) sign
voting and support agreements, the scope of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s representations and warranties, the proposed
scope and substance of the interim operating covenants, the proposed terms of the “no-shop” covenant and related
“fiduciary out” and other provisions that would give the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors appropriate flexibility
to comply with its fiduciary duties in the event a third party were to submit a proposal for a potentially superior
transaction, the proposed scope of remedial commitments related to regulatory review, the conditions to Lockheed
Martin’s obligation to close the Merger, the scope of various Lockheed Martin termination rights and Lockheed
Martin’s proposed $150 million termination fee and the circumstances under which Aerojet Rocketdyne would
become obligated to pay such a fee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 10, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met to consider the status of the potential
transaction. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors attended the meeting, and certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
senior management and representatives of Citi, Evercore and Jenner & Block attended portions of the meeting. Mr.
Jones provided an update on the transaction process and the status of Lockheed Martin’s confirmatory due diligence
review. Mr. Boehle and Mr. Kampani then provided an overview of the process and timing for the declaration and
payment of the $5.00 per share special cash dividend being contemplated in connection with the signing of the
Merger Agreement. Mr. Kampani then reviewed the status of the negotiations with Lockheed Martin on the proposed
Merger Agreement and the key terms and provisions reflected in the latest draft of the Merger Agreement, including
the “no-shop” and “fiduciary out” provisions, the interim operations covenants, Lockheed Martin’s closing
conditions and various termination and break-up fee payment provisions. Mr. Kampani also noted that Lockheed
Martin had not yet dropped its request that all members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors execute voting
and support agreements with Lockheed Martin in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement and that
further Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors discussion of the terms of such agreements may be needed if
Lockheed Martin continued to insist on those agreements as part of the Merger transaction. Mr. Kampani then
reviewed various regulatory considerations and the related provisions being negotiated in the Merger Agreement.
Andreas Wagner, Chief Human Resources Officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne, provided an overview of the employee
retention arrangements anticipated to be adopted in connection with the Merger Agreement and intended to help
ensure appropriate management continuity pending the closing of the Merger transaction. Throughout these
presentations the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors asked questions and discussed the issues. In an executive
session of this Board meeting, representatives of Jenner & Block also reviewed certain legal considerations in
connection with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ consideration of the Merger. This session included a
review and discussion of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ fiduciary obligations in connection with its
consideration of these matters, including deal protection terms that might be included in the Merger Agreement.
Following the executive session, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors directed Aerojet Rocketdyne
management to continue negotiating the Merger Agreement as discussed during the meeting.
On December 12, 2020, Jenner & Block delivered to Hogan Lovells a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, reflecting
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s position on the open issues.
On December 13, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin executed a Supplemental Confidentiality
Agreement Governing the Establishment of a “Clean Team,” effective as of December 6, 2020, by and between
Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin to set forth certain procedures and restrictions in respect of the sharing of
certain competitively sensitive information.
Also on December 13, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block and Hogan
Lovells had a lengthy negotiation session on the Merger Agreement. Key issues remaining unresolved after that
session included Aerojet Rocketdyne’s flexibility to issue equity and other compensatory awards to various
employees and officers in 2021, the scope and terms of a transaction bonus pool that Aerojet Rocketdyne would
issue in order to incentivize and reward employees through the closing of the Merger, the proposed terms of the “no-
shop” covenant and related “fiduciary out” and other provisions that would give the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors flexibility to comply with its fiduciary duties in the event a third party were to submit a proposal for a
potentially superior transaction, the scope of Lockheed Martin’s remedial commitments related to regulatory review,
certain conditions to Lockheed Martin’s obligation to close the Merger, the scope of various Lockheed Martin
termination rights and the circumstances under which Aerojet Rocketdyne would become obligated to pay a

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 16, 2020, representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Jenner & Block, Hogan Lovells and
McDermott Will had a number of telephone conferences to negotiate open issues relating to the Merger Agreement.
Several issues were resolved during these discussions, including the terms of the “no-shop” and “fiduciary out” and
other provisions designed to provide the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors appropriate flexibility to comply with
its fiduciary duties if a potentially superior proposal were to arise after the signing of the Merger Agreement and prior
to the receipt of the requisite stockholder vote, and Lockheed Martin withdrew its request that Aerojet Rocketdyne
directors execute voting and support agreements.
On December 17, 2020, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors met again to consider the status of the potential
Merger transaction. All Aerojet Rocketdyne directors, certain members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management
and representatives of Citi, Evercore and Jenner & Block attended the meeting. Mr. Jones provided an update on the
transaction process to date and the status of Lockheed Martin’s confirmatory due diligence review. Mr. Boehle and

Mr. Kampani then reviewed the proposed terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, focusing on the progress
made during the most recent rounds of negotiations, and the status of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s discussions with
Lockheed Martin, including the status of Lockheed Martin’s confirmatory due diligence process. A discussion
ensued, with questions asked and answered.
Representatives of Evercore then reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors Evercore’s financial
analysis of the merger consideration, and Evercore then rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
Evercore’s oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of December 19, 2020 and
based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s
opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-
Closing Dividend, to be received by holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock in the Merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger -
Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.” beginning on page 64. A discussion ensued, with questions asked and answered.
Representatives of Citi then reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors Citi’s financial analysis relating
to the fairness to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock of the merger consideration to be
received in the proposed Merger by such holders, and Citi then rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors Citi’s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 19, 2020, to the
effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as described in Citi’s written opinion,
the merger consideration of $56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing
Dividend, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. See the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” beginning on
page 57. A further discussion ensued, with questions asked and answered.
Representatives of Jenner & Block reviewed the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ fiduciary duties in
connection with their review and consideration of the Merger, and further commented on the process undertaken by
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in connection with its consideration of the proposed Merger transaction
over the course of this and prior meetings, as well as the proposed terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
including the deal protection provisions.
A further discussion of the proposed Merger transaction ensued, with questions asked and answered. During the
course of the meeting, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors considered carefully, in addition to the matters
described above, the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger, including the merger
consideration and the fact that the merger consideration constituted a substantial premium to the then-current
trading price and recent trading prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, among other items. During the course
of its deliberations at this and prior meetings considered the other matters described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger -
Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 52.
Following this discussion, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors unanimously, among other things, (1)
determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Aerojet Rocketdyne and its stockholders, and that it
is in the best interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its stockholders that Aerojet Rocketdyne enter into the Merger
Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (2)
approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and the performance by Aerojet Rocketdyne of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (3) directed
that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
stockholders, (4) recommended that the stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne vote in favor of adopting and approving
the Merger Agreement and the Merger, (5) approved the declaration and payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend,
subject to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ ability to modify or revoke the special cash dividend in its
discretion, and (6) approved the payment of such special cash dividend to the holders of record of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s outstanding convertible notes as of the dividend record date as if they held a number of shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock equal to the conversion rate set forth in the indenture governing the convertible
notes multiplied by the principal amount of convertible notes held by such holder, at
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the same time and upon the same terms as holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock without having to convert
their convertible notes. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors further authorized certain officers of Aerojet
Rocketdyne to take such further actions as may be necessary to finalize and execute the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.
Also on December 19, 2020, the Lockheed Martin board of directors held a meeting to consider and approve the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Following the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors meeting and the Lockheed Martin board of directors meeting,
the parties and their representatives worked to finalize the Merger Agreement and the related disclosure schedules
and to close out Lockheed Martin’s remaining confirmatory due diligence items. On the afternoon of December 20,
2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin executed the Merger Agreement, and thereafter each of Aerojet
Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin issued their respective separate press releases publicly announcing the execution
of the Merger Agreement.

52TABLE OF CONTENTS
In unanimously determining to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommend that
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders vote their shares of common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors also considered, during the course of its deliberations at its
December 19, 2020 and prior meetings, the material factors that are discussed below. The discussion in this section is
not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors, but rather includes the material factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. In view of
the wide variety of factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in connection with its evaluation
of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors did not consider it
practicable, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it
considered in reaching its decision. In addition, individual members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
may have given different weight to different factors. The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors made its
recommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors,
including discussions with, and questioning of, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management and legal counsel and financial
advisors.
The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors considered, among other things, the following factors as supporting its
decision to recommend that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement:
•
the per share merger consideration of $56.00, which is expected to be reduced to $51.00 per share after the
payment of the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing Dividend, constitutes a premium of:
○
33.2% over the closing price of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020
(the last trading day prior to the date the Merger Agreement was approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors);
○
35.7% over Aerojet Rocketdyne’s volume weighted average common stock price in the 30 trading days
prior to the date the Merger Agreement was approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors;
○
45.0% over Aerojet Rocketdyne’s volume weighted average common stock price in the 60 trading days
prior to the date the Merger Agreement was approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors;
○
42.5% over Aerojet Rocketdyne’s volume weighted average common stock price in the 90 trading days
prior to the date the Merger Agreement was approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors;
and
○
74.2% over Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 52-week intraday low trading price in the 52 weeks prior to the date
the Merger Agreement was approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors.
•
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ belief, based on discussions and negotiations among members
of Aerojet Rocketdyne senior management and representatives of Lockheed Martin, that the per share
merger consideration was the highest price that Lockheed Martin would be willing to pay for an acquisition
of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
Citi’s financial analysis relating to the fairness to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock of the merger consideration to be received in the proposed Merger by such holders, and Citi’s oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 19, 2020, to the effect
that, as of that date and based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as described in Citi’s
written opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per
share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” beginning on page 57;
•
Evercore’s financial analysis of the merger consideration and the oral opinion of Evercore, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing, rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors to the effect that,
as of December 19, 2020 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, to be received by
holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion of
Evercore Group L.L.C.” beginning on page 64;
•
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ and Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s assessment of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s present and future value on a standalone basis relative to the per share merger consideration
to be paid to Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders in the Merger, and information relating to such valuation
prepared by Aerojet Rocketdyne management and reviewed by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors;
•
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ belief, based on a review of the possible alternatives to a sale of
Aerojet Rocketdyne (including the prospects of continuing to operate in accordance with the existing
business plan or undertaking potential recapitalization or other alternatives, including the deployment of
capital for potential redemptions and repurchases of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outstanding convertible notes,
a tender offer for Aerojet Rocketdyne shares or other share repurchases, or undertaking other potential
strategic initiatives) and the timing and likelihood of actually achieving additional value for stockholders
from these alternatives, that none of these alternatives, on a risk- and time-adjusted basis, was reasonably
likely to create value for stockholders greater than the merger consideration for the proposed Merger;
•
the risks and uncertainties associated with continuing to operate independently as a public company
(including uncertainties associated with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s operations and business plan, such as the
current space exploration environment, potential budgetary reductions relating to NASA’s SLS program,
potential future competition from other companies in the space exploration industry and uncertainties
associated with a new Presidential administration);
•
the financial condition, results or operations and businesses of the Company, on both a historical and
prospective basis;
•
current industry, economic and market conditions and historical market demand and prices for Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s products and services;
•
the historical market prices, price to earnings multiples and recent trading patterns of the Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock;
•
the existing competitive and market position of Aerojet Rocketdyne, including the nature of the industries
in which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates;
•
certain challenges facing Aerojet Rocketdyne, including competition and potential future competition in
each part of its business from other industry participants;
•
discussions with senior management of Aerojet Rocketdyne and representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
financial advisors and legal counsel regarding the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement;
•
whether there were other potential parties that would likely have an interest in engaging in a strategic
transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
the fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash (which provides certainty of value and
liquidity to stockholders and does not expose them to any future risks and uncertainties related to the
business or the financial markets generally, as compared to a transaction in which stockholders receive
equity or other securities, or as compared to Aerojet Rocketdyne remaining independent);
•
the fact that the price Lockheed Martin will pay to Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders was the result of
extensive negotiations, as described above in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger -
Background of the Merger”;
•
the fact that the Merger is not subject to approval by Lockheed Martin’s stockholders;
•
the fact that the Pre-Closing Dividend may be paid to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders regardless of
whether the Merger is completed;
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the provisions of the Merger Agreement, including:
○
the flexibility afforded to Aerojet Rocketdyne to declare and pay the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing
Dividend which, while expected to reduce the per share merger consideration payable at closing from
$56.00 per share to $51.00 per share, provides short-term liquidity to Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholders;
○
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors’ ability to furnish information to, and engage in negotiations with, third parties that make an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors
determines, after consultation with an independent financial advisor and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Offer, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement - No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals” beginning on page 107;
○
the $150 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, which the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors believed, after consultation with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s legal counsel and financial
advisors, was acceptable, appropriate under the circumstances and not likely to preclude a Superior
Offer;
○
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s ability, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement and execute a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Offer, as long as Aerojet Rocketdyne pays Lockheed Martin the $150 million termination fee;
○
the right of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors under certain circumstances, subject to
compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to withdraw or modify, or resolve,
agree or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’
recommendation or declaration of advisability with respect to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
○
provisions of the Merger Agreement giving Aerojet Rocketdyne sufficient operating flexibility to
conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice between the execution of the
Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger;
○
the fact that the consummation of the Merger is not conditioned on Lockheed Martin’s ability to
secure financing; and
○
the fact that the conditions to the closing of the Merger are limited in scope;
•
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ belief that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
taken as a whole, provide a reasonable expectation that required regulatory approvals will be obtained,
based on, among other things:
○
the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement obligating each of the parties to use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated and to resolve objections under applicable
antitrust laws, subject to limitations on Lockheed Martin’s obligations, among other things, to (1)
litigate with any governmental authorities to oppose enforcement actions or remove court or
regulatory orders impeding the ability to consummate the Merger and (2) divest certain businesses or
assets of Aerojet Rocketdyne in order to obtain required regulatory approvals; and
○
the provision of the Merger Agreement that allows the outside date for completing the Merger to be
extended to March 21, 2022 if the Merger has not been completed by the initial December 21, 2021
outside date because the required regulatory approvals have not been obtained;
•
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ belief that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
taken as a whole, including, among other things, the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants,
and the conditions to the parties’ respective obligations, are reasonable and appropriate under the
circumstances;
•
the fact that a vote of Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders is required under the DGCL to adopt the Merger
Agreement;
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders who object to the Merger to seek to obtain a different value
for their shares if they exercise and perfect their appraisal rights under Delaware law; and
•
the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ belief that the Merger represents the best strategic alternative
reasonably available to Aerojet Rocketdyne and its stockholders and that the merger consideration payable
to holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock is the best value reasonably available to such
stockholders.
In the course of its deliberations, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors also considered a variety of risks,
uncertainties and other countervailing factors related to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including, among
other things, the following factors:
•
the per share merger consideration of $56.00, which is expected to be reduced to $51.00 per share after the
payment of the $5.00 per share Pre-Closing Dividend, constitutes a discount of 2.2% under Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s 52-week intraday high trading price in the 52 weeks prior to the date the Merger Agreement
was approved by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors;
•
the possibility that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure of the
conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, with respect to the required
approvals of the Merger by antitrust regulatory authorities;
•
the limitations on Lockheed Martin’s obligations to (i) litigate with any governmental authorities to oppose
enforcement actions or remove court or regulatory orders impeding the ability to consummate the Merger
and (ii) divest certain businesses or assets of Aerojet Rocketdyne in order to obtain required regulatory
approvals;
•
the fact that the Merger may not be completed unless and until the conditions specified in the Merger
Agreement are satisfied or waived (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Merger” beginning on page 116);
•
the potential risks and costs to Aerojet Rocketdyne if the Merger is not consummated, or is not
consummated in a timely manner, including, among other things, the potential distraction of management
and employee attention during the pendency of the Merger, employee attrition, the possible impact on
customer relationships, the potential effect on existing relationships with other parties, and the impact that
the failure of the Merger to close could have on the trading price of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s operating results (including the costs incurred in connection with the Merger)
and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s ability to maintain sales;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger,
which may delay or prevent Aerojet Rocketdyne from undertaking certain business opportunities, such as
material acquisitions or divestitures;
•
the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and delays in connection with obtaining the regulatory
approvals necessary for the completion of the Merger;
•
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict Aerojet Rocketdyne’s ability to solicit from a third
party an acquisition proposal to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne or to engage in discussions or negotiations
with third parties regarding an acquisition proposal to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne, in the latter case unless
(1) in response to an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal that did not result from a material
breach of the no solicitation provision of the Merger Agreement, (2) the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel and
an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such unsolicited acquisition
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer, (3) the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors determines in good faith, after considering the advice of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne under Delaware law, and (4) Aerojet
Rocketdyne complies with various other terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ ability to
withdraw or modify its recommendation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger in response to a Superior
Offer or Change in Circumstances (as defined below) unless (1) the Aerojet Rocketdyne board
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders under applicable Delaware
law and (2) various other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement are complied with and satisfied;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger, including in connection with any litigation that may result from the announcement or pendency of
the Merger, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated Aerojet Rocketdyne may be required to bear
such costs;
•
the fact that receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock pursuant to the Merger would generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend” beginning on page 90); and
•
the fact that the all-cash consideration, while providing relative certainty of value, would prevent Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholders from having an ongoing equity interest in Lockheed Martin, meaning that
stockholders will not participate in Lockheed Martin’s potential revenue or earnings growth, including any
growth or share gains with current customers, and any increase in demand from customers in the industries
in which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates.
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors also considered (1)
the prior relationships between Citi and Lockheed Martin that Citi disclosed to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors, as described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup
Global Markets Inc.,” (2) the fact that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in
the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders generally,
including those interests that are a result of employment and compensation arrangements with Aerojet Rocketdyne,
as described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and (3) the process undertaken by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors in considering and evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Merger and potential alternatives thereto,
including the number of, and quality of deliberation occurring at, meetings held by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors and the fact that many of those meetings included executive sessions with only the directors in attendance
and/or special executive sessions with only the independent directors in attendance.
This explanation of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors’ reasons for recommending the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read
in light of the factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements”
beginning on page 16.
The Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” (1) the Merger
Proposal, (2) the Adjournment Proposal and (3) the Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation
Proposal.

Aerojet Rocketdyne retained Citi to provide financial advisory services in connection with a possible transaction
involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. In connection with Citi’s engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors
requested that Citi evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock of the merger consideration to be received in the proposed Merger by such holders
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On December 19, 2020, at a
meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the proposed Merger, Citi rendered to the
Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion,
dated December 19, 2020, to the effect that, as of the date of Citi’s written opinion and based on and subject to
various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review
undertaken by Citi as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share minus, to the extent
paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock.
57TABLE OF CONTENTS
The full text of Citi’s written opinion, dated December 19, 2020, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, which
sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex
B and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi’s opinion set forth below is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of Citi’s opinion. Citi’s opinion was rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board
of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger and was limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock of the merger consideration. Citi’s opinion did not address any other terms, aspects or implications
of the proposed Merger or the Merger Agreement. Citi’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision
of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect the proposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as compared to any
alternative business strategies that might have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any other transaction
in which Aerojet Rocketdyne might have engaged. Citi’s opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the
proposed Merger or otherwise.
In arriving at its opinion, Citi:
•
reviewed a draft, dated December 17, 2020, of the Merger Agreement;
•
held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Aerojet
Rocketdyne concerning the business, operations and prospects of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
examined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne as
well as the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast (collectively, the “Aerojet
Rocketdyne Forecasts,” as defined and summarized in the section in this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73) and other
information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne which were provided to or discussed with Citi by the
management of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
reviewed the financial terms of the proposed Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,
among other things, current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock, historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the
capitalization and financial condition of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citi
considered relevant in evaluating the proposed Merger;
•
analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses
of other companies whose operations Citi considered relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
and
•
conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial,
economic and market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.
The issuance of Citi’s opinion was authorized by Citi’s fairness opinion committee.
In rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed
by or discussed with Citi, and upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not
aware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With respect to each of the
Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that such
forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future financial performance of Aerojet
Rocketdyne under the scenario reflected therein.
Citi assumed, with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the proposed Merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without
waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining
the necessary regulatory or third-party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed Merger, no delay,
limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Merger meaningful to
its opinion and analysis. Representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne advised Citi, and Citi further
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
assumed, with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the final terms of the Merger
Agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citi. Citi did not make and was not
provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Aerojet
Rocketdyne nor did Citi make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Citi was not
requested to, and it did not, solicit third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of
Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor was it requested to consider, and Citi’s opinion did not address, the underlying business
decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect the proposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as
compared to any alternative business strategies that might have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any
other transaction in which Aerojet Rocketdyne might have engaged. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi’s
opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the proposed Merger, or any class of such
persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Citi’s opinion was necessarily based upon information
available to Citi, and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date of its
opinion. The credit, financial and stock markets, the industries in which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates, and the
securities of Aerojet Rocketdyne have experienced and may continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no
view or opinion as to any potential effects of such volatility on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger.
In preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described
below. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Citi arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and factors assessed as a
whole, and it did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for
purposes of its opinion.
In its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions
and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne or the
Merger, and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect
the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed or the results of
any particular analysis.
The estimates used by Citi for purposes of its analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the
value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Citi’s
analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
Citi was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in the Merger.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed Merger was determined through negotiations
between Aerojet Rocketdyne, on the one hand, and Lockheed Martin and its affiliates, on the other hand, and
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board
of directors. Citi’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in
its evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors or the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne with respect to the proposed Merger, merger
consideration or any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared for and reviewed with the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors in connection with Citi’s opinion, dated December 19, 2020, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by, and underlying the opinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent
the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses

TABLE OF CONTENTS
by Citi. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables
below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the financial analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial
analyses. Future results may be different from those described, and such differences may be material. Approximate
implied equity value per share reference ranges derived from the financial analyses described below and other per
share ranges presented for reference purposes only were rounded to the nearest $0.25, except for data relating to
intraday trading share prices. Except as otherwise noted, financial data utilized for Aerojet Rocketdyne in the financial
analyses described below were based on the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast as indicated
and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or discussed with Citi and approved for
Citi’s use by Aerojet Rocketdyne and as further summarized in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 73. For purposes of the financial
analyses described below, the term “EBITDA,” when used with respect to any company, other than Aerojet
Rocketdyne, generally refers to that company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
expenses; the term “adjusted EBITDA,” when used with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne, generally refers to EBITDA
excluding EBITDA attributable to its real estate segment and income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net
environmental remediation asset/liability.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Citi conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Aerojet Rocketdyne using the Base Case Forecast and the
Adjusted Base Case Forecast. For each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, Citi calculated a range of present
values (as of September 30, 2020) of the estimated unlevered after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was
forecasted to generate under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2020 through the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2029 (such cash flows referred to as the
“projected cash flows”). For purposes of this analysis, the projected cash flows provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management were adjusted with management’s approval to exclude the impact of cash pension contributions and
reimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows and real estate cash flows (collectively, the “additional
cash flow items”). The additional cash flow items were excluded from the projected cash flows on the basis that they
are significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of cash pension
contributions and reimbursements was reflected as a liability on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s balance sheet, and each of the
net environmental cash flows and real estate cash flows were reflected as assets. For purposes of this analysis, stock
based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Citi also calculated a range of estimated terminal values for
Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity
growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated terminal year unlevered after-tax free cash flows
(excluding the additional cash flow items) under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts. The illustrative range of
perpetuity growth rates applied was selected by Citi based on its professional judgment and experience. The range of
estimated terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts was then
discounted to present values (as of September 30, 2020) and added to the estimated present values of the projected
cash flows under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts in order to derive ranges of implied adjusted firm values
for Aerojet Rocketdyne under that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts.
In calculating the ranges of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne, Citi discounted the projected cash
flows and estimated terminal values using discount rates ranging from 7.8% to 9.0%. Citi derived this range of
discount rates based on a calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of Aerojet Rocketdyne it performed
utilizing the capital asset pricing model with inputs that Citi determined were relevant based on publicly available data
and Citi’s professional judgment.
From the range of implied adjusted firm values it derived under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, Citi
subtracted Aerojet Rocketdyne’s reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2020 (calculated as debt, excluding
in-the-money convertible debt, plus the tax-effected net present value of net Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”)
reimbursements and cash pension contributions/other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) payments, less cash,
cash equivalents, a range of tax-effected net present values of real estate cash flows and reported net environmental
asset/(liability)), and divided the results by the number of shares of Aerojet

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rocketdyne common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method and
treating in-the-money convertible debt as converted to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, based on
information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne management. The net present value of net CAS reimbursements and
cash pension contributions/OPEB payments was calculated by discounting CAS reimbursements and cash pension
contributions/OPEB payments reflected in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts using, at the direction of Aerojet
Rocketdyne management, a 2.7% after tax cost of debt and 0% perpetuity growth rate. The range of tax-effected net
present values of real estate cash flows was calculated by discounting projected cash flows from real estate provided
by Aerojet Rocketdyne management using a range of discount rates of 7.8% to 9.0%, which Citi derived from a
calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of Aerojet Rocketdyne. This analysis indicated the following
approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25)
under the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, as compared to $56.00 per share:

Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Citi performed an analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock as of December 18, 2020 based on theoretical future prices calculated by Citi for the shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock under each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast. Citi derived
a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock as of December 31
of each of 2021, 2022 and 2023 using each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast. For each
set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, Citi derived this range of theoretical future values per share by (i) applying
illustrative one year forward adjusted firm value to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined, and as calculated as described, in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”)
multiples of 9.5x to 10.9x to estimates of the Adjusted EBITDA of Aerojet Rocketdyne for each of calendar years 2022,
2023 and 2024, as reflected in that set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts, (ii) adjusting the resulting range of firm
values to a range of equity values by subtracting Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated net debt and other for each period
ending as of December 31 (calculated as estimated debt, excluding in-the-money convertible debt, plus estimated tax
effected unfunded pension/OPEB liability, less estimated cash, cash equivalents, mid-point estimate of tax effected
net present value of real estate cash flows and estimated net environmental asset/(liability)), and (iii) dividing the
resulting range of equity values by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method and treating in-the-money convertible debt as
converted to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne
management. The firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples used by Citi were derived based on Citi’s professional
judgment and experience and taking into account historical firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples of Aerojet
Rocketdyne during the period from December 18, 2018 through December 18, 2020. By applying a discount rate of
8.7%, reflecting a mid-point estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s cost of equity, Citi discounted to present value as of
December 18, 2020 the theoretical future values per share it derived for Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Forecasts, to yield under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts a range of illustrative present values
per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share
equity value reference range for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25) under each of the Base Case
Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, as compared to $56.00 per share:

Selected Public Companies Analysis
Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the nine publicly
traded companies listed below whose operations, for the purposes of Citi’s analysis and based on its experience and
professional judgment, Citi considered generally relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on
business sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics (such companies collectively, the
“selected companies”).
For the selected companies, Citi calculated and reviewed, among other information, firm values (calculated as fully
diluted market equity value, plus net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests, and less unconsolidated
investments and non-operating assets, as applicable) as multiples of estimated calendar year 2021 EBITDA. All
calculations in this review were based on closing share prices on December 18, 2020 and, with respect to the selected
companies, financial data (pro forma as applicable) were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts’
estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Citi also calculated and reviewed the adjusted firm
value of Aerojet Rocketdyne as a multiple of its estimated Adjusted EBITDA of Aerojet Rocketdyne for calendar year
2021, based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates, as well as based on the Base Case Forecast
and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast. The estimated calendar year 2021 EBITDA multiples observed for the selected
companies and for Aerojet Rocketdyne were as follows:

Based on the multiples calculated and observed for the selected companies as described above and its professional
judgment and experience, Citi identified and applied a selected illustrative range of firm value to calendar year 2021
EBITDA multiples of 11.2x to 13.2x to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated calendar year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, reflected
in each of the Base Case Forecasts and the Adjusted Base Case Forecasts, to derive a range of implied adjusted firm
values for Aerojet Rocketdyne under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts. Citi subtracted from the range of
implied adjusted firm values it derived under each set of Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2020 (calculated as debt, excluding in-the-money convertible debt,
plus tax effected reported unfunded pension/OPEB liability, less cash, cash equivalents, mid-point estimate of tax
effected net present value of real estate cash flows and reported net environmental asset/(liability)) and divided the
results by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated
using the treasury share method and treating in-the-money convertible debt as converted to shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne management. This analysis

Selected Transactions Analysis
Using publicly available information, Citi reviewed certain financial data relating to the six transactions listed below
involving target companies whose operations, for the purposes of Citi’s analysis and based on its experience and
professional judgment, Citi considered generally relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on
business sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics (such transactions collectively, the
“selected transactions”).
Citi calculated and reviewed, among other information, the implied firm value for the target company involved in each
transaction at the time of announcement (calculated based on (i) the aggregate consideration paid or to be paid in
such transaction, or, if and as applicable, (ii) the fully diluted equity value implied by the per share purchase price in
such transaction, plus net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests, and less unconsolidated investments
and non-operating assets, as applicable) as a multiple of the applicable target company’s publicly available EBITDA
(or metric functionally equivalent thereto) for the last twelve-month period (“LTM”) prior to the announcement of the
applicable transaction (such multiples, “Firm Value / LTM EBITDA”). The Firm Value / LTM EBITDA multiples
observed for the selected transactions were as follows:

Based on the multiples calculated and observed for the selected transactions and its professional judgment and
experience, Citi identified and applied a selected illustrative range of Firm Value / LTM EBITDA multiples of 12.6x to
15.9x to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020, to
derive a range of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne. Citi subtracted from the range of implied
adjusted firm values it derived Aerojet Rocketdyne’s reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2020 (calculated
as described above under the section entitled “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. - Selected
Public Companies Analysis”), and divided the results by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method and treating in-the-money
convertible debt as converted to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, based on information provided by
Aerojet Rocketdyne management. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value

Other Information
Citi observed certain other information with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne that was not considered part of its
financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but was noted for reference purposes only, including the following:
•
historical intraday trading prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for the 52-week period ended
December 18, 2020, which indicated an overall low to high intraday trading share price range of $32.15 to
$57.27 per share over the period; and
•
publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ one-year forward price targets, prepared and published in
relation to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, which indicated an overall low to high price target

TABLE OF CONTENTS
range of $43.00 to $55.00 per share, implying a range of approximately $39.50 to $50.50 per share on a
discounted basis (rounded to the nearest $0.25) when discounted one year at a discount rate of 8.7%,
reflecting a mid-point estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s cost of equity.
•
For the years 2010 through 2020 (as of December 18, 2020), Citi calculated, using publicly available
information, the median one-day unaffected stock price premia paid for acquisition transactions announced
during the period from 2010 through 2020 (as of December 18, 2020) involving 100% cash consideration
with a transaction value between $1 billion to $10 billion that Citi deemed appropriate in its professional
judgment, which indicated a median one-day unaffected stock price premium of 30%. Based on the
foregoing review and its professional judgment and experience, Citi applied a premia reference range of 20%
to 40% to (i) the closing share price of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020 of $42.04
and (ii) the cash-adjusted share price of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020 of $31.20
(calculated as price less $10.84 cash per share based on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s reported cash balance as of
September 30, 2020). This analysis indicated an illustrative range of prices per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $50.50 to $58.75, based on the closing share price of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020, and $48.25 to $54.50 (including $10.84 cash per
share) based on the cash-adjusted share price of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on December 18, 2020.
Miscellaneous
Aerojet Rocketdyne has agreed to pay Citi for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee of $15
million, $2 million of which became payable upon delivery of Citi’s opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors, and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon the consummation of the proposed Merger. In
addition, Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed to reimburse Citi for certain expenses incurred by Citi in performing its services,
and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws,
arising out of Citi’s engagement. Although Citi and its affiliates have not provided investment banking, commercial
banking or other similar financial services to Aerojet Rocketdyne during the two-year period prior to the date of Citi’s
opinion for which Citi and its affiliates received compensation, Citi and its affiliates in the future may provide such
services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and/or its affiliates, for which services Citi and its affiliates would expect to receive
compensation.
As Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors was aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are
providing and in the future may provide certain investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial
services to Lockheed Martin unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services Citi and such affiliates have
received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to the
date of Citi’s opinion, having acted as joint bookrunner for an offering of senior notes by Lockheed Martin in May
2020. For the services described above for Lockheed Martin and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during
the two-year period prior to the date of Citi’s opinion, aggregate fees of approximately $1.8 million.
In the ordinary course of Citi’s business, Citi and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of Aerojet
Rocketdyne or Lockheed Martin for Citi’s own account or for the account of Citi’s customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citi and its affiliates (including Citigroup Inc.
and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin and their respective
affiliates.
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors selected Citi as a financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on
Citi’s reputation, experience and familiarity with Aerojet Rocketdyne and its business. Citi is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions and other purposes.

Aerojet Rocketdyne retained Evercore to provide financial advisory services in connection with the Merger. As part
of this engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. On
December 19, 2020, at a meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the proposed Merger,
Evercore rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors its oral opinion, which was
64TABLE OF CONTENTS
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of December 19, 2020 and based upon and subject to the
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the merger consideration of
$56.00 per share minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend, to be received by
holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. Evercore’s written opinion noted that shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock owned by Lockheed
Martin or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, shares held by Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its
subsidiaries, and dissenting shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) would not be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated December 19, 2020, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated
herein by reference. Aerojet Rocketdyne encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Aerojet Rocketdyne board
of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not
constitute a recommendation to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the
Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock should vote or act in respect
of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business
or financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor does it address the underlying business
decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne that it
deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates and reviewed certain
additional business and financial information made available to Evercore by Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne prepared and furnished to
Evercore by management of Aerojet Rocketdyne, as approved for Evercore’s use by Aerojet Rocketdyne,
including the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast (collectively, the “Aerojet
Rocketdyne Forecasts”);
•
discussed with management of Aerojet Rocketdyne their assessment of the past and current operations of
Aerojet Rocketdyne, the current financial condition and prospects of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the Aerojet
Rocketdyne Forecasts, including their views on the alternative business scenarios underlying the Base
Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, respectively;
•
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock;
•
compared the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its stock market trading multiples with
those of certain other publicly traded companies that it deemed relevant;
•
compared the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the valuation multiples relating to the
Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that it deemed
relevant;
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 17, 2020, of the Merger Agreement;
and
•
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that it deemed
appropriate.
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
board of directors on December 19, 2020 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however,
does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses
described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by
Evercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market
data, is based on market data that existed on or before December 18, 2020 (the last full trading date prior to the
rendering of Evercore’s opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial
conditions, industry sector performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of
its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The estimates contained in Evercore’s
analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating
to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived
from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,
discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and Evercore has
not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and Evercore further
relied upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Base Case Forecast
and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, respectively, Evercore assumed with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s consent that they
were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of
management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne in the alternative
business scenarios underlying the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, respectively. Evercore
expressed no view as to the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast or the alternative business
scenarios or other assumptions on which they were based.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the final
executed agreement would not differ from the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by Evercore, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore
further assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals
or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or
condition that would have an adverse effect on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the consummation of the Merger or reduce
the contemplated benefits to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock of the Merger. The credit, financial
and stock markets had been experiencing unusual volatility and Evercore expressed no opinion or view as to any
potential effects of such volatility on the parties or the Merger. In addition, Evercore relied, without independent
verification, on the assessments of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to (i) the validity of, and risks
associated with, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s intellectual property, technology, products and services, and (ii) the
marketability, commercial viability and market adoption of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current and future products and
services.
Evercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Aerojet Rocketdyne and did not make
or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor was Evercore
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor has Evercore evaluated the solvency or fair value of Aerojet
Rocketdyne under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion
is necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date of its opinion and financial,
economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. It is
understood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore’s opinion and that Evercore does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and Evercore expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the proposed
transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of
any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Aerojet Rocketdyne, or any
class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did
Evercore express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or

aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or
any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or
amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor does
it address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger. In arriving at its opinion,
Evercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to the acquisition
of any or all of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock or any business combination or other extraordinary transaction
involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore was not expressing any
opinion as to the prices at which shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock will trade at any time, as to the
potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger or as to
the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Aerojet Rocketdyne or the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to
pay its obligations when they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed
the accuracy and completeness of assessments by Aerojet Rocketdyne and its advisors with respect to legal,
regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order
to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables
are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore’s financial analyses.
Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of such analyses.
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed discounted cash flow analyses of Aerojet Rocketdyne to calculate the estimated present value of
the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate during
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s fiscal years 2021 through 2029 based on each of the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted
Base Case Forecast. For purposes of this analysis, the projected cash flows provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management were adjusted with management’s approval to exclude the impact of cash pension contributions and
reimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows and real estate cash flows (collectively, the “additional
cash flow items”). The additional cash flow items were excluded from the projected cash flows on the basis that they
are significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of cash pension
contributions and reimbursements was reflected as a liability on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s balance sheet, and each of the
net environmental cash flows and real estate cash flows were reflected as assets. Evercore calculated terminal values
for Aerojet Rocketdyne by applying perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on
Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash
flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate based on the Aerojet Rocketdyne Forecasts. The cash
flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2020 using discount
rates ranging from 7.50% to 8.75%, which were based on an estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s weighted average cost
of capital and the mid-year cash flow discounting convention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values,
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt (excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted
cash and cash used to repurchase shares since September 30, 2020 per Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management) and net
environmental asset position resulting from government and other reimbursements that Aerojet Rocketdyne
management projects will more than fully offset Aerojet Rocketdyne’s payments related to its environmental
remediation liabilities as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s present value of forecast cash contributions to
fund pension liabilities, net of federal government reimbursement for certain pension expenses, for fiscal years 2021
through 2029, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s average estimated present value of real estate and the number of fully diluted
shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, this
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the
nearest $0.25 of $52.00 to $71.00 in the case of the Base Case Forecast and a range of implied equity values per share
of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $48.75 to $66.25 in the case of the Adjusted
Base Case Forecast, each as compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Public Company Trading Analysis
Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Aerojet Rocketdyne to corresponding financial
multiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the defense industry (the “selected
companies”) which Evercore deemed most relevant to consider in relation to Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on its
professional judgment and experience, because they are public companies with operations that, for purposes of its
analysis, Evercore considered similar to the operations of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
For each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated, based on closing share prices as of December 18, 2020 (i)
enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus total debt, plus after-tax unfunded pension and other
post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) obligations as of December 31, 2019, plus minority interest, less cash and cash
equivalents and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, all as of latest available publicly filed balance sheets unless
otherwise noted) as a multiple of estimated 2021 and 2022 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,” provided that when used
with respect to companies other than Aerojet Rocketdyne, no adjustments attributable to the Aerojet Rocketdyne
real estate segment and income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation liability are
included in such definition), which we refer to as “2021E Adjusted EBITDA” and “2022E Adjusted EBITDA,”
respectively, and (ii) closing share prices as a multiple of estimated 2021 and 2022 earnings per share (“EPS”), which
we refer to as “2021E EPS” and “2022E EPS,” respectively. Estimated financial data of the selected companies (pro
forma as applicable) were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates.

Base Case Forecast
Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,
Evercore selected a reference range of: enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x - 12.0x and applied this
range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Base Case
Forecast, enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.0x - 11.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Base Case Forecast; price/EPS multiples of
14.0x - 17.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2021 EPS (excluding
cash) based on the Base Case Forecast, and price/EPS multiples of 13.0x - 16.0x and applied this range of multiples to
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2022 EPS (excluding cash) based on the Base Case Forecast. “EPS
(excluding cash)” reflects Aerojet Rocketdyne’s forecast net income and average fully diluted share count, excluding
estimated post-tax income per average fully diluted share attributable to interest earned on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
balance of cash and marketable securities. Evercore made this adjustment to EPS in order to be able to more
accurately infer a range of valuation multiples for Aerojet Rocketdyne based on the trading valuations of its peers,
for which cash makes up a materially lower portion of total market capitalization. Based on these ranges of implied
enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt (excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities
(excluding restricted cash) and net environmental asset position as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities as of December 31, 2019, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s average estimated
present value of real estate and the number of fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case
as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share
of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $45.25 to $53.25, $41.75 to $50.00, $40.50 to

$47.00, and $43.75 to $51.25, respectively, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Adjusted Base Case Forecast
Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,
Evercore selected a reference range of: enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x - 12.0x and applied this
range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Adjusted Base
Case Forecast, enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.0x - 11.0x and applied this range of multiples to
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast;
price/EPS multiples of 14.0x - 17.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year
2021 EPS (excluding cash) based on the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, and price/EPS multiples of 13.0x - 16.0x and
applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2022 EPS (excluding cash) based on the
Adjusted Base Case Forecast. Based on these ranges of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt
(excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted cash) and net environmental asset
position as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities as of
December 31, 2019, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s average estimated present value of real estate and the number of fully
diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock
rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $44.00 to $51.75, $40.25 to $48.00, $39.50 to $45.75, and $42.25 to $49.50, respectively,
compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent
paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Although none of the selected companies are directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Evercore selected these
companies because they are publicly traded defense companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and
experience, considered generally relevant to Aerojet Rocketdyne for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating
the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and
market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected
companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding
many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the
selected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using the data of the selected companies.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected transactions
involving target companies in the defense and aerospace industries announced since 2015 (the “selected
transactions”). For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined as the target
company’s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus
minority interest and after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities (post-Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 effective date, if relevant), less cash and cash equivalents and net of acquired
tax benefits, if relevant) as a multiple of last twelve-month (LTM) Adjusted EBITDA for the target company at the
time of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which we refer to as “LTM Adjusted EBITDA.” Estimated
financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement
of the relevant transaction. Any transactions reported in non-USD values reflect the applicable foreign exchange rate
as of the date of announcement of the relevant transaction.

Based on the multiples it derived from the selected transactions and based on its professional judgment and
experience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value to LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 12.0x to
14.0x and applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2020
based on the financial results for Aerojet Rocketdyne provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management and to Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s estimated 2020 Adjusted EBITDA based on the Base Case Forecast. Based on this range of implied
enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt (excluding convertible notes), cash and marketable securities
(excluding restricted cash) and net environmental asset position as of September 30, 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities as of December 31, 2019, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s average estimated
present value of real estate and the number of fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, in each case
as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share
of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $46.25 to $53.00 and $48.00 to $55.25,
respectively, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock minus,
to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly
comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger,
Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional
judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to Aerojet Rocketdyne for purposes of its financial analyses.
In evaluating the selected transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business,
economic and market conditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters,
as well as differences in financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target
companies or businesses in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not

Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to
its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock during the twelve-
month period ended December 18, 2020, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged
from $32.42 to $55.96 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock, respectively.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock prepared and published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of December 18, 2020,
the last full trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors. These price targets reflect analysts’ estimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock at the time the price target was published. As of December 18, 2020, the
range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock was
$43.00 to $55.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily
reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock and these target prices
and the analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including
factors affecting the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and future general industry and market
conditions.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price
Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical
future value of a company’s equity as a function of that company’s EPS.
In calculating the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock,
Evercore first calculated a range of implied future prices per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on
December 31, 2023 by multiplying Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated calendar year 2024 EPS based on each of the
Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast by a range of illustrative price-to-earnings ratios of
20.6x to 22.6x. Evercore then discounted the implied share prices back to December 31, 2020 using discount rates
ranging from 8.25% to 9.25%, which were based on an estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s cost of equity. This
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to
the nearest $0.25 of $48.75 to $54.75 and $46.50 to $52.50 based on the Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted
Base Case Forecast, respectively, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 39 all-cash and 50 total transactions and announced
bids for control of U.S. public targets by strategic acquirors with an aggregate transaction value between $2
billion and $6 billion announced since January 1, 2015 (excluding financial, REIT, master limited partnership and
pharmaceutical targets, mergers of equals, acquisitions by financial sponsors and transactions between related
parties). Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which
the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market
prices per share of the target companies one day and four weeks prior to announcement of each transaction.

Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied (i) a
premium range of 20% to 45% to $31.26, representing the closing market price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock on December 18, 2020 minus the $10.78 amount of cash and marketable securities (excluding
restricted cash) per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s balance sheet as of
September 30, 2020, and (ii) a premium range of 25% to 45% to $31.26, representing the closing market price per

marketable securities (excluding restricted cash) per share on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s balance sheet as of
September 30, 2020. The resulting products were added to $10.78 of cash and marketable securities (excluding
restricted cash) per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. This analysis indicated a range of implied
equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $48.25 to $56.00
and $49.75 to $56.00 based on the one-day prior and four-weeks prior premia, respectively, compared to the
merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock minus, to the extent paid, the
amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors. In connection with the review
of the Merger by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
summary described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of
all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor
considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have
given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of
Evercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. Rounding may result in
total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the
prices at which the business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially
different from those forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The
issuance of Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors or
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration in the Merger for the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Aerojet Rocketdyne has agreed to
pay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $15 million, of which $1 million was paid upon
delivery of Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for certain expenses and to indemnify Evercore
against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to
provide financial advisory or other services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and Evercore has not received any compensation
from Aerojet Rocketdyne during such period. In addition, during the two-year period prior to the
72
TABLE OF CONTENTS
date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services
to Lockheed Martin and Evercore has not received any compensation from Lockheed Martin during such period.
Evercore may provide financial advisory or other services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin in the future,
and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of
customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,
placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise,
Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them
may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or
otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior
loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne or its affiliates,
Lockheed Martin or its affiliates or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
Aerojet Rocketdyne engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s qualifications, experience
and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness
opinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate
and other purposes.

Although Aerojet Rocketdyne may periodically issue limited guidance to investors concerning its expected financial
performance, Aerojet Rocketdyne does not as a matter of course publicly disclose long-term financial projections due
to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and
estimates, particularly in the aerospace and defense industry. However, in connection with the proposed Merger,
Aerojet Rocketdyne management prepared certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s future results of operations for fiscal years ending 2020 through 2029.
One set of financial projections (referred to herein as the “Base Case Forecast”) was based upon and reflected,
among other things, an assumption that the NASA Space Launch System (“SLS”) manifest would ramp up from
about one launch per year to two launches per year beginning in 2028. The Base Case Forecast was provided to and
its assumptions were discussed with Lockheed Martin, and was also provided to, and reviewed with, the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors as well as Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial advisors, Citi and Evercore, for use, with the
approval of Aerojet Rocketdyne, in connection with Citi’s and Evercore’s respective financial analyses and opinions
described above under the sections in this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global
Markets Inc.” and “The Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.,” respectively. Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed
Martin also discussed, among other things, the possibility that the NASA SLS manifest would remain at about one
launch per year (rather than ramping up to two launches per year beginning in 2028, as contemplated by the Base
Case Forecast).
Another set of more conservative financial projections (referred to herein as the “Adjusted Base Case Forecast”) was
based upon and reflected, among other things, the assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would remain at about
one launch per year. The Adjusted Base Case Forecast was provided to, and reviewed with, the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors as well as Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial advisors, Citi and Evercore, for use, with the approval of
Aerojet Rocketdyne, in connection with Citi’s and Evercore’s respective financial analyses and opinions described
above under the sections in this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Market Inc.”
and “The Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.,” respectively.
The Base Case Forecast and the Adjusted Base Case Forecast are referred to herein collectively as the “Aerojet
Rocketdyne Forecasts.”
Base Case Forecast. Aerojet Rocketdyne management prepared the Base Case Forecast as summarized below:
•
For years 2020 through 2024 in the Base Case Forecast, Aerojet Rocketdyne management used Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s then-current (as of September 2020) 5-year strategic growth plan, which was based upon and
reflected an assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would ramp up from about one launch per year to two
launches per year beginning in 2028. Years 2020 through 2024 in the Base Case Forecast reflected numerous
other Aerojet Rocketdyne management assumptions consistent with such 5-year
73TABLE OF CONTENTS
strategic growth plan, including, among other things, (1) generation of future revenues in Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s aerospace and defense business based in part on its existing firm and follow-on backlog and
assumptions of new business with, in Aerojet Rocketdyne management’s view, a reasonable probability of
winning, (2) aerospace and defense EBITDA margins ranging from 15.0% to 15.8%, (3) depreciation and
amortization ranging from 2% to 3% of revenue, (4) capital expenditures ranging from 2% to 3% of revenue,
and (5) an applicable tax rate of 26%.
•
For years 2025 through 2029 in the Base Case Forecast, Aerojet Rocketdyne management extrapolated, from
the last year of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s strategic growth plan, results for those next five years, with a
continuing assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would ramp up from about one launch per year to two
launches per year beginning in 2028. Years 2025 through 2029 in the Base Case Forecast also reflected
numerous other Aerojet Rocketdyne management assumptions, including, among other things, (1)
generation of future revenues in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s aerospace and defense business based in part on its
existing firm and follow-on backlog and assumptions of new business with, in Aerojet Rocketdyne
management’s view, a reasonable probability of winning, (2) aerospace and defense EBITDA margin growth
ranging from 16.0% to 16.5%, (3) depreciation and amortization equal to 3% of revenue, (4) capital
expenditures equal to 2% of revenue, and (5) an applicable tax rate of 26%.
Adjusted Base Case Forecast. Aerojet Rocketdyne management prepared the Adjusted Base Case Forecast using
similar assumptions as the Base Case Forecast, except that (1) the Adjusted Base Case Forecast was based upon and
reflected an assumption that the NASA SLS manifest would remain at about one launch per year (rather than ramping
up to two launches per year beginning in 2028) and (2) Aerojet Rocketdyne management decremented revenue and
associated profit and cash flow in amounts that, in its judgment, were appropriate to reflect such assumed reduced
NASA SLS launch manifest.
Risk Adjusted Case Analysis. In addition, in November 2020, Aerojet Rocketdyne management provided to the
Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, Citi and Evercore a downside risk-based sensitivity analysis in respect of the
Adjusted Base Case Forecast (the “Risk Adjusted Case Analysis”) taking into account Aerojet Rocketdyne
management’s evolving and expanding view that there was growing uncertainty in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s space
exploration business prospects. The Risk Adjusted Case Analysis was based on similar assumptions as the Adjusted
Base Case Forecast, except that (1) the Risk Adjusted Case Analysis further assumed that NASA’s schedule for
landing a human presence on the moon could potentially be delayed and that space exploration-related new business
might not be funded or won at the same rate assumed in the Adjusted Base Case Forecast and (2) Aerojet
Rocketdyne management further decremented revenue and associated profit and cash flow in amounts that, in its
judgment, were appropriate to reflect such assumed slippage in the moon landing schedule and reduced space
exploration-related new business.
Management Presentation Forecast. In May 2020 Aerojet Rocketdyne management had also provided to Lockheed
Martin and Citi (and in October 2020 Aerojet Rocketdyne management provided to Evercore) certain non-public,
unaudited financial projections regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2020 through
2029 (the “Management Presentation Forecast”), which projections were subsequently superseded by the Base Case
Forecast in September 2020. The Management Presentation Forecast had been based on substantially similar
assumptions as the Base Case Forecast, except that the Base Case Forecast in September 2020 incorporated emerging
opportunities that added approximately $500 million more revenue, and associated profit and cash flow, over the 10-
year period than the Management Presentation Forecast had assumed.
The Risk Adjusted Case Analysis and the Management Presentation Forecast were neither approved by Aerojet
Rocketdyne for use, nor used, by Citi or Evercore in connection with Citi’s and Evercore’s respective financial
analyses and opinions described above under the sections in this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion
of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” and “The Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.,” respectively.
We sometimes refer to the Base Case Forecast, the Adjusted Base Case Forecast, the Risk Adjusted Case Analysis
and the Management Presentation Forecast collectively as the “Management Projections.”
The below summary of the Management Projections is included in this proxy statement for the purpose of providing
stockholders certain nonpublic information that was furnished to certain persons and parties (in each case, as and to
the extent described in this section of the proxy statement captioned

TABLE OF CONTENTS
“The Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”) in connection with evaluating the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such information may not be appropriate for
other purposes, and it is not included to influence the voting decision of any stockholder on the Merger Proposal or
any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any
investment decision with respect to the Merger. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward
public disclosure, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections, the use of non-GAAP financial
measures or forward-looking statements, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for the preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. None of Aerojet Rocketdyne,
Lockheed Martin, Citi, Evercore or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives
considered, or now consider, the inclusion of the Management Projections to be regarded as an indication that the
Management Projections are predictive of actual future events, actual future results or performance of Aerojet
Rocketdyne, or actual future results or performance of Lockheed Martin following its acquisition of Aerojet
Rocketdyne, and such information should not be relied upon as such. Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned
not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.
While presented here with numeric specificity, the Management Projections were based on many variables and
assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance and general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and additional matters specific to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business) that are inherently subjective
and uncertain, continually evolving and beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management. Important factors
that may affect actual results and cause this unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved include,
but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business (including its ability to
achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and
economic conditions, changes in laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, tax laws and regulations),
changes in government priorities and other factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 16. The Management Projections also reflect numerous variables,
expectations and assumptions available at the time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Management
Projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized.
Stockholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of Aerojet Rocketdyne for a description of the reported
results of operations and financial condition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, including in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2019, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.
None of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin, Citi, Evercore or their respective officers, directors, affiliates,
advisors or other representatives can provide you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from this
unaudited prospective financial information.
NEITHER AEROJET ROCKETDYNE, LOCKHEED MARTIN, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY UNDERTAKES ANY
OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS
TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE THE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS WERE
GENERATED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR
ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR. SINCE
THE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS COVER MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS NATURE
BECOMES MORE LIKELY TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE
YEAR.
Aerojet Rocketdyne has not made and makes no representation to Lockheed Martin or any Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholder or other stakeholder or any other party, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the
Management Projections or regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s actual performance compared to the Management
Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. The inclusion of this unaudited prospective financial
information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Aerojet Rocketdyne that
the information is material. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in this unaudited
prospective financial information, Aerojet Rocketdyne urges all of its stockholders not to place undue reliance, if any,
on such information and to review Aerojet Rocketdyne’s most recent SEC filings for a description of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s reported financial results and condition.

and officers’ liability insurance policy or policies and (ii) fiduciary liability insurance policy or policies, in each case,
subject to a cap on aggregate premiums equal to 300% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date of the

Merger Agreement with respect to acts, omissions or events occurring prior to the Merger.
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
The Merger Agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to the awards held by our directors
and executive officers at the effective time of the Merger.
Restricted Stock
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each share of
restricted common stock held by our directors and executive officers on which restrictions have not yet lapsed and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (i) shall automatically become fully vested
(and for shares of restricted common stock subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of
maximum performance) and all restrictions applicable thereto shall lapse and (ii) shall terminate and be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the sum of (1) the Price Per Share, plus (2) to the extent paid or
payable to holders of common stock and payable but unpaid on such share of restricted common stock, the amount
per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (including, without duplication, any accrued and unpaid dividends payable
with respect to the restricted shares), less (B) any applicable withholding or other taxes or other amounts required by
applicable law to be withheld.
In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will accrue dividends payable with
respect to shares of restricted common stock issued and outstanding as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, in
an amount equal to the per-share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
As of January 20, 2021, the Company’s executive officers held an aggregate of 656,013 shares of common stock
subject to unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (all of which restricted stock units are Pre-
Signing RSUs (as defined below)), and the Company’s non-employee directors held an aggregate of 14,016 shares of
common stock subject to unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (all of which restricted stock
units are Pre-Signing RSUs).
Options
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each option to purchase common stock held
by our executive officers that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to
receive (subject to any applicable withholding or other taxes, or other amounts required by applicable law to be
withheld), upon delivery of an option notice and acknowledgment in the form attached as an exhibit to the Merger
Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such
option, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) the Price Per Share over (B) the per share exercise price (determined
after downward adjustments to such exercise price contemplated in connection with the Pre-Closing Dividend) for the
common stock subject to such option. If the exercise price applicable to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock
subject to an option is equal to or greater than the Price Per Share, the option shall terminate and be canceled for no
consideration.
80
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will reduce the exercise price with
respect to options to purchase common stock issued and outstanding as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, in
an amount equal to the per-share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
SARs
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each stock appreciation right, or “SAR,” held
by our directors and executive officers that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof
will be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable withholding or other taxes, or other amounts required by
applicable law to be withheld), upon delivery of a stock appreciation rights notice and acknowledgment in the form
attached as an exhibit to the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of common stock subject to such SAR multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) the Price Per Share over (B)
the per share grant price (determined after downward adjustments to such grant price contemplated in connection
with the Pre-Closing Dividend) for the common stock subject to such SAR. If the grant price applicable to shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock subject to a SAR is equal to or greater than the Price Per Share, the SAR shall
terminate and be canceled for no consideration.
In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will reduce the grant price with
respect to SARs issued and outstanding as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, in an amount equal to the per-
share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
As of January 20, 2021, the Company’s executive officers held an aggregate of 87,485 stock appreciation rights, and
the Company’s non-employee directors did not hold any stock appreciation rights.
RSUs
Pre-Signing RSUs. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each unvested restricted
stock unit, or “RSU,” held by our executive officers and granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, or a “Pre-
Signing RSU” that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger shall automatically become
fully vested (and for such Pre-Signing RSUs subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement
of maximum performance). Each vested Pre-Signing RSU, including those that become vested in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence and in each case, with respect to which shares of common stock have not yet been
issued, shall be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to any
applicable withholding or other taxes, or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the sum of (A) the Price Per Share, plus (B) to the extent paid or payable to holders of
common stock and payable but unpaid on such Pre-Signing RSU, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend
(including, without duplication, the amount of any dividend equivalent accrued on such Pre-Signing RSU, if any),
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such vested Pre-Signing RSU.
Post-Signing RSUs. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each unvested RSU
granted on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, or a “Post-Signing RSU,” held by our executive officers that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger shall be automatically canceled and extinguished
and shall receive the following treatment:
•
For each former holder of a Post-Signing RSU who remains employed with Lockheed Martin or its affiliates
as of the grant date of the Lockheed Martin RSUs contemplated by this paragraph (which grant date shall
in all events be within 30 days of the closing date of the Merger), Lockheed Martin shall grant an award of
Lockheed Martin restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Lockheed Martin common
stock with a value equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such
canceled and forfeited Post-Signing RSUs (and for such Post-Signing RSUs subject to performance vesting
criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance), multiplied by (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and rounded up to the nearest whole number (such replacement awards,
the “Lockheed Martin RSUs”), where such Lockheed Martin RSUs shall be eligible to vest (1) to the extent
such Lockheed Martin RSU replaces a Post-Signing RSU subject solely to time-based vesting, on the same
vesting schedule applicable to such canceled and extinguished Post-Signing RSU, based on continued
service following the effective time of the Merger through each applicable vesting date, (2) to the extent
such Lockheed Martin RSU
81
TABLE OF CONTENTS
replaces a Post-Signing RSU subject to performance-based vesting, in full as of the end of the performance
period applicable to such canceled and extinguished Post-Signing RSU, based on continued service
following the effective time of the Merger through such vesting date, and (3) in full upon an earlier
termination of employment or service by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates without cause or an earlier
resignation for good reason (as defined by the parties).
•
For each former holder of a Post-Signing RSU who is employed by Aerojet Rocketdyne as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger and who does not remain employed with Lockheed Martin or its
affiliates as of the grant date of the Lockheed Martin RSUs, such former holder shall be entitled to receive
(subject to any applicable withholding or other taxes, or other amounts required by applicable law to be
withheld) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the sum of (1) the Price Per Share, plus (2) to the
extent paid to holders of common stock and payable but unpaid on such Post-Signing RSU, the amount per
share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (including, without duplication, the amount of any dividend equivalent
accrued on such Post-Signing RSU, if any), multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of common stock
subject to such canceled and forfeited Post-Signing RSU (and for such Post-Signing RSUs subject to
performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance), which amount shall
be made by the Surviving Corporation within ten business days after the termination of such former
holder’s employment.
The “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means, with respect to each Post-Signing RSU, the quotient determined by
dividing (a) the sum of (i) the Price Per Share, plus (ii) to the extent paid to holders of common stock and payable but
unpaid on such Post-Signing RSU, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (including, without duplication,
the amount of any dividend equivalent accrued on such Post-Signing RSU) by (b) the volume weighted average of
the closing sale prices per share of Lockheed Martin common stock on the NYSE, as reported in the New York City
edition of The Wall Street Journal (or, if not reported thereby, as reported in another authoritative source), on each of
the five full consecutive trading days ending on and including the third (3rd) business day prior to the closing date
of the Merger.
In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will accrue dividend equivalents
payable with respect to RSUs issued and outstanding as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, in an amount
equal to the per-share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
Quantification of Payments
For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of our named executive officers in respect of their
unvested equity awards, see the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” below. The estimated aggregate amount that
would be payable to our directors and 6 executive officers who are not named executive officers in respect of their
197,811 currently outstanding and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards upon the effective time
of the Merger is $11,077,416; the estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to our directors and executive
officers who are not named executive officers in respect of their currently outstanding stock options upon the
effective time of the Merger is $0; the estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to our directors and
executive officers who are not named executive officers in respect of their currently outstanding SARs upon the
effective time of the Merger is $903,588 (each taking into account dividend / dividend equivalent payments and
adjustments and, in the case of Post-Signing RSUs, assuming that the executive officer will not remain employed by
Lockheed Martin following the effective time of the Merger).
Golden Parachute Payment Mitigation
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on December 19, 2020, the Organization & Compensation
Committee of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors approved the following actions, effective December 22, 2020,
to, in part, mitigate the impact of adverse tax consequences to the Company and to certain of our executive officers
pursuant to the golden parachute provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code: (1) accelerated payment of
annual cash incentive awards under our 2020 Short-Term Incentive Program at the 150% payout level for each of our
executive officers (other than Mr. Lichtenstein), with any remaining amount earned to be certified by the committee
and paid in 2021; (2) accelerated vesting of performance-based restricted stock grants awarded under our 2018 Long-
Term Incentive Program at the 150% payout level for each of our executive officers (other than Mr. Lichtenstein), with
any remaining amount earned under such awards to be
82
TABLE OF CONTENTS
certified by the committee and vested in 2021; (3) accelerated vesting of time-based equity awards held by each of
our executive officers (other than Mr. Lichtenstein) that were otherwise scheduled to vest based on continued
employment in 2021; (4) accelerated vesting of time-based equity awards that were otherwise scheduled to vest
based on continued employment in 2022 held by each of Ms. Drake, Mr. Boehle and, by separate action on December
22, 2020, two other executive officers who are not named executive officers; (5) accelerated vesting of time-based
stock options and stock appreciation rights held by Mr. Lichtenstein that were otherwise scheduled to vest based on
continued employment in 2022; (6) the grant to Ms. Drake, Mr. Boehle and one other executive officer who is not a
named executive officer of the restricted stock awards that would otherwise have been granted to those executive
officers in 2021 with vesting criteria consistent with prior performance-based equity awards; and (7) the payment to
Mr. Lichtenstein of a cash award in the amount of $3,900,000 in lieu of any long-term incentive award in 2021, a
portion of which cash award is subject to recoupment by us in the event Mr. Lichtenstein’s employment terminates
prior to December 22, 2023 due to his resignation or our termination of his employment for cause prior to the closing
of the Merger.
The estimated aggregate amount realized by our executive officers who are not named executive officers pursuant to
the accelerated vesting described in clauses (3), (4) and (5) of the preceding paragraph (based upon our closing stock
price on December 22, 2020, the date of vesting acceleration) was $3,067,279.
Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control
We are party to an employment agreement with Ms. Drake, which was amended and restated on March 4, 2020 (the
“Drake Employment Agreement”). Under the Drake Employment Agreement, if Ms. Drake’s employment is terminated
by us without “cause” (including due to a death or disability) or by Ms. Drake for “good reason” within the period
commencing six months prior to (or, if earlier, following the signing of a definitive agreement that, if consummated,
would result in a change in control) and ending 24 months following a “change in control,” then Ms. Drake shall be
entitled to the following payments and benefits: (i) accrued obligations; (ii) annual target bonus for the pro-rated
portion of the fiscal year prior to the change in control, paid in a lump sum; (iii) a severance payment equal to three
times the sum of (y) Ms. Drake’s base salary and (z) annual target bonus, paid in a lump sum; (iv) to the extent
unvested at the time of Ms. Drake’s termination of employment, immediate full vesting of all of Ms. Drake’s equity
awards (at the maximum level of performance, if applicable); (v) the opportunity to continue to participate in our life
insurance policy in which she is enrolled before the date of termination at an amount of one times base salary for a
period of 12 months following the date of termination; (vi) provided Ms. Drake timely elects and is eligible for COBRA
coverage, payment by us of the premiums associated with 24 months of Ms. Drake’s continued participation, without
any required contributions from Ms. Drake (but subject to all other plan terms, including co-payments and
deductibles) in the health benefit plans in which Ms. Drake is enrolled prior to the date of termination; (vii) the
opportunity to continue to participate in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program for a period of 24
months following termination and (viii) outplacement services provided by the company-designated outplacement
firm for a period of 18 months starting no later than ninety (90) days from Ms. Drake’s date of termination, with a
maximum value of $25,000 (in each case, as such terms are defined in the Drake Employment Agreement). Receipt of
such compensation and benefits is contingent on Ms. Drake’s timely execution of a release in the form attached to
the Drake Employment Agreement.
We also maintain an executive change in control severance policy, which was amended on March 5, 2020 (the “CIC
Policy”). The CIC Policy provides all of our executive officers, other than Ms. Drake and Mr. Lichtenstein, with
compensation and benefits upon a termination of their employment by us without “cause” or by the executive for
“good reason” (including due to an executive’s death or “disability”) within the six-month period prior to a “change
in control” (or, if earlier, following the signing of a definitive agreement that, if consummated, would result in a change
in control) through the 24-month period following a “change in control” (in each case, as such terms are defined in
the CIC policy). In the event of an applicable termination of employment, the executive officer shall be entitled to the
following:
•
lump sum payment equal to two times the executive officer’s annual base salary;
•
prorated portion of incentive compensation under our short-term incentive plan (“STIP”) for the
performance year in which the “termination date” (as defined in the CIC Policy) occurs (prorated based on
length of employment during such performance year), at the greater of target and actual performance;
83
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
full STIP payment for the year prior to the termination date, if unpaid as of the termination date, based upon
actual performance;
•
lump sum payment equal to two times the target incentive compensation such executive officer could have
received under the STIP for the entire year in which the termination date occurs;
•
continued participation in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program for a period of 24 months
following termination;
•
payment of COBRA benefit premiums until the earlier of the 24-month anniversary of the termination date or
when eligible for health insurance coverage through another employer;
•
to the extent unvested, immediate full vesting of all of the executive officer’s equity awards (at the maximum
level of performance, if applicable); and
•
outplacement services for a period of 12 months starting no later than 90 days from date of termination,
with a maximum value of $15,000.
Receipt of compensation and benefits under the CIC Policy is contingent on the executive officer’s timely execution
of a release in a form we prescribe.
The Merger will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of each of these arrangements. These arrangements do
not include a “gross-up” of any golden parachute excise tax imposed on the executive officer pursuant to Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, payments would be reduced to an amount equal to the greatest dollar
amount that would not subject the executive officer to the imposition of the excise tax, unless the executive officer
would be placed in a better after-tax position receiving all payments and paying the excise tax.
The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to our executive officers who are not named executive
officers under the CIC Policy upon the effective time of the Merger is $11,209,986.
Payments under Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors
Certain of our non-employee directors and Mr. Lichtenstein participate in the Company’s Deferred Compensation
Plan for Directors. In connection with the Merger, accrued account balances under such plan will become immediately
payable in a cash lump sum.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this
compensation.
The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for
purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on January 15, 2021, and that the employment of each of the
named executive officers were subject to an involuntary termination without cause on January 15, 2021. The amounts
indicated in the table below also assume that the amount payable in respect of outstanding and unvested equity
awards will be $56.00 per share. Our executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation,
tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger.
84
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In
addition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment,
these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table
below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger
may differ from the amounts set forth below.

Mark A. Tucker, our former Chief Operating Officer, and Paul R. Lundstrom, our former Vice President, Chief Financial Officer,
are not eligible to receive any benefits in connection with the Merger and thus have not been included in the table above.
(2)
For Mr. Lichtenstein, this amount reflects the cash award paid on December 22, 2020 in lieu of any long-term incentive award in
2021 (which was a single trigger payment). For the other named executive officers, the amounts reflect estimated double-trigger
payments of the lump-sum cash severance that would be provided to the named executive officer under the terms of the Drake
Employment Agreement or the CIC Policy, as applicable, if the named executive officer were to experience a covered
termination for the purposes of the Drake Employment Agreement or the CIC Policy, as applicable, on the closing date of the
merger, as described above in “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -
Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control,” calculated as (i) a pro-rated annual bonus for 2021, assuming target
performance and (ii) three times, in the case of Ms. Drake, or two times, in the case of Mr. Boehle and Mr. Schumacher, base
salary plus target short-term incentive compensation. The amounts assume that the annual bonus for 2020 was earned and paid
prior to the closing date of the merger and thus are not reflected in the table. For each of Ms. Drake and Messrs. Boehle and
Schumacher, the pro-rata bonus component is $38,095, $14,640, and $11,204, respectively, and the cash severance component
is $5,562,000, $1,662,500 and $1,384,126, respectively.
(3)
The amounts reflect the aggregate payment that each named executive officer would receive with respect to equity awards
outstanding and unvested as of January 15, 2021 and subject to single trigger vesting acceleration in connection with the merger,
as described above in “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.” In addition, the amounts reflect the aggregate value, based on our closing stock price on
December 22, 2020, of the equity awards that vested (single trigger) on December 22, 2020 for each of the named executive
officers as described above in “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -
Golden Parachute Payment Mitigation.” The amounts include the following for each named executive officer: For Mr.
Lichtenstein, $5,242,987 for options that vested on December 22, 2020, $3,750,000 for SARs that will vest upon
consummation of the Merger and $6,799,576 for restricted stock and RSU awards that will vest upon consummation of the
Merger. For Ms. Drake, $691,699 for SARs that vested on December 22, 2020, $1,162,238 for restricted stock and RSUs that
vested on December 22, 2020, and $16,063,320 for restricted stock and RSU awards that will vest upon consummation of the
Merger. For Mr. Boehle, $64,765 for SARs that vested on December 22, 2020, $221,467 for restricted stock and RSUs that
vested on December 22, 2020, and $1,642,816 for restricted stock and RSU awards that will vest upon consummation of the
Merger. For Mr. Schumacher, $156,316 for SARs that vested on December 22, 2020, $85,383 for restricted stock and RSUs that

the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program and the company-provided life insurance policy, as described above in “The
Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Payments Upon Termination
Following Change-in-Control.” For each of Ms. Drake and Messrs. Boehle and Schumacher, the COBRA premium component is
$18,133.20, $35,166, and $2,471, respectively, and the outplacement benefits component is $25,000, $15,000 and $15,000,

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who have complied exactly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL, including stockholders who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the effective
time of the Merger; and (iii) properly demand appraisal of their shares of common stock in compliance with the
requirements of Section 262 are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Section 262 and
is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of
record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder’s
name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person,
such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized
below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of common stock through a
bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker
or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) continuously hold their shares of common stock through
the effective time of the Merger; and (iii) otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262, will be
entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair
value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the
effective time of the Merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to exercise
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement constitutes Aerojet Rocketdyne’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection
with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with
the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve
such holder’s right to do so should review Annex D carefully.
Failure to comply exactly with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss
of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described
in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek
appraisal of shares of common stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such
rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must, among other
requirements, do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written demand for appraisal that complies with
Section 262 before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; and
86TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of common stock through the effective time of the
Merger.
The stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must also file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares of common stock within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger.
The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger
Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, abstain or not vote its shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne,
before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at the Special
Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be
submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder
must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date
the written demand for appraisal is made, and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of
the Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and it will constitute a waiver of
the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore,
a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing
instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Neither
voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby nor abstaining from
voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to
the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the
Special Meeting will result in a loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in
such holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on
behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Aerojet Rocketdyne of the identity of the holder and state
that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares of common stock in connection with the
Merger. If the shares of common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record
by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may
execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or
owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or
owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK
ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD
CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW
PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be delivered to:
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.
Attn: Corporate Secretary
222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500
El Segundo, California 90245
Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the
consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written withdrawal of
the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the
effective time of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just; provided, however, that such dismissal will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective time of the
Merger.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will
notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262
and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof, and include with such notice a copy of Section
262.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of common
stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving
Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares
held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present
intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate
any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of
common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal
rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed by Section 262. The
failure of a holder of shares of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 will
nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with
the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving
Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby with respect to which Aerojet Rocketdyne has
received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation
must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a
statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing
statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon
the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file
with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders
who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not
been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of
88
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied
with Section 262 and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require stockholders demanding appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails
to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
The Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the appraisal proceeding unless (i) the total number of shares entitled
to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the
“fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the
Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between
the effective time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the fair value is determined, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency
of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, to the former Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders
entitled to receive the same (in the case of shares represented by certificates, payment will not be made until such
certificates are surrendered to the surviving corporation). At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each former stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash,
in which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking
firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,
and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that the
Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could
result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Aerojet
Rocketdyne nor Lockheed Martin anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and each of Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin reserves the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the
Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs
of the appraisal proceedings (which do not
89
TABLE OF CONTENTS
include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and imposed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees
and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,
or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares of common stock will
be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no
petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to
vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the
stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of common stock, if any, payable to
stockholders as of a time prior to the effective time of the Merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the
stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger or thereafter with the written
approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition
for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as
to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval
of the court.
Failure to comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to
consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",91,95

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger and Pre-
Closing Dividend that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our
common stock. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”),
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue
Service, (“IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which
are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to
holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment purposes).
90TABLE OF CONTENTS
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as banks and other financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; retirement
plans or other tax-deferred accounts; S-corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as
partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and partners or investors
therein); insurance companies; mutual funds; brokers or dealers in stocks and securities; traders in
securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated
investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding the shares of common stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale or
conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
•
tax consequences to holders that received their shares of common stock on exercise of notes, warrants or
options or in a compensatory transaction;
•
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders that hold their shares of common stock through a bank, financial institution or
other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders that are, or that hold their shares of common stock through a passive foreign
investment company or controlled foreign corporation;
•
tax consequences to holders that hold their shares as “qualified small business stock” within the meaning
of Section 1202 of the Code or Section 1244 Stock for purposes of the Code;
•
U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
•
tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; or
•
any state, local or foreign tax consequences.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the
consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend.
No ruling from the IRS and no opinion of counsel has been or will be obtained regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger or Pre-Closing Dividend described below, and no assurance can be given that a holder
would ultimately prevail if the IRS were to challenge one or more of the tax consequences described in this summary.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX
LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION AND ANY APPLICABLE
INCOME TAX TREATY.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
91
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a trust: (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Subject to the discussion below concerning any Pre-Closing Dividend, a U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our shares generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares.
Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.
Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced
tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of an individual or other non-corporate U.S.
Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. Gain or loss realized generally must be calculated
separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered
pursuant to the Merger.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the per-share amount of cash payable as Merger consideration is subject
to reduction by the per-share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend. The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on the
Dividend Payment Date to stockholders of record on the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, and payment of the Pre-
Closing Dividend is not contingent upon approval or closing of the Merger. See the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Pre-Closing Cash Dividend.” Although the tax treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not
entirely clear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin intend to report the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution
with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that this
characterization applies, the amount of this distribution would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of
the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S.
Holder’s basis in its Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock (which will correspondingly reduce such basis), and finally
as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. Aerojet Rocketdyne cannot predict
whether it will have current or accumulated earnings and profits for its current taxable year (which will end in
connection with the Merger). The determination of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s earnings and profits entails complex factual
and legal analysis which cannot be completed until after the closing of the Merger. Once the determination is made,
Lockheed Martin will post this determination regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s earnings and profits for U.S. federal
income tax purposes on its website or otherwise inform former Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders of such
determination.
Assuming the Pre-Closing Dividend will be treated as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, individual Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders generally should be taxed on
the Pre-Closing Dividend at rates applicable to long-term capital gains so long as certain holding period and other
requirements are met. Corporate Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction
with respect to distributions treated as dividends if the Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholder is an otherwise qualifying
corporate holder that meets the holding period and certain other requirements. A dividend may be considered an
“extraordinary dividend” under U.S. federal income tax rules depending on the facts and circumstances of the Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholder. Treatment of a dividend as an extraordinary dividend may affect a corporate Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholder’s basis in its shares of common stock, or, with respect to individual stockholders, may affect
the tax characterization of a sale of his or her shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock. Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the “extraordinary dividend”
provisions of the Code in light of their particular circumstances.
It is possible that the IRS could disagree with the characterization of the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with
respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, instead, seek to characterize
the Pre-Closing Dividend as additional cash received in connection with the Merger. If this characterization were to
be sustained, the Pre-Closing Dividend would instead be treated as additional Merger consideration, with a
corresponding adjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder in the Merger.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing
Dividend in light of their particular circumstances.
92
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock
that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed
base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such Non-U.S. Holder
is a foreign corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax equal to 30% of its
effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger, and certain other
specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and may be offset by certain U.S. source capital
losses recognized in the same taxable year; or
•
Aerojet Rocketdyne is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is
defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (“USRPHC”) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period
ending on the date of the Merger and such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable
shares of common stock, which we refer to as the “Relevant Period,” and such Non-U.S. Holder owned
(actually or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the Relevant Period. We
believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the
Merger.
As discussed above under “- U.S. Holders,” although the tax treatment of the Pre-Closing Dividend is not entirely
clear, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin intend to report the Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with
respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that this
characterization applies, the amount of this distribution would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of
the Non-U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and subject to withholding (as discussed below), then as a return of
capital to the extent of the Non-U.S. Holder’s basis in its Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock (which will
correspondingly reduce such basis), and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Aerojet Rocketdyne
common stock.
Assuming the Pre-Closing Dividend will be treated as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common
stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
withholding at a rate of 30% with respect to the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend treated as a taxable dividend if
such dividend income is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United
States. The 30% rate may be reduced under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty between the United
States and the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is organized.
Income of Non-U.S. Holders that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and attributable to a U.S.
permanent establishment or fixed base in the case of Non-U.S. Holders subject to an applicable income tax treaty) will
be exempt from the U.S. federal income tax withholding described above and instead will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net basis at the regular graduated rates and in the manner applicable to a U.S. Holder (unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise). In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may be subject
to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted
for certain items, unless a lower rate applies under an applicable income tax treaty. As discussed above under “- U.S.
Holders,” Aerojet Rocketdyne cannot predict whether it will have current or accumulated earnings and profits for its
current taxable year (which will end in connection with the Merger). Once the determination is made, Lockheed
Martin will post this determination regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax
purposes on its website or otherwise inform former Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders of such determination.
93
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Since the determination of the portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend that is treated as a taxable dividend will not be
completed until after the closing of the Merger, it is possible that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Holder may withhold at a rate of 30% (or a
lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend. Non-U.S. Holders
generally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with
the IRS.
As discussed above under “- U.S. Holders,” it is possible that the IRS could disagree with the characterization of the
Pre-Closing Dividend as a distribution with respect to Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and, instead, seek to characterize the Pre-Closing Dividend as additional cash received in connection with
the Merger. If this characterization were to be sustained, the Pre-Closing Dividend would instead be treated as
additional Merger consideration received by a Non-U.S. Holder.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger and Pre-Closing
Dividend in light of their particular circumstances.
FATCA
Provisions of the Code commonly referred to as “FATCA” require withholding of 30% on payments of dividends on
Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock (including potentially the Pre-Closing Dividend) to “foreign financial institutions”
(which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other Non-U.S.
entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by
U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally
may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant
administrative burden). You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effects of FATCA on your receipt of the
Pre-Closing Dividend.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at the statutory rate) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder
pursuant to the Merger and Pre-Closing Dividend. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder
that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup
withholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that
(A) provides a certification of such holder’s foreign status on a properly completed appropriate series of IRS Form
W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (B) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a
refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne have generally agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary actions or approvals from governmental entities required to be obtained in connection with the execution
of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. These approvals include (i) that the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, has expired or
been terminated; and (ii) that any approvals or consents have been obtained, and any applicable waiting periods
have expired, with respect to any non-US jurisdiction in which a premerger notification is required.
Under the Merger Agreement, each of Aerojet Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin has agreed to use reasonable best
efforts, subject to specified limitations, to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals required to be
obtained (including under the HSR Act) from any governmental authorities or third parties in connection with the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. See “The Merger Agreement -
Efforts to Consummate the Merger” for more information.
94TABLE OF CONTENTS
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Lockheed Martin
and Aerojet Rocketdyne each file a Notification and Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has
expired or been terminated. In this matter, the FTC, and not the DOJ, has taken jurisdiction for the antitrust review. A
transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of waiting period following the
parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a 30-day period) or the early termination of that
waiting period. Under the HSR rules, the acquiring person (here, Lockheed Martin), may withdraw its filing and refile
it promptly thereafter to extend the initial HSR Act review period for another 30-day period. Before the expiration of
the initial waiting period, the FTC may issue a request for additional information to each of Lockheed Martin and
Aerojet Rocketdyne under the HSR Act (a “Second Request”). A Second Request is a burdensome request for
documents and information. Under the HSR Act, the waiting period during which the transaction cannot be
completed is extended until 30 days after each party substantially complies with the Second Request. In addition, in
order to provide for an orderly review process, parties frequently will enter into an agreement with the antitrust
agency that they will not complete the transaction until a date that is later than 30 days after substantial compliance
with the Second Request. Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne made the necessary filings with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ on January 19, 2021. The parties have concluded that no foreign premerger
notifications are required.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable
statutes, including seeking a court order to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of assets of the
parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual
rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such
action could include seeking a court order to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
certain circumstances.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when
it grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or
litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude
obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the
required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial
period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These
conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied, and could result in termination
of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms.

Exchange Act by, among other things, omitting certain allegedly material information with respect to the Merger in
the preliminary proxy statement filed by Aerojet Rocketdyne on January 25, 2021. The Myers Action and the Feinhals
Action also allege that the members of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with the Merger, and the Myers Action further alleges that Aerojet Rocketdyne aided and abetted the
directors’ alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs in the Actions seek, among other things, injunctive
relief, money damages and the costs of the Actions, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees.
Aerojet Rocketdyne and the members of its board of directors disagree with and intend to vigorously defend against
the Actions. If the Actions are not resolved on a timely basis, the Actions could delay consummation of the Merger
and result in additional costs to Aerojet Rocketdyne, including costs associated with the indemnification of directors.
Additional plaintiffs may file lawsuits against Aerojet Rocketdyne and/or our directors and officers in connection
with the Merger.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, Mizar
Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), will be merged with and into Aerojet Rocketdyne, with Aerojet Rocketdyne continuing as
the “Surviving Corporation” in the Merger. As a result of the Merger, Aerojet Rocketdyne will cease to be an
independent, publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. The Merger
will be effective at the time a certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later time as may be specified in such certificate of Merger with the consent of Aerojet Rocketdyne and
Lockheed Martin.
Merger Consideration
The Merger Agreement provides that upon completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, $0.10 par value per share, of Aerojet Rocketdyne (our “common stock”) will automatically be canceled and will
cease to exist and will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) $56.00 minus (B) to the
extent paid (or, in the event that the closing date occurs after the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date but before the
Dividend Payment Date, to the extent payable after the closing date), the $5.00 per share amount of the Pre-Closing
Dividend, without interest, other than the following: (i) any shares of common stock held by (A) Aerojet Rocketdyne
or any wholly owned subsidiary of Aerojet Rocketdyne (or held in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s treasury), including shares
of common stock reserved for issuance under any of our equity and performance incentive plans or the ESPP, but not
including any shares of common stock held by any of our employee plans or trusts related thereto, or (B) Lockheed
Martin, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned

subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (collectively, the “Cancelled
Shares”), which will be automatically canceled without payment of any consideration therefor and will cease to exist;
and (ii) shares of common stock, other than the Cancelled Shares, that are held by a stockholder of record who did
not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal with respect to such shares and is entitled to demand and validly demands
appraisal of such shares of common stock pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL.
The “Pre-Closing Dividend” referenced in the Merger Agreement is that certain cash dividend in an amount equal to
$5.00 per share of common stock declared by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, which dividend is payable
on March 24, 2021, or the “Dividend Payment Date,” to each stockholder of record of common stock as of the close

the event that the Merger closing date occurs after the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date but before the Dividend
Payment Date, which we do not expect to be the case, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, and Lockheed Martin will

Restricted Stock
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each share of
restricted common stock on which restrictions have not yet lapsed and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger (i) shall automatically become fully vested (and for shares of restricted common stock
subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance) and all restrictions
applicable thereto shall lapse and (ii) shall terminate and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to (A) the sum of (1) the Price Per Share, plus (2) to the extent paid or payable to holders of common stock and

Options
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each option to purchase common stock that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, whether vested or
unvested, will be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive (subject to any
applicable withholding or other taxes, or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld), upon delivery of
an option notice and acknowledgment in the form attached as an exhibit to the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such option multiplied by (ii) the
excess (if any) of (A) the Price Per Share over (B) the per share exercise price (determined after downward
adjustments to such exercise price contemplated in connection with the Pre-Closing Dividend) for the common stock
subject to such option. If the exercise price applicable to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock subject to an

equal to or greater than the Price Per Share, the SAR shall terminate and be canceled for no consideration.
In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will reduce the grant price with
respect to SARs issued and outstanding as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, in an amount equal to the per-
share amount of the Pre-Closing Dividend.
RSUs
Pre-Signing RSUs. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each unvested restricted
stock unit, or “RSU,” granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, or a “Pre-Signing RSU,” that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger shall automatically become fully vested (and for such Pre-
Signing RSUs subject to performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance). Each
vested Pre-Signing RSU, including those that become vested in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence
and in each case, with respect to which shares of common stock have not yet been issued, shall be canceled and
extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable withholding or other taxes,
or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the sum of
(A) the Price Per Share, plus (B) to the extent paid or payable to holders of common stock and payable but unpaid on
such Pre-Signing RSU, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (including, without duplication, any
accrued and unpaid dividends payable with respect to the restricted shares), multiplied by (ii) the total number of

Post-Signing RSUs. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each unvested RSU
granted on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, or a “Post-Signing RSU,” that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall receive the following
treatment:
•
For each former holder of a Post-Signing RSU who remains employed with Lockheed Martin or its affiliates
as of the grant date of the Lockheed Martin RSUs contemplated by this paragraph (which grant date shall
in all events be within 30 days of the closing date of the Merger), Lockheed Martin shall grant an award of
Lockheed Martin restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Lockheed Martin common
stock with a value equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such
canceled and forfeited Post-Signing RSUs (and for such Post-Signing RSUs subject to performance vesting
criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance), multiplied by (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and rounded up to the nearest whole number (such replacement awards,
the “Lockheed Martin RSUs”), where such Lockheed Martin RSUs shall be eligible to vest (1) to the extent
such Lockheed Martin RSU replaces a Post-Signing RSU subject solely to time-based vesting, on the same
vesting schedule applicable to such canceled and extinguished Post-Signing RSU, based on continued
service following the effective time of the Merger through each applicable vesting date, (2) to the extent
such Lockheed Martin RSU replaces a Post-Signing RSU subject to performance-based vesting, in full as of
the end of the performance period applicable to such canceled and extinguished Post-Signing RSU, based
on

continued service following the effective time of the Merger through such vesting date, and (3) in full upon
an earlier termination of employment or service by Lockheed Martin or its affiliates without cause or an
earlier resignation for good reason (as defined by the parties).
The “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means, with respect to each Post-Signing RSU, the quotient
determined by dividing (a) the sum of (i) the Price Per Share, plus (ii) to the extent paid to holders of
common stock and payable but unpaid on such Post-Signing RSU, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing
Dividend (including, without duplication, the amount of any dividend equivalent accrued on such Post-
Signing RSU) by (b) the volume weighted average of the closing sale prices per share of Lockheed Martin
common stock on the NYSE, as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal (or, if not
reported thereby, as reported in another authoritative source), on each of the five full consecutive trading
days ending on and including the third (3rd) business day prior to the closing date of the Merger.
•
For each former holder of a Post-Signing RSU who is employed by Aerojet Rocketdyne as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger and who does not remain employed with Lockheed Martin or its
affiliates as of the grant date of the Lockheed Martin RSUs, such former holder shall be entitled to receive
(subject to any applicable withholding or other taxes, or other amounts required by applicable law to be
withheld) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the sum of (1) the Price Per Share, plus (2) to the
extent paid to holders of common stock and payable but unpaid on such Post-Signing RSU, the amount per
share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (including, without duplication, the amount of any dividend equivalent
accrued on such Post-Signing RSU, if any), multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of common stock
subject to such canceled and forfeited Post-Signing RSU (and for such Post-Signing RSUs subject to
performance vesting criteria, based on deemed achievement of maximum performance), which amount shall
be made by the Surviving Corporation within ten business days after the termination of such former
holder’s employment.
Dividend Equivalents. In connection with the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, Aerojet Rocketdyne will accrue

Pre-Closing Dividend
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the same time and upon the same terms that the Pre-Closing Dividend is
paid to holders of common stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne shall pay the Pre-Closing Dividend to each holder of Aerojet
Rocketdyne convertible notes as of the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date, solely as a result of holding the Aerojet
Rocketdyne convertible notes and without having to convert the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes, in
accordance with the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture as if such holder of Aerojet Rocketdyne
convertible notes held a number of shares of common stock equal to the applicable conversion rate (as defined in the
convertible notes indenture) multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Aerojet Rocketdyne
convertible notes held by such holder. The Merger Agreement provides that, to the extent required pursuant to the
Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture, as a result of the per share value of the Pre-Closing Dividend
relative to the “Last Reported Sale Price” (as such term is defined in the convertible notes indenture) of our common
stock on December 18, 2020, the trading day preceding the date of the announcement for the Pre-Closing Dividend,
Aerojet Rocketdyne will take all necessary actions in accordance with the terms of the Aerojet Rocketdyne
convertible notes indenture to (i) notify holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes of the Pre-Closing Dividend
and (ii) permit any holder of Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes to surrender all or any portion of its Aerojet

Supplemental Indenture
The Merger Agreement provides that, to the extent required pursuant to the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes
indenture, prior to the closing of the Merger, Aerojet Rocketdyne will (i) (A) execute and deliver to the trustee under
the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture a supplemental indenture to the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible
notes indenture, which shall become effective and operative at the effective time of the Merger, providing, among
other things, that from and after the effective time of the Merger, the right of each holder of

Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible
notes shall be changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes solely
into the amount of cash that a holder of a number of shares of common stock equal to the applicable conversion rate
under the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
would have owned or have been entitled to receive in connection with the Merger, (B) deliver to the trustee an
officers’ certificate, opinion of counsel and any other documentation required to be provided pursuant to the Aerojet
Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture in connection with the execution of such supplemental indenture and (C)
cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be delivered to each holder of Aerojet Rocketdyne
convertible notes within 20 days of execution and effectiveness thereof in accordance with the terms of the Aerojet
Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture; and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee to execute such
supplemental indenture no later than the effective time of the Merger.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that Aerojet Rocketdyne and the Surviving Corporation in the Merger
shall take all actions that may be required in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, the Aerojet Rocketdyne
convertible notes indenture as a result of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated thereby, including (i) the giving of any notices that may be required in connection with
any repurchases or conversions of any convertible notes occurring as a result of the Merger constituting a
“Fundamental Change” and/or a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as such terms are defined in the convertible
notes indenture) and/or (ii) the delivery of any supplemental indentures, legal opinions, officers’ certificates or other
documentation or instruments required in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
Method of Settlement
The Merger Agreement provides that the method of settlement of Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes, whether in
cash, shares of common stock or a combination of both, shall be at the election of Aerojet Rocketdyne in accordance
with the terms of the Aerojet Rocketdyne convertible notes indenture.

demand and properly demand appraisal will not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but will instead be converted into the right to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares
of common stock as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If a holder fails to perfect, or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal of their shares of common stock, his, her or its shares will

business days after the closing date of the Merger), the paying agent will send each holder of record of a certificate
representing shares of common stock or of uncertificated shares of common stock immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger a customary letter of transmittal and instructions advising such holder as to how to surrender or
transfer such shares of common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The paying agent will promptly pay
such holders the Merger Consideration upon (i) the surrender of a certificate representing shares of common stock to
the paying agent (or compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the paying agent for transfer of
uncertificated shares) and (ii) delivery of a properly completed
101TABLE OF CONTENTS
letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the paying agent or Lockheed Martin. Interest
will not be paid or accrue in respect of cash payments. The amount of any cash payments paid to you will be reduced
by any applicable withholding taxes. You should not surrender your shares of common stock without a letter of
transmittal.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of common stock that are
not registered in the transfer records of Aerojet Rocketdyne, payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the holder in whose name the stock certificate formerly representing such shares or uncertificated
shares is registered if: (1) any such stock certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a person other than such holder (or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Lockheed Martin that such bonds and taxes have been paid or are not
applicable).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Lockheed
Martin may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect
to the shares of common stock previously represented by such stock certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed stock certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as
Lockheed Martin may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the paying agent, Lockheed
Martin or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such stock certificate.

Other than as expressly allowed by the Merger Agreement, under the Merger Agreement, Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed
not to (and to not publicly propose to), agreed to ensure that its subsidiaries do not (and do not publicly propose to),
and agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause Aerojet Rocketdyne’s and its subsidiaries’ respective
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly induce any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or
Acquisition Inquiry (as defined below);
•
furnish or otherwise provide access to any information regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its
subsidiaries to any person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry;
•
enter into, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with or knowingly cooperate with, any person
(other than Lockheed Martin, its affiliates and its and their representatives) with respect to any Acquisition

•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or similar document or
contract constituting or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction (other than certain confidentiality
agreements entered into pursuant to, and in compliance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement).
However, the Merger Agreement provides that the foregoing does not prohibit Aerojet Rocketdyne, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives (in the case of representatives, to the extent they are acting at
the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its subsidiaries) from contacting in writing any person who, following
the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
stockholders, makes an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry to Aerojet
Rocketdyne that did not result from a material breach of the terms of the Merger Agreement, solely to ask such
person, and to request from such person a written response to, a question or questions for the sole purpose of
clarifying (and not for the purpose of engaging, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations regarding)
the written terms of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; provided, that prior to sending any such
written communication to such person, Aerojet Rocketdyne shall deliver to Lockheed Martin a copy of such written
communication.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Aerojet Rocketdyne: (i) agreed that it will not, and it shall ensure that none of
subsidiaries will, release or permit the release of any person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver
of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no-hire, “standstill” or similar agreement or provision to
which Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its subsidiaries is or becomes a party or under which any of Aerojet Rocketdyne
or any of its subsidiaries has or acquires any rights; and (ii) will use its reasonable best
107TABLE OF CONTENTS
efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of Lockheed Martin;
provided, however, that Aerojet Rocketdyne may release a person from, or amend or waive any provision of, any
“standstill” or similar agreement or provision if: (A) such person confidentially approaches Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
board of directors; (B) Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to release such person from such agreement or provision
or the failure to amend such agreement or waive such provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders under applicable Delaware Law; and (C) Aerojet Rocketdyne provides
Lockheed Martin with written notice of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s intent to take such action prior to taking such action.
“Acquisition Inquiry” means an inquiry (other than an inquiry made or submitted by or on behalf of Lockheed Martin
or any of its subsidiaries) that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and “Acquisition
Proposal” means any offer, indication of interest or proposal (other than an offer or proposal made or submitted by or
on behalf of Lockheed Martin or any of its subsidiaries) contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction.
“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of transactions (other than the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement) involving:

defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder) of persons (in each case, other than
Lockheed Martin and its subsidiaries) directly or indirectly acquires beneficial ownership (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or record ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock
or securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding securities of any class of capital stock of Aerojet
Rocketdyne or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined below); or (ii) in which Aerojet Rocketdyne or any
Significant Subsidiary issues securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding common stock or
securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding securities of any class of capital stock of Aerojet
Rocketdyne or any Significant Subsidiary (or instruments convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for 20% or more of any class of capital stock of Aerojet Rocketdyne or any Significant Subsidiaries);
•
any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, sublicense, acquisition or disposition of any business or
businesses or assets that constitute or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues,
consolidated net income or consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured based on the 12 full
calendar months prior to the date of determination) or 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Aerojet
Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured based on fair market value as of the last day of
the most recently completed calendar month); or
•
any liquidation or dissolution of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
“Significant Subsidiary” means any direct or indirect subsidiary of Aerojet Rocketdyne that owns assets that
constitute or account for 10% or more of the consolidated net revenues or consolidated net income of Aerojet

determination) or 10% or more of the consolidated assets of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries taken as a whole
(measured based on the fair market value as of the last day of the most recently completed calendar month).
The Merger Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement
by Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders, Aerojet Rocketdyne may furnish or otherwise provide access to any
information (including non-public information) regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries to, and may enter
into discussions or negotiations and cooperate with, any person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to Aerojet Rocketdyne after the date of the Merger Agreement by such
person (and not withdrawn) if: (i) such Acquisition Proposal was not obtained or made as a result of a material breach
of any of the provisions set forth in the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger Agreement; (ii) Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel,
108
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer (as defined
below); (iii) Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors determines in good faith, after considering the advice of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders under Delaware law; (iv) prior to first furnishing any non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person, Aerojet Rocketdyne (A) gives
Lockheed Martin written notice of the identity of such person and of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s intention to furnish non-
public information to, or to enter into discussions or negotiations with, such person; and (B) receives from such
person, and delivers to Lockheed Martin a copy of, an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions no
less favorable to Aerojet Rocketdyne than the provisions of the confidentiality agreement between Aerojet
Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin as in effect immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (and which
does not prevent Aerojet Rocketdyne from complying with its obligations under the Merger Agreement or result in a
breach if Aerojet Rocketdyne complies with its obligations under the Merger Agreement); and (v) substantially
contemporaneous with furnishing any non-public information to such person, Aerojet Rocketdyne furnishes such
non-public information to Lockheed Martin (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously
furnished or made available by Aerojet Rocketdyne to Lockheed Martin).
The term “Superior Offer” means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for this purpose the
references to “20%” in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references to “50%”) by a
third party that: (a) was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a material breach of the non-solicitation
and related provisions of the Merger Agreement, (b) is not subject to a financing contingency and (c) Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s outside legal counsel, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders than the Merger, in each case taking into account at the
time of determination all relevant circumstances, including the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors in good faith considers to be appropriate.
The Merger Agreement also contains covenants obligating Aerojet Rocketdyne to advise Lockheed Martin as to the
status of, and provide information to Lockheed Martin with respect to, any Acquisition Proposals or Acquisition
Inquiries received.

As of the date of this proxy statement, the Company’s board of directors knows of no matters that will be presented
for consideration at the Special Meeting other than as described in this proxy statement.
The Company currently expects to complete the Merger in the second half of 2021. As such, the Company expects to
hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2021 (the “2021 Annual Meeting”).
A stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal for consideration at the 2021 Annual Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8
of the Exchange Act (“Rule 14a-8”) and desires for that proposal to appear in the Company’s proxy materials for that
meeting must comply with Rule 14a-8. Generally, a stockholder is required to submit the proposal in writing to the
Chairman of the Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee, c/o Secretary, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.,
222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245, 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date
the proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting was first released to stockholders, meaning the Company
was required to receive such proposal no later than November 27, 2020. If, however, the 2021 Annual Meeting is held
more than 30 days later than the anniversary of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company will provide
notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2021 Annual Meeting will be held, and a stockholder
may submit a proposal for consideration pursuant to Rule 14a-8 within a reasonable time before the Company begins
to print and send its proxy materials for the 2021 Annual Meeting.
Stockholders who wish to present proposals of other business at the 2021 Annual Meeting without inclusion of that
proposal in the Company’s proxy materials, but instead for presentation directly at that meeting, must comply with
the requirements set forth in the Bylaws. In part, these Bylaws require that for such other business to be properly
brought before the 2021 Annual Meeting a stockholder must have provided written notice to the Company at the
address above no later than the close of business on February 5, 2021, nor earlier than the close of business on
January 6, 2021. In the event that the date of the 2021 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70
days after the anniversary date of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders notice by the stockholder must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting, or the 10th day following the day
on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company.
Stockholders may contact the Corporate Secretary at Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc., 222 N. Pacific Coast
Highway, El Segundo, California 90245 for a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for
making stockholder proposals. Additionally, a copy of our bylaws is available on our website at

Members of the Board:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock
of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (“AR Holdings”) of the Merger Consideration (defined below) to be received
by such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Merger Agreement”), proposed to be entered into among AR Holdings, Lockheed Martin Corporation
(“Parent”), and Mizar Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As more fully described in the
Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into AR Holdings (the “Merger”) and (ii) each
outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of AR Holdings (“AR Holdings Common Stock”)
other than shares of AR Holdings Common stock (x) held by AR Holdings or any wholly owned subsidiary of AR
Holdings, (y) held in AR Holdings’ treasury or (z) held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $56.00 minus, to the extent paid, the
amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the “Merger Consideration”).
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated December 17, 2020 of the Merger Agreement and held
discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of AR Holdings concerning
the business, operations and prospects of AR Holdings. We examined certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to AR Holdings as well as certain financial forecasts reflecting a base case and an
adjusted base case (the “Forecasts”), and other information and data relating to AR Holdings which were provided to
or discussed with us by the management of AR Holdings. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth
in the Merger Agreement in relation to, among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes
of AR Holdings Common Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of AR Holdings; and
the capitalization and financial condition of AR Holdings. We considered, to the extent publicly available, the
financial terms of certain other transactions which we considered relevant in evaluating the Merger and analyzed
certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of other companies
whose operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of AR Holdings. In addition to the foregoing, we
conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and
market criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized
by our fairness opinion committee.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed
by or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of AR Holdings that they are not aware of any
relevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us. With respect to each of the Forecasts
and other information and data relating to AR Holdings provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us,
we have been advised by the management of AR Holdings that such forecasts and other information and data were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
AR Holdings as to the future financial performance of AR Holdings under the scenario reflected therein.

We have assumed, with your consent, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms, conditions
and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term,
condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals,
consents and releases for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an
adverse effect on the Merger meaningful to our opinion and analysis. Representatives of AR Holdings have advised
us, and we further have assumed, with your consent, that the final terms of the Merger Agreement will not vary
materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by us. We have not made or been provided with an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of AR Holdings nor have we made any
physical inspection of the properties or assets of AR Holdings. We were not requested to, and we did not, solicit
third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of AR Holdings, nor were we requested to
consider, and our opinion does not address, the underlying business decision of AR Holdings to effect the Merger,
the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for AR Holdings
or the effect of any other transaction in which AR Holdings might engage. We also express no view as to, and our
opinion does not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons,
relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information available to us,
and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date hereof. As you are aware,
the credit, financial and stock markets, the industries in which AR Holdings operates, and the securities of AR
Holdings have experienced and may continue to experience volatility and we express no view or opinion as to any
potential effects of such volatility on AR Holdings or the Merger.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has acted as financial advisor to AR Holdings in connection with the proposed Merger
and will receive a fee for such services, of which a portion is payable upon delivery of this opinion and the principal
portion is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, AR Holdings has agreed to reimburse our
expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. As you also are aware, although
we and our affiliates have not provided investment banking, commercial banking or other similar financial services to
AR Holdings during the past two years for which we and our affiliates received compensation, we and our affiliates in
the future may provide such services to AR Holdings and/or its affiliates, for which services we and our affiliates
would expect to receive compensation. As you further are aware, we and our affiliates in the past have provided, and
currently provide, services to Parent unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we and such affiliates
have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to
the date hereof, having acted as joint bookrunner for an offering of senior notes by Parent in May 2020. In the
ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of AR Holdings and
Parent for our own account or for the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities. In addition, we and our affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain
relationships with AR Holdings, Parent and their respective affiliates.
Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information of the Board of Directors of
AR Holdings in its evaluation of the proposed Merger, and our opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute
a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the
proposed Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described above and
other factors we deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of AR Holdings Common Stock.
Very truly yours,

Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “Acquiror”) and Mizar Sub, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares owned by the Acquiror or
the Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $56.00 minus, to the extent paid, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the
Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of
the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we
deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts' estimates and reviewed certain
additional business and financial information made available to us by the Company;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us
by management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company, including the Base Case
Forecasts and the Adjusted Base Case Forecasts (collectively, the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the
Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts, including
their views on the alternative business scenarios underlying the Base Case Forecasts and the Adjusted
Base Case Forecasts, respectively;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of
certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger
with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed
relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 17, 2020, of the Merger
Agreement; and
(viii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.

For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,
discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed
responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the
assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Base Case Forecasts and the Adjusted Base
Case Forecasts, respectively, we have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the
future financial performance of the Company in the alternative business scenarios underlying the Base Case
Forecasts and the Adjusted Base Case Forecasts, respectively. We express no view as to the Base Case Forecasts
and the Adjusted Base Case Forecasts or the alternative business scenarios or other assumptions on which they are
based.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the final
executed Agreement will not differ from the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the representations
and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all
of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions
to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have further assumed,
in all respects material to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases
necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition
that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the contemplated
benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger. As you are aware, the credit, financial and
stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no opinion or view as to any potential
effects of such volatility on the parties or the Merger. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification,
on the assessments of the management of the Company as to (i) the validity of, and risks associated with, the
Company's intellectual property, technology, products and services, and (ii) the marketability, commercial viability
and market adoption of the Company’s current and future products and services.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made or
assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company
under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based
upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as
they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of the Company Common Stock. We do not
express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative
to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our
opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without
limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our
opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that
might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage
in the Merger. In arriving at our opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third
party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the Company Common Stock or any business combination or
other extraordinary transaction involving the Company. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the
Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the
Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the

Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common Stock will trade at
any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the
Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company
to pay its obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed
the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory,
accounting and tax matters.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent
upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us
against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore
Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company
and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. In addition, during the two-year
period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial
advisory or other services to the Acquiror and we have not received any compensation from the Acquiror during
such period. We may provide financial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror in the future, and
in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own accounts and the
accounts of customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research,
private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or
otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their respective employees, as well as investment
funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short
positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt
or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to the
Company, the Acquiror, potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or persons that are
competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company or the Acquiror.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of this
opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for
any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval, except the Company may reproduce this opinion in
full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and required to be
mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be
received by holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
Very truly yours,
EVERCORE GROUP L.L.C.

(ii) except as provided in Section 1.5(a)(i) and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.7 and 1.8, each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) $56.00 minus (B) to the extent paid (or, in the event
that the Closing Date occurs after the Pre-Closing Dividend Record Date but before the Dividend

acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the “Paying Agent”). At the Closing,
subject to Section 1.8, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash sufficient
to make payments of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 (other than payments of
any Restricted Share Merger Consideration in respect of which there is a Tax withholding obligation) (the
“Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent and any
and all interest and other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent; provided, however, that (i) any such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than thirty
(30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States;
and (ii) no investment of the Payment Fund shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from paying the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and following any Losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of such
Losses to the extent the funds in the Payment Fund are insufficient for such purposes, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.
(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after the Closing
Date), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company
Stock Certificates or Uncertificated Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form and containing such provisions (A) as Parent may reasonably specify as to title,
authorization, execution and delivery (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock
Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) and (B) as otherwise are
reasonably acceptable to the Company; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company
Stock Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange (or compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for transfer of Uncertificated Shares), together
with the delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered or
transferred shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common
Stock that are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of Merger Consideration may
be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly
representing such shares or Uncertificated Shares is registered if: (1) any such Company Stock Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid
any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered
or transferred as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate and each
Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen
A-3TABLE OF CONTENTS
or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such
sum as Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or in
respect of Uncertificated Shares.
(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock as of the date that is three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have
not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates, or complied with the procedures established
by the Paying Agent for transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in accordance with this Section 1.7, thereafter
shall look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration.
(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or any Company Equity Award such amounts as Parent
determines to be required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts otherwise would have been paid.
(e) If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered, or any Uncertificated Share has not been
transferred, by the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such Company Stock
Certificate or Uncertificated Share represents the right to receive otherwise would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, then such cash amount shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and without any action by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.
(f) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration
delivered to any public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar applicable Law.
(g) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be paid, through Parent’s or the Surviving
Corporation’s standard payroll practices, to each holder of a share of Company Restricted Stock with
respect to which there is a Tax withholding obligation, the applicable Restricted Share Merger
Consideration, without interest.

shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand for appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who otherwise has
complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as

thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares or, if such shares are

be deposited in the Payment Fund additional cash in an amount sufficient to pay such Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, to the extent there are insufficient funds in the Payment Fund
to pay such Merger Consideration.
(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL and any withdrawal of any such demand; and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand,
at Parent’s sole cost and expense. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its
prior written consent to such payment or settlement offer, and shall not be obligated to make any such
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time pursuant to any negotiations and proceedings

contemporaneous with furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes such

any of its Representatives) on the other hand shall constitute material amendments)) setting forth the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including any subsequent material written
amendments thereto and copies of material written proposals and proposed agreements relating thereto.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the
status of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the material terms thereof) and
any material modification or proposed material modification thereto and the status of any discussions or
negotiations relating thereto. With regard to any meeting of the Company’s board of directors at which the
board is expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, the Company shall provide
advance notice of such meeting to Parent immediately following the time that notice is provided to the
members of the Company’s board of directors.

Company: (i) agrees that it will not, and it shall ensure that none of the other Acquired Companies will,
release or permit the release of any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any

enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of Parent; provided, however, that the Company
may release a Person from, or amend or waive any provision of, any “standstill” or similar agreement or
provision if: (A) such Person confidentially approaches the Company’s board of directors; (B) the
Company’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal
counsel, that the failure to release such Person from such

inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Delaware Law;
and (C) the Company provides Parent with written notice of the Company’s intent to take such action prior
to taking such action.
(f) Within two (2) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall request each Person

effect) in connection with such Person’s consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the
Acquired Companies or any Representative of an Acquired Company to the extent that the Company is
entitled to have such documents returned or destroyed; provided, however, that the Company shall have

information.

any provision set forth in this Section 4.4 or in Section 5.2 shall be deemed to constitute a breach of such
provision by the Company.
(h) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may not furnish non-public information regarding the
Acquired Companies to, and may not enter into discussions or negotiations with, any Person (other than

of the Company’s board of directors to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Delaware Law;
and (H) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company’s board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company

order to accept such Superior Offer, would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the

of such Superior Offer; provided, however, that when making such determination, the Company’s
board of directors shall be obligated to consider any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing as a result of the negotiations required by clause (G) above; and
(ii) the Company’s board of directors may effect a Company Change in Recommendation under clause
(A) of the definition thereof if: (A) there shall arise after the date of this Agreement a material event,

withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, with a written notice specifying the date
and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a reasonably detailed description
of such Change in Circumstances; (C) the Company’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the
Company’s outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, the failure to effect a
Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company’s stockholders under applicable Delaware Law; (D) no less than three (3) Business Days
prior to effecting such Company Change in Recommendation, the Company’s board of directors
delivers to Parent a written notice describing in reasonable detail the Change in Circumstances, stating
that it intends to effect such Company Change in Recommendation in light of such Change in
Circumstances and describing any intended modification of the Company Board Recommendation; (E)
throughout such three (3) Business Day period, the Company engages (to the extent requested by
Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
failure to effect such Company Change in Recommendation would not be inconsistent with the
fiduciary obligations of the Company’s board of directors to the Company’s stockholders under
applicable Delaware Law in light of such Change in Circumstances; and (F) following the end of such

provided, however, that when making such determination, the Company’s board of directors shall be
obligated to consider any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing as a

of the consideration payable (including any modification in any proposed dividend payable in
connection therewith) in connection with a Superior Offer, and any other material change to the terms
of a Superior Offer, will be deemed to be a new Superior Offer, requiring a new Recommendation
Change Notice and a new advance notice period; provided, however, that, in each case, any
references to three (3) Business Days in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 5.2(d) shall then
and thereafter be deemed to be references to two (2) Business Days rather than three (3) Business
Days. The Company shall ensure that any Company Change in Recommendation under clause (A) of
the definition thereof: (x) does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the
Company’s board of directors or any other approval of the Company’s board of directors; and (y)
does not have the effect of causing any corporate Takeover Statute of the State of Delaware or any
other state to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions. The Company agrees to keep confidential, and not to disclose to the public or to any
Person (other than its Representatives), any and all information regarding any negotiations that take

(a) In respect of the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (or upon the earlier termination of a Continuing Employee’s employment), Parent shall provide
or cause to be provided to each employee who is employed by the Acquired Companies as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Employees”), (i) at least the same base wage rate
or base salary in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) at least the same
target annual cash incentive opportunities (excluding any equity-based, long-term incentive, retention,
change in control or similar compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) other employee benefits (excluding any equity-based, long-term incentive, retention,
change in control or similar compensation, one-time or special benefits or arrangements, severance,
nonqualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and post-retirement health and
welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those in effect with respect to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) severance benefits that are at least
the same as those in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, provided, however, that severance benefits provided to a similarly situated employee of Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent shall be deemed to be at least the same as those in effect with respect to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compensation and employee benefits for Continuing Employees covered by a Collective Bargaining
Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be provided in accordance with the applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement as in effect from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall
not be prohibited by this Section 5.7(a) from terminating the employment of or changing or modifying the
terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date.
(b) Parent shall assume all liabilities for unpaid accrued paid time off, including vacation time, for each
Continuing Employee, giving service credit under Parent’s paid time off policy for service with the
Company as of immediately prior to the Closing, and shall permit each Continuing Employee to use their
paid time off entitlement accrued as of the Closing Date in accordance with the Parent’s policies for
carrying over unused vacation and/or paid time off, and, to the extent that such accrued
A-48TABLE OF CONTENTS
paid time off for any Continuing Employee exceeds the capped amounts permitted under Parent’s policies,
Parent shall either provide a cash payment to such Continuing Employee equal to the value of such excess
paid time off, if permitted by applicable Law, or require that such Continuing Employee use such excess
paid time off within a reasonable period of time after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive duplicative credit for
the same period of service.
(c) If requested by Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a “Company 401(k)
Plan”), in each case, subject to applicable Laws and with respect to requirements imposed by Collective
Bargaining Agreements. If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the
Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the
Company’s board of directors (or such person or persons authorized to take such actions) of resolutions
authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject
to the prior review and approval of Parent), effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the
Merger becomes effective. The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request and as may be required in accordance with
applicable Law. If the distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k) Plan that is terminated
pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) are reasonably anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such
Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any participating employer, then the Company shall take
such actions as are necessary to estimate the amount of such charges or other fees and provide its
estimate of that amount in writing to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Subject
to the Company’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and subject the
standards set forth in Part 5.7(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, Parent may request in writing at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date that any other Company Employee Plan (other than the 2009
Benefits Restoration Plan for the Aerojet Rocketdyne 401(k) Plan) be terminated prior to the Effective Time,
and the Company shall take such actions described in the preceding sentences of this Section 5.7(b) with
respect to such Company Employee Plan, other than those described in the immediately preceding
sentence. Parent shall take reasonable actions to cause a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
established or designated by Parent (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”), including, if necessary, making amendments
to the Parent 401(k) Plan, to accept rollover contributions from the Continuing Employees of any account
balances (inclusive of any plan loans) in cash or notes (in the case of loans) distributed to them by the
Company 401(k) Plan, except if acceptance of such rollover contributions would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the qualified status of such Parent 401(k) Plan. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this subsection shall eliminate or reduce the obligations to the Continuing Employees
of Section 5.7(a).
(d) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are imposed by applicable Laws
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions, including with respect to requirements imposed by
Collective Bargaining Agreements, the Company shall consult with Parent and shall ensure that such
notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, none of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates shall communicate with
Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters, including post-Closing employee
benefits and compensation or other compensation or benefits matters related to or impacted by any of the
Contemplated Transactions (whether alone or in combination with additional events), including the matters
described in this Section 5.7, without the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent retains the right, in its reasonable and good faith
discretion after discussions with the Company, to approve or reject any tentative agreements reached in
connection with notification or consultation requirements.
(e) Parent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to permit each Continuing Employee to either
continue to participate from and after the Closing Date in the Company Employee Plans or be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing Date in benefit plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

To the extent Parent causes a Continuing Employee to cease to be eligible to participate in a Company
Employee Plan and instead provides for such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in a benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates during the calendar year of Closing (the
“Replacement Plans”), if such Replacement Plan is a group health plan, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to credit (or cause to be credited) such Continuing Employee, for the year during which
such coverage under such Replacement Plan begins, with any deductibles and copayments already
incurred during such year under the comparable Company Employee Plan. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, their Affiliates, and the Replacement Plans shall recognize each Continuing Employee’s years
of service with the Acquired Companies (including service with any other employer that was recognized by
any of the Acquired Companies) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and, solely for purposes of paid time off
and severance benefits, benefit determination (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or eligibility for any retiree health or welfare benefit) under the Replacement Plans, to the
extent such service was credited under the corresponding Company Employee Plan prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Replacement Plan to waive any
preexisting condition exclusion or restriction with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to a Continuing Employee to the extent such exclusion or restriction did not apply with respect
to such employee under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.
(f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
assume, and honor their respective obligations under, any Company Employee Plan set forth on Part 5.7(f)
of the Disclosure Schedule, but subject to any provisions thereof related to termination or amendment of
such agreements and plans.
(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to amend the Company Deferred Compensation Plans and any other Company Employee Plans
set forth on Part 5.7(g) of the Disclosure Schedule in the manner contemplated by Part 5.7(g) of the
Disclosure Schedule, effective as of the Closing Date, and the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the
Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company’s board of directors of resolutions
authorizing such amendments.
(h) To the extent that participants in the Company’s annual cash bonus plans set forth on Part 5.7(h) of the
Disclosure Schedule (the “Bonus Plans”) have not been paid their applicable bonuses with respect to the
2021 performance year (the “Bonuses”) prior to, at or in connection with the Effective Time, Parent shall
pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, in cash on or before March 15 of the year following the
2021 performance year, to each Qualified Continuing Employee (as defined below) who is a participant in a
Bonus Plan, on a prorated basis for each day employed during the performance year, such Qualified
Continuing Employee’s Bonus paid in accordance with the objective terms and performance criteria of the
Bonus Plans calculated based on the Company’s performance through the Closing Date, and thereafter,
calculated as if target performance was achieved through December 31 of the applicable year, subject to
any modifications set forth in Part 5.7(h) of the Disclosure Schedule. A “Qualified Continuing Employee”
means (i) each Continuing Employee who is employed as of an applicable Bonus Plan payment date, and
(ii) each Continuing Employee whose employment with the Surviving Corporation is terminated by the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time and prior to such Bonus Plan payment date for a reason
other than “cause” or who terminated employment with the Surviving Corporation for “good reason”

Surviving Corporation’s long-term disability plan or similar program).

are available under and consistent with applicable Delaware Law) in accordance with their terms and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified during such period in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.

efforts to cooperate with the Company in connection with the Company obtaining, a prepaid “tail” (i)
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy or policies and (ii) fiduciary liability insurance policy or

to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions)
from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s insurance
carrier(s) as of the date of this Agreement, and that are no less favorable to the insureds (including as to
terms, coverages, conditions, retentions and limits of liability) than the coverage provided under the
Company’s existing policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance as

best available coverage), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full
force and effect and be prepaid for the full term of six (6) years and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation; provided that the Company shall not pay (i) annual premiums for
such “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy or policies in excess of an aggregate amount of

insurance policy or policies in excess of an aggregate amount of 300% of the last annual premiums paid by
the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for its existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, but in
each such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for each such respective 300%
aggregate amounts. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies prior to or
as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the then-current (as of the Effective Time) policies of directors’
and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (to the extent
such policies can be obtained by the Surviving Corporation) with respect to acts, omissions or events
occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to
pay (i) annual premiums for such directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in excess of an aggregate

its existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies and (ii) annual premiums for such fiduciary
liability insurance in excess of an aggregate

each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives (each of whom is an
intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.8) from and after the Effective Time and (ii) shall not be

any event no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, make all required filings of Notification and

which any of the Acquired Companies are operating any business) or third parties in connection with the

(iv) timely make all such filings, (v) use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents and approvals required to be obtained (including under the HSR Act and the Antitrust Laws of
any other jurisdiction) from any Governmental Authorities or third parties in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (vi) supply as
promptly as practicable such information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to any
Antitrust Law by any Governmental Authority, (vii) take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid
any proceeding by any Governmental Authority or third party in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, (viii) use reasonable best efforts to accomplish the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 6 and Section 7 hereof, (ix) coordinate with each other in preparing and exchanging all
information in connection with the foregoing and (x) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the Parties shall be responsible for
its own fees and expenses, except that the filing fees of the Parties associated with filings under the HSR
Act and any other Antitrust Laws shall be borne by Parent.
(b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall promptly supply the other with any information which may be required in order to
A-52TABLE OF CONTENTS
effectuate any filings (including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its obligations set
forth in) Section 5.9(a). Without limiting the generality of Section 5.9(a), the Parties further agree to (i)
consult with each other in good faith prior to taking a position with respect to any filing or submission
required by Section 5.9(a), (ii) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any
Governmental Authority relating to the Antitrust Laws, (iii) to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, not participate independently in any such meeting without first giving the other
Parties (or the other Parties’ outside counsel) an opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, (iv)
to the extent practicable, give the other Parties reasonable advance notice of all oral communications with
any Governmental Authority relating to Antitrust Laws, (v) if any Governmental Authority initiates an oral
communication regarding the Antitrust Laws, promptly notify the other Parties of the substance of such
communication, (vi) provide each of the other Parties with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with all analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, proposals and other written communications and
materials to be made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party to any Governmental Authority in
connection with any filing or submission under any Antitrust Laws or otherwise relating to any
proceedings under any Antitrust Laws and (vii) promptly provide each of the other Parties with copies of
all written communications to or from any Governmental Authority relating to the Antitrust Laws, except
that the Parties are not required to share their respective HSR Act filings. The Parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other Parties
under this Section 5.9(b) as “outside counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel and outside economic consultants of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel or outside economic consultants to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient without the advance written consent of the Party providing such materials.
(c) The Company shall not, but Parent may if in its good faith judgment it determines (after consulting in
advance with the Company and in good faith taking the Company’s and its outside counsel’s views into
account) that the taking of such action would materially enhance the likelihood of obtaining any necessary
clearance under the Antitrust Laws by the Outside Date, reduce the time necessary to achieve such
clearance, or reduce the burdens on the Parties in achieving such clearance, extend any waiting period or
agree to refile under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. If the relevant government agency requests a
timing agreement or other similar arrangement that would alter the statutory or regulatory waiting or
suspension period, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith with the agency to reach agreement on that
timing agreement consistent with customary practice in a manner that enhances the likelihood of obtaining
any necessary clearance under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws by the Outside Date.
(d) The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any
requests or inquiries received from any Governmental Authority or any other authority enforcing
applicable Antitrust Laws for additional information or documentation in connection with their review.
Without limiting the generality of Section 5.9(a), each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, respond to and certify “Substantial Compliance” with any
request for additional information or documentary material issued by a Governmental Authority under 15
U.S.C. Sect. 18a(e) in conjunction with the Contemplated Transactions.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to dispose of or hold separate, or agree to dispose of or hold separate, license or restrict
its ownership and operation of, all or any portion of the business or assets of the Acquired Companies or
Parent and its Subsidiaries, except that Parent shall be required, if necessary to obtain regulatory approval
from any Governmental Authority necessary for consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, to
divest, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of businesses or assets of any of the Acquired
Companies in connection with or after the Closing that, in the aggregate, generated less than $280 million in
sales in the Company’s fiscal year 2020, without regard to consideration received, in order to obtain merger
clearance from any Governmental Authority under any applicable Antitrust Laws and otherwise enable the
Contemplated Transactions to be consummated prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that in no
event will Parent be obligated to divest any business or assets of the Acquired Companies (x) exclusively
associated with any one or more of the
A-53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
organizations identified in Annex 5.9(e)(x) or (y) located at or managed by any one or more of the facilities
identified in Annex 5.9(e)(y). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not in any way restrict any acquisition by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any Entities, or shares of
capital stock, assets, businesses or facilities of any other Person (and for the avoidance of doubt, no such
acquisition by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be inconsistent with or in breach of
Parent’s obligations under this Section 5.9) provided, however, that Parent shall not (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to) acquire, enter into or be bound by any agreement to acquire, or announce any
acquisition of any equity interests of any Entity or company that engages in, or any assets, businesses or
facilities that engage in, the research, development, manufacture or sale of propulsion systems for missiles,
hypersonic vehicles or space systems (unless such propulsion systems are acquired as complete
propulsion systems or subsystems from an unrelated third Person and incorporated into a product sold by
such entities, companies or acquired businesses).
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the other provisions of this
Section 5.9 (including, for avoidance of doubt, the limitations on the amount of and type of divestitures
specified in Section 5.9(e)), the Parties understand and agree that Parent’s reasonable best efforts shall
include, if necessary to obtain regulatory clearance, entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent
decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions requiring Parent to accept behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions and similar
commitments consisting of (x) acting as a non-discriminatory merchant supplier of components or other
products of the Acquired Companies, and (y) establishing firewalls to protect third-party data received by
the Acquired Companies and including in the case of (x) and (y) agreeing to other ancillary terms to
effectuate those merchant supply and firewall commitments (including, by way of example, compliance
reporting and accepting and paying for a compliance monitor); provided, however, that the merchant
supply and firewall commitments in (x) and (y) and such ancillary terms shall be consistent with those
described in Annex 5.9(f); and provided further that in no event will Parent be obligated to accept or agree
to enter into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions requiring Parent (i) to provide any of the
Acquired Companies’ products or services to third parties without charging a profit or fee, (ii) to charge a
fee or profit for sales or transfers of products or services from the Acquired Companies for use on products
of bids offered by Parent or its Subsidiaries; or (iii) to hold separate or refrain from integrating with one or
more business units or organizations of Parent any of the Acquired Companies or their businesses, assets
or operations (such required behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions and similar commitments referred
to in clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence (and the related ancillary terms referred to above), together with
the divestitures, holding separates and dispositions required by Section 5.9(e), collectively, the “Permitted
Restrictions”).
(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 5.9(b), Parent shall
have the unilateral right to determine whether or not the Parties will litigate with any Governmental
Authorities to oppose any enforcement action seeking any action on the part of Parent other than
Permitted Restrictions or remove any court or regulatory orders impeding the ability to consummate the
Merger.
(h) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Parent shall lead all communications, strategy and
efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions and consents from Governmental Authorities under
Antitrust Laws in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and any litigation matters with third
parties relating to the Antitrust Laws (provided that the Company is not prohibited from complying with
applicable Law), subject to good faith consultations with the Company and the inclusion of the Company
at meetings with Governmental Authorities with respect to any discussion related to the Contemplated
Transactions under the Antitrust Laws. For avoidance of doubt, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, Parent shall also control the timing for various steps and actions to obtain all necessary
actions or non-actions and consents from Governmental Authorities under Antitrust Laws in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions and any litigation matters with third

provide all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of any
debt financing in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; provided, that nothing herein shall

that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation of, any of their organizational

any of the Acquired Companies to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, certificates, documents

any definitive financing agreement in respect thereof; or (y) disclose any information to Parent or any
financing source if such disclosure would (I) violate any applicable Law or (II) jeopardize the attorney
client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege held by any Acquired Company. Parent
covenants and agrees, upon request of the Company, to promptly reimburse the Company for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by any Acquired Company
or its Representatives in connection with any cooperation contemplated by this Section 5.10, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of
any such debt financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any
historical financial statements provided by any of the Acquired Companies and except with respect to any
fraud or intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such Persons. It is understood and
agreed that, if needed, Parent shall be responsible for the preparation of any pro forma financial statements
and pro forma adjustments giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions for use in connection with the
offering and closing of the debt financing, it being understood that the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in the preparation of such pro forma information to the extent its cooperation relates to customary
and reasonably requested financial information and data readily available from the Company’s historical
books and records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.10(b), nothing will require

assist in the preparation of), in each case prior to the

officers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal or
modification of this Article TENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as
such directors and officers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective
Time existing at the time of such repeal or modification or with respect to events occurring prior to
such time.
 
(B) Each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in
any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a
“proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she was a director or officer of the Corporation prior to
the Effective Time or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise prior to the
Effective Time, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such director, officer, employee, or agent, or in
any other capacity while serving as such director, officer, employee, or agent, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the DGCL
permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability, and loss
(including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, other expenses and losses, amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or
agent, and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, and administrators; provided,
however, that, except as provided in paragraph (B) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article TENTH shall be a contract right and shall include the right of
a director or officer of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as such directors and
officers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time to be paid by
the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a
director or officer of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as such directors and
officers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by
such person while a director or officer including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit
plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, which undertaking shall itself be sufficient without the need for further
evaluation of any credit aspects of the undertaking or with respect to such advancement, by or on
behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Article TENTH or otherwise.

(C) If a claim under paragraph (B) of this Article TENTH is not paid in full by the Corporation within
sixty (60) days after a written claim, together with reasonable evidence as to the amount of such claim,
has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses
(including attorneys’ fees), in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the claimant
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim, and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense,
including attorneys’ fees, of prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit, other than a
suit brought to enforce a claim for expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has
been tendered to the Corporation, that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it
permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but
the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to
the suit or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In
any suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses
hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification, or to
such advancement of expenses, under this Article TENTH or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
 
(D) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in
advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article TENTH shall not be exclusive of any other
right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaw, agreement, or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
 
(E) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee, or agent of the Corporation in respect of his or her acts or omissions as such directors and
officers and fiduciaries occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to, at or after the Effective Time or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any such expense,
liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
against such expense, liability, or loss under the DGCL.
 
(F) In the case of a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses against the Corporation
under this Article TENTH arising out of acts, events, or circumstances for which the claimant, who
was at the relevant time serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent of any other entity at the
request of the Corporation prior to the Effective Time, may be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to such other entity’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or other
governing document, or a contractual agreement between the claimant and such entity, the claimant
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder shall first seek indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to any such governing document or agreement. To the extent that
amounts to be paid in indemnification or advancement to a claimant hereunder are paid by such other
entity, the claimant’s right to indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder shall be
reduced.
