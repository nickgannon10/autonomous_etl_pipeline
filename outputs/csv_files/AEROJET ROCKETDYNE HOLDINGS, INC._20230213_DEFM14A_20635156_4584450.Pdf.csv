Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
The Special Meeting of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held online at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2023SM, on March 16, 2023, at 9:00 A.M. Pacific time.
Purposes of the Special Meeting
At the Special Meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following
proposals:
•
to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 17, 2022 (as amended,
modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company,
L3Harris and Merger Sub (the “Merger Proposal”);
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable
to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, the value of which is disclosed
in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” (the “Compensation
Proposal”); and
•
to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger
Proposal or in the absence of a quorum (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. If our
stockholders fail to approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. For more information, see the sections of
this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting” and “The Merger Agreement.”
No matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special Meeting.
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors (the “Board”) has approved, adopted and declared advisable the
Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and determined that the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders. The Board has
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s stockholders for their consideration at the
Special Meeting and recommends that the Company’s stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal and “FOR”
the other proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
The holders of record of outstanding shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock, as of the close of business
on February 9, 2023, the record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 80,677,246 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
 
2TABLE OF CONTENTS
The presence at the Special Meeting, virtually or represented by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the
voting power of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of Aerojet Rocketdyne will constitute a quorum at the
Special Meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the
Special Meeting, we expect that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to a later date.
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either virtually or by proxy, but abstains from
voting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If your
shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to
vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf as to any of the proposals, and
your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of
business at the Special Meeting.
Required Vote
Each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote
on each of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting.
For the Company to complete the Merger, a majority of the outstanding shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock must vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, assuming a quorum is present. An abstention as to the Merger
Proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
Approval of each of (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and that vote thereon, but is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. An abstention as to either proposal or a
failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker,
bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum
is present.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, approximately 731,905 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that
they intend to vote all of their shares of Common Stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation
Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Voting; Proxies; Revocation
To ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide
voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.
Shares of Common Stock Held in the Stock Fund of the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan
If you are a participant in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan, the enclosed proxy card will also
serve to provide voting instructions to by Fidelity Management Trust Company, the trustee of the Aerojet
Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan (the “Trustee”), with respect to any shares of the Stock Fund attributable to
your account under the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan. You may provide such instructions to the
Trustee by following the instructions on the proxy card. If you provide voting instructions by mail, telephone, or the
Internet, the Trustee will vote your shares as you have directed (or not vote your shares, if that is your direction). If
you do not provide voting instructions, the Trustee will vote your shares in the same proportion as shares for which
the Trustee has received voting instructions. You must submit voting instructions to the Trustee by no later than
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 13, 2023, in order for your shares to be voted as you have directed by the Trustee at
the Special Meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan participants may not vote their Plan shares
virtually at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods
described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with
instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the
Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of Common Stock will
be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as
described below.
Submit a Proxy Card by Mail. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is
received in time for the Special Meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the manner directed by you
on your proxy card. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy
will be voted in favor of each of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If
you fail to return your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, and you are a holder of record on the
record date, unless you attend the Special Meeting virtually and vote electronically, your shares of Common Stock
will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
Special Meeting, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and, assuming a quorum
is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,”
your broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your
shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by
telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.
In accordance with applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of
Common Stock in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares as to (i)
the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal or (iii) the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks
or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they cannot
vote such shares as to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the Special Meeting virtually with a properly
executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee will result in your shares of Common Stock not being present at the meeting and not being
voted on any of the proposals. As a result, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but it will have no effect on the other proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
If you choose to vote by telephone or by Internet, you do not have to return your proxy card or voting
instruction card. However, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Internet, we recommend that you
vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting via the
Internet.
Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy under this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it before it is voted. If
you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting by:
•
submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures
described above at any time up to 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023, or by completing, signing,
dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;
•
attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting electronically; or
•
delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at our
headquarters, 222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without taking
one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your
proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you
should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be
received by the Company before the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the
instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new
voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting
electronically at the Special Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other
nominee in order to be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.",9,12

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub
will merge with and into Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Aerojet Rocketdyne will continue as the surviving corporation and
as a wholly owned subsidiary of L3Harris (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, Aerojet
Rocketdyne will cease to be a publicly traded company and all outstanding shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, subject to applicable withholding taxes, (A) $58.00 per
share in cash, plus (B) if the closing date occurs after September 17, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (i) $0.0025
multiplied by (ii) the number of calendar days elapsed after September 17, 2023 to and including the closing date (the
“Additional Consideration” and, together with the $58.00 per share in cash, the “Price Per Share” or “Merger
Consideration”) except for (i) any shares held by Aerojet Rocketdyne or any wholly owned subsidiary of Aerojet
Rocketdyne (or held in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s treasury), including shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance
under any of our equity and performance incentive plans or Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Amended and Restated 2013
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), but not including any shares of Common Stock held by any of our
employee and performance incentive plans or trusts related thereto, (ii) any shares held, directly or indirectly, by
L3Harris or Merger Sub, and (iii) any shares owned by stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise
appraisal rights under the DGCL. You will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation upon
the consummation of the Merger.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no
longer have any rights as a stockholder of Aerojet Rocketdyne (except that stockholders who properly exercise their
appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined under an
appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described below in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Appraisal Rights”).
The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly after the Effective Time of the Merger, a designated paying
agent will send each holder of record of a certificate representing shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock or of
uncertificated shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock immediately before the Effective Time of the Merger a
customary letter of transmittal and instructions advising such holder as to how to surrender or transfer such shares
of Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The paying agent will promptly pay such holders the
Merger Consideration upon (i) the surrender of a certificate representing shares of Common Stock to the paying
agent (or compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the paying agent for transfer of uncertificated
shares) and (ii) delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by
the paying agent or L3Harris. Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of cash payments. The amount of any cash
payments paid to you will be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
You should not surrender your shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock without a letter of transmittal.

Merger.”

At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Aerojet Rocketdyne restricted Common Stock award
(“Restricted Stock Award”) will automatically (i) vest and be canceled and (ii) be converted into the right to receive
(subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share
5TABLE OF CONTENTS
multiplied by the total number of shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award, together with any accrued and
unpaid dividends corresponding to such Restricted Stock Award. The total number of shares subject to a
performance-based Restricted Stock Award will be based on deemed achievement of maximum performance.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock appreciation right (“SAR”) with respect to shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive (subject to any applicable
withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock subject to such SAR multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Price Per Share over the per share base
price of such SAR. Each outstanding SAR with respect to which the per share base price equals or exceeds the Price
Per Share will be canceled for no consideration at the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Aerojet Rocketdyne restricted stock unit award (“RSU
Award”) granted before the execution of the Merger Agreement will automatically (i) vest and be canceled and (ii) be
converted into the right to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of
the Price Per Share multiplied by the total number of shares subject to such vested RSU Award, together with any
accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested RSU Award. The total number of shares subject to a
performance-based RSU Award will be based on deemed achievement of maximum performance.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested RSU Award granted on or after the date of the execution of
the Merger Agreement (each, a “Post-Signing RSU Award”), excluding any such award granted to a non-employee
director, will be canceled. With respect to each canceled Post-Signing RSU Award:
•
for each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who remains employed with L3Harris or its subsidiaries as
of the L3Harris RSU Award grant date (which grant date will be within 30 days of the closing date), L3Harris
will grant an award of L3Harris restricted stock units (each such replacement award, a “L3Harris RSU
Award”) with respect to a number of shares of L3Harris common stock, rounded up to the nearest whole
number equal to the product of the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock subject to
such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), where (x) such L3Harris RSU Award will vest
•
on the same vesting schedule as the canceled Post-Signing RSU Award, based on continued
service following the Effective Time through each applicable vesting date, and
•
upon an earlier termination of employment or service by L3Harris or its affiliates without cause or,
solely with respect to any member of the Executive Leadership Team, an earlier resignation for
good reason, and
(y)
such L3Harris RSU Award will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Post-Signing RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or
•
for each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who is employed by Aerojet Rocketdyne as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who does not remain employed with L3Harris and its subsidiaries as of the
L3Harris RSU Award grant date, such former holder will be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable
withholdings), an amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the total number
of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock subject to such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award,
together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such Post-Signing RSU Award.
The “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means, with respect to each Post-Signing RSU, the quotient determined by
dividing (a) the Price Per Share by (b) the volume weighted average of the closing sale prices per share of the
L3Harris common stock on the NYSE, as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal (or, if not

Aerojet Rocketdyne retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citi”) to provide financial advisory services in
connection with a possible transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. In connection with Citi’s engagement, Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s board of directors requested that Citi evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of the consideration of $58.00 per share to be received in the
proposed Merger by such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement. On December 17, 2022, at a meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the
proposed Merger, Citi rendered to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Citi’s written
opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as set forth in its written opinion, the consideration of
$58.00 per share was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock.
The full text of Citi’s written opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors,
which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations
and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi’s opinion in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” beginning on page 39 is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Citi’s opinion. Citi’s opinion was rendered to the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger and
was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of the consideration of $58.00 per share. Citi’s opinion did not address any
other terms, aspects or implications of the proposed Merger or the Merger Agreement. Citi’s opinion did not

Aerojet Rocketdyne retained Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to provide financial advisory services in
connection with a possible transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. As part of this engagement, Aerojet
Rocketdyne requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration of
$58.00 per share to be received by the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock. On December 17, 2022, at a
meeting of the Board held to evaluate the proposed Merger, Evercore rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which
was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the consideration of $58.00
per share to be received by holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated December 17, 2022, which sets forth, among other
things, the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is
incorporated herein by reference. Aerojet Rocketdyne encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its
entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Board (in its

determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. The appraisal amount could be more than,
the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger
Agreement. To exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, stockholders must submit a written demand for appraisal
to Aerojet Rocketdyne prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, must not vote
in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and must continue to hold the shares of
Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of record through the Effective Time. Failure to comply strictly with the

From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger
Agreement, Aerojet Rocketdyne will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
or providing access to non-public information) the making or submission of, any indication of interest, proposal or
offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish (or continue to furnish) any nonpublic
information to any other person (other than L3Harris, Merger Sub and their respective representatives) that has made
or, to the knowledge of Aerojet Rocketdyne, is considering making an Alternative Proposal (except, in each case,
solely to clarify the terms and conditions of any proposal or offer made by any Person solely to determine whether
such proposal or offer constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal), or (iii) enter into
any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any other agreement relating to, or that is intended to or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under
the Merger Agreement).
However, at any time from the date of the Merger Agreement and before the time the Required Company
Stockholder Vote is obtained, if the Company receives a bona fide, written unsolicited Alternative Proposal that the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, Aerojet Rocketdyne may, in response to such Alternative
Proposal (x) furnish nonpublic information to such persons and their representatives and potential financing sources,
if, and only if, the third party has first executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions as to
confidential treatment of information and other terms that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than the confidentiality provisions and other terms of the confidentiality agreement between L3Harris and
the Company (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar
provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal on a confidential basis, but
such confidentiality agreement will not prohibit the Company or its subsidiaries from

such determination.",17,18

The Board has recommended that Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. The
Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the exceptions noted below, the Board may not:

withhold or withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to L3Harris or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to
withhold or withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to L3Harris or Merger Sub), the Board
Recommendation;
•
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable,
any Alternative Proposal;
•
fail to include the Board Recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
fail to publish, send or provide to the holders of shares of Common Stock, under Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, a statement recommending against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange
offer and publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten (10) business days after the commencement
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or fail to
maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such offer has expired or been
withdrawn; or
•
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Any action referred to in the clauses above is a “Change of Recommendation.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the
Merger Agreement permits the Board to, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited Alternative Proposal received
by the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement, make a Change of Recommendation or cause the Company
to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal, subject to the requirements that:
•
the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of the Merger Agreement that have been irrevocably offered by L3Harris in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
the Company provides prior written notice to L3Harris, at least three business days in advance, that it
intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal, which notice specifies the identity of the person making such proposal and a summary
of the material terms thereof and includes a copy of the proposed Superior Proposal and the proposed
acquisition agreement, if any, with respect thereto;
•
during the three business day period following the date on which notice was received (or the two business
day extension, in the event of any change to (i) the financial terms or (ii) other material terms of such
Superior Proposal), the Company and its representatives negotiate with L3Harris in good faith to consider
amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as L3Harris may propose;
•
upon the conclusion of the three business day period, the Board consider in good faith any revisions to
the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by L3Harris and determine, after consultation with
the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and
•
provided that in the event of any modification of the financial terms or any other material modifications to
the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company delivers a new written notice to L3Harris and again
complies with the requirements of such notice, except that the notice period in such instance will only be
two business days.

In addition, the Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation (before obtaining the Required Company
Stockholder Vote) in response to an Intervening Event if the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably
likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to a two business day negotiation period
with L3Harris.
An “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development first occurring or arising after the
date of the Merger Agreement that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that (i) is
unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the material
consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) does not involve or relate to an Alternative Proposal.

subject to certain extensions and limitations, (ii) Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders fail to approve the Merger
Proposal, (iii) a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued a final non-appealable governmental
order prohibiting the Merger (the “Legal Restraint Right”) and (iv) the other party breaches its representations,
warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement which causes the failure of a closing condition, subject in certain
cases to the right of the breaching party to cure the breach. L3Harris and the Company may also terminate the Merger
Agreement by mutual written consent. The Company may also terminate the Merger Agreement before obtaining the
Required Company Stockholder Vote in order to enter into an acquisition agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal, subject to compliance by the Company with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement.
L3Harris may also terminate the Merger Agreement if the Board has made a Change of Recommendation.

agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes an Alternative Proposal (which transaction is
subsequently consummated, whether during or following such twelve-month period) or (yy) the
Company completes a transaction that constitutes an Alternative Proposal.
(For purposes of the above, all references in the definition of “Alternative Proposal” to twenty percent (20%) are
fifty percent (50%) and the word “inquiry” will be disregarded. In no event will the Company be required to pay a
termination fee on more than one occasion.)

14TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
The presence, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled
to be cast on any matter to be acted on at the Special Meeting is necessary to have a quorum. If a quorum is not
present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a
quorum is obtained.
As of the close of business on February 9, 2023, the record date for the Special Meeting, there were 80,677,246
shares of Common Stock outstanding.
If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the
proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the
Special Meeting.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the
nominee how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf as to any of
the proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for
the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What vote of Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?
A:
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement.
An abstention as to the Merger Proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure
to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
Q:
What vote of Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at
the Special Meeting?
A:
Each of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and that vote
thereon.
An abstention as to either proposal or a failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of
Common Stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf),
will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board recommends that Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders vote:
•
“FOR” the Merger Proposal;
•
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and
•
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend in favor of the approval
of the Merger Proposal, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Aerojet Rocketdyne Board.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the
Board as to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have
interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders
generally. For a discussion of these interests, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger -
Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:
How many shares of Common Stock may Aerojet Rocketdyne’s directors and officers vote?
A:
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
approximately 731,905 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares of
 
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us
that they intend to vote all of their shares of Common Stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (2) “FOR” the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
Yes. If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and who properly
demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section
262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to have their shares appraised
by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Common
Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together
with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court.
Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the
relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger in 2023. However, completion of the
Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the
expiration of the required regulatory waiting period under the HSR Act and the approval of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s stockholders, which are described in this proxy statement, and we cannot be certain when or if the
conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for
any other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock in
connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of Common Stock
will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the NYSE. In the event
that either Aerojet Rocketdyne or L3Harris terminates the Merger Agreement, then, in certain specified
circumstances, Aerojet Rocketdyne may be required to pay L3Harris the Company Termination Fee, or L3Harris
may be required to pay Aerojet Rocketdyne the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable. For more information, see
the sections of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee” and “The
Merger Agreement - Parent Termination Fee.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the Compensation Proposal? What will happen if
stockholders do not approve this proposal?
A:
The inclusion of the Compensation Proposal is required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”); however, the approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the
Merger and the vote on the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not be binding
on the Company or L3Harris. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company’s stockholders and the
Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company’s named executive officers
in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the Company’s
stockholders fail to approve this Compensation Proposal.
Q:
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of shares of Common Stock?
A:
The merger consideration of $58.00 per share represents a 37% premium to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s closing stock
price on August 15, 2022 (the last full day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Common Stock).
Q:
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?
A:
We urge you to read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is important,
regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock you own.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Voting at the Special Meeting
Stockholders of record will be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of
record but instead hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee,
you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be
able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.
It is not necessary to attend the Special Meeting virtually in order to vote your shares of Common Stock. To
ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide
voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.
Attending the Special Meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
You can ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting by submitting your proxy
via:
•
mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope;
•
telephone, by using the toll-free number 1-800-690-6903; or
•
the Internet before the meeting date, at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2023SM.
The telephone and Internet voting before the meeting date facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59
P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted
“FOR” (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.
We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the Special Meeting virtually.
A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the Merger
Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the
directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in 401(k) Plan Account
If you hold shares in a Aerojet Rocketdyne 401(k) plan account, you should follow the directions provided by
the plan administrator or plan trustee regarding how to instruct the plan trustee how to vote your shares.
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of
record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company in writing, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at
our headquarters, 222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245, or by submitting a new
proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above at any
time up to 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new
proxy card by mail to the Company. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the Special Meeting;
however, simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you
want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a written notice of
revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of
revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you hold your shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke
your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by
voting electronically at the Special Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker,
bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
A:
The requisite number of shares to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding on February 9, 2023, the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do
not vote, or abstain from voting, on the Merger Proposal, or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to
give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares of
Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and that vote thereon. If you
abstain from voting on (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal or if you do not return
your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker, bank
or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), it will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a
quorum is present.
Q:
Will my shares of Common Stock held in “street name” or held in another form of record ownership be
combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares of Common Stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a
different stockholder (that is, your broker, bank, or other nominee) than any shares of Common Stock you hold
of record, any shares of Common Stock held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with
shares of Common Stock held of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Common Stock in various registered
forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and
will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Common Stock because they are held in a
different form of record ownership. Shares of Common Stock held by a corporation or business entity must be
voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the
proxy card.
Q:
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
A:
If your shares of Common Stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive
more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting
instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of
your shares of Common Stock are voted.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger?
A:
In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Common Stock through completion
of the Merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger, you
will have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the completion of the
Merger. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock after the record date but before the closing of the Merger,
you will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Q:
If the Merger is completed, how do I obtain the Merger Consideration for my shares of Common Stock?
A:
Following the completion of the Merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into the
right to receive your portion of the Merger Consideration. After the Merger is completed, if your shares of
Common Stock are evidenced by stock certificates, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials
from the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common
Stock evidenced by stock certificates for the Merger Consideration (without interest and subject
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to any required tax withholding). If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank
or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if
any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (without interest and subject to any required tax withholding).
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of Common
Stock with the proxy card. If the Merger is completed and if your shares of Common Stock are evidenced by
stock certificates, the paying agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and
instructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (without interest and
subject to any required tax withholding).
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance
notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of
the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of
Common Stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Common Stock, you
may have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if
you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery
of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any
time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
Q:
Where can I find more information about Aerojet Rocketdyne?
A:
You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the costs of soliciting proxies?
A:
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. This includes the charges and
expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of our
outstanding Common Stock. Aerojet Rocketdyne has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. (“D.F. King”), a proxy
solicitation firm, to assist the Board in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting, and we expect to pay
D.F. King approximately $20,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses.
Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, email, telephone, or via the Internet by D.F. King or, without
additional compensation, by certain of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s directors, officers and employees.
Q:
Who can help answer my other questions?
A:
If you have more questions about the Merger or any of the other matters set forth in this proxy statement, or
require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this document or
the enclosed proxy card, please contact D.F. King, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent and
information agent for Aerojet Rocketdyne in connection with the Special Meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholders can contact D.F. King by email at AJRD@dfking.com or by calling toll-free at (888) 886-4425, banks
and brokers can call collect at (212) 269-5550.

This proxy statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to
be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.
Stockholders can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “estimate,” “may,” “will,”
“could,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “continue” or the negative of such terms, or other similar
expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future
events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
Actual results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Among other risks and uncertainties, there can be no guarantee that the Merger will be completed, or if it
is completed, that it will close within the anticipated time frame. Additional risks and uncertainties relating to the
acquisition include: (1) the Company may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the transaction;
(2) other conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied or waived; (3) the transaction may involve
unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; (4) the Company’s business may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding
the transaction, including due to disruption of current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee
retention as a result of the transaction; (5) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the transaction; (6)
required regulatory approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all; and (7) an event, change or other
circumstances may occur that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement. Important risk factors that
could cause actual results or outcomes to differ from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are described
in the “Risk Factors” section in Item 1A of our Annual Report to the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2021, and Part II, Item 1A of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and no
obligation is assumed to update any forward-looking statements, even if expectations change, except as required by
law. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued “forward-looking statement”
constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at investors’ own
risk.

At the Special Meeting, Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders will be asked to consider and approve the following
proposals:
•
the Merger Proposal;
•
the Compensation Proposal, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger - Quantification of Payments”; and
•
the Adjournment Proposal.
Our stockholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve
the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and certain provisions of the Merger
Agreement are described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and
vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Aerojet
Rocketdyne or L3Harris. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation
agreements and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholders.
No matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special Meeting.

constitute a quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting. Once a share is represented at the Special Meeting, it will
be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. However, if a new record

on each of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting.
For the Company to complete the Merger, Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders holding a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement must vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. An abstention as to the

Approval of each of (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting

as failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to instruct

Attendance
All holders of shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on February 9, 2023, the record date,
including stockholders of record and beneficial owners of Common Stock registered in the “street name” of a broker,
bank or other nominee, are invited to attend the Special Meeting virtually.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” and you also wish to be able to vote at the meeting, you must obtain a
legal proxy, executed in your favor, from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Voting at the Special Meeting
Shareholders of record will be able to virtually attend and vote electronically at the Special Meeting. If you are
not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name” through a broker, bank
or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in
order to be able to vote electronically at the Special Meeting. Attending the Special Meeting virtually does not itself
constitute a vote on any proposal.
Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide
voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.
Shares of Common Stock Held in the Stock Fund of the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan
If you are a participant in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan, the enclosed proxy card will also
serve to provide voting instructions to Fidelity Management Trust Company, the Trustee, with respect to any shares
of the Stock Fund attributable to your account under the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan. You may
provide such instructions to the Trustee by following the instructions on the proxy card. If you provide
23TABLE OF CONTENTS
voting instructions by mail, telephone, or the Internet, the Trustee will vote your shares as you have directed (or not
vote your shares, if that is your direction). If you do not provide voting instructions, the Trustee will vote your
shares in the same proportion as shares for which the Trustee has received voting instructions. You must submit
voting instructions to the Trustee by no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 13, 2023, in order for your shares
to be voted as you have directed by the Trustee at the Special Meeting. Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan
participants may not vote their Plan shares electronically at the Special Meeting.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods
described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with
instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the
Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of Common Stock will
be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as
described below.
Submit a Proxy Card by Mail. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is
received in time for the Special Meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the manner directed by you
on your proxy card.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted
in favor of each of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to
return your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, and you are a holder of record on the record date,
unless you attend the Special Meeting and vote electronically, your shares of Common Stock will not be considered
present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and, assuming a quorum is present, will
have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,”
your broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your
shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by
telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.
In accordance with applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of
Common Stock in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares as to (i)
the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal or (iii) the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks
or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they cannot
vote such shares as to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the Special Meeting virtually with a properly
executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee will result in your shares of Common Stock not being present at the meeting and not being
voted on any of the proposals. As a result, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but it will have no effect on the other proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy under this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it before it is voted. If
you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting by:
•
submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures
described above at any time up to 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on March 15, 2023, or by completing, signing,
dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;
•
attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting electronically; or

•
delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at our

"AEROJET ROCKETDYNE HOLDINGS, INC._20230213_DEFM14A_20635156_4584450.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and
plans, the Board and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management periodically review, consider, and assess Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s capabilities, operations, financial performance, business plans and prospects, as well as overall
industry conditions, opportunities and risks for the Company as they may affect those strategic goals and plans.
This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations,
acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, and other financial and strategic alternatives that might be in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders on an ongoing basis.
In December 2020, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Lockheed Martin, pursuant to which the
Company would merge with and into a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (the “Lockheed Martin transaction”) in
exchange for consideration of $51.00 per share in cash (exclusive of a $5.00 per share special one-time cash dividend
that was paid in March 2021). In all, the consideration contemplated by the Lockheed Martin transaction totaled
approximately $5 billion in equity value and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders voted to approve the transaction on
March 9, 2021. On January 21, 2022, the FTC unanimously voted to issue an administrative complaint to block the
transaction, which was filed on January 25, 2022, and on February 13, 2022, Lockheed Martin delivered notice of
termination of the merger agreement resulting in abandonment of the Lockheed Martin transaction.
In the wake of the failure to consummate the Lockheed Martin transaction, disagreements arose within the
Board about various matters, including the future direction of the Company. As a result, a proxy fight ensued in
which competing slates engaged in a proxy contest from January to June 2022. One proposed Board slate was led by
the CEO of the Company and the other proposed Board slate was led by the former Executive Chairman of the
Company. During the proxy contest, the competing slates each engaged with Company stockholders in discussions
over the strategic direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On June 30, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “2022 Special Meeting”) at which the
current Board was elected (the slate led by the Company’s CEO).
27TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the proxy contest, the members of the prevailing Board slate (including the newly proposed nominees)
had received input from many Company stockholders indicating their preference that the Board consider all of the
Company’s potential strategic alternatives in order to determine a preferred path forward that was in the best interests
of the Company. The prevailing Board slate committed to do that.
To carry out that commitment, the newly elected Board held a meeting on August 1, 2022, shortly after the 2022
Special Meeting, to consider a report from members of the Company’s senior management on, among other things,
the state of the business, the Company’s financial performance, and its future outlook and prospects relative to
potential strategic alternatives. The meeting was held by videoconference and, unless otherwise noted, all Board
meetings were held by videoconference. At this initial meeting, presentations were made by members of the
Company’s senior management on the Company’s standalone plan (the “strategic plan”). The presentations also
covered the environment for mergers and acquisitions and the potential benefit to the Company of pursuing either an
acquisition or a business combination with another aerospace and defense company. The presentations addressed
the comparative potential for the Company to grow and become more profitable through either acquiring other
complementary assets or companies, executing its existing standalone strategic plan, or combining with a larger
strategic or financial acquiror. As to the last option, the Board was informed of unsolicited expressions of interest
that members of the Company’s senior management and the Company’s financial advisors had received from several
industry participants after the termination of the Lockheed Martin transaction. As a result of the discussion, the
Board directed members of the Company’s senior management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, to
prepare a more detailed analysis of the full set of potential strategic alternatives available.
The next day, on August 2, 2022, consistent with the Board’s direction that the Company’s senior management
consider the Company’s strategic alternatives and develop options for consideration by the Board, a meeting was
held in person between the Board’s non-executive chair, Thomas A. Corcoran, and the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer, Eileen P. Drake, along with members of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s senior management and the Company’s financial
advisors, Citi and Evercore, which had both served as the Company’s financial advisors for the Lockheed Martin
transaction, and its legal advisor, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”). Members of the Company’s
senior management presented, among other things, an overview of the Company’s performance and an update on
trends in the aerospace and defense industry, and each of Citi and Evercore presented a review of potential strategic
and financial buyers for Aerojet Rocketdyne if the Company were to pursue a sale or a business combination. During
the presentation, members of the Company’s senior management discussed the unsolicited expressions of interest
that the Company had received in the wake of the termination of the Lockheed Martin transaction and the 2022
Special Meeting from a number of third parties interested in a possible strategic transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne.
An important aspect of the discussion of the Company’s strategic alternatives focused on the utility in the industries
in which the Company competed of having the resources to make desired capital expenditures and research and
development investments. The discussion noted the difficulty for the Company to obtain the scale in its business
lines that the Company desired through acquisitions, given that most of the potential acquisitions within the
Company’s financial capacity would not help attain such scale, as compared to transactions in which a strategic
counterparty of comparable or much greater size might combine with or acquire the Company. A review of potential
strategic and financial counterparties was conducted, and the importance of ensuring a competitive process that
involved viable strategic and financial counterparties who could consummate a potential transaction was discussed.
The merger and acquisition alternatives in light of the Company’s strategic plan and standalone prospects were
also considered and discussed. In view of the failure of the Lockheed Martin transaction to secure regulatory
clearance, the need for any potential transaction to, among other things, address regulatory risk and for the terms of
any transaction to provide the Company with appropriate transactional certainty and protections in light of such risk
was also discussed. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Corcoran and Ms. Drake agreed that the Board should be
presented at its next meeting with potential strategic alternatives and an assessment of its capital allocation options,
including the possibility of proceeding with a full process to consider a potential combination of the Company with a
strategic or financial counterparty, which could take the form of, among other things, a potential sale of the Company
(the “strategic process”) and that the Company should work with its outside financial and legal advisors to prepare
the presentation materials and an illustrative timeline for the Board to review, discuss and consider.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 15, 2022, before the proposed meeting with the Board was scheduled to be held, Bloomberg News
released an article stating that Elliott Management (“Elliott”) had acquired a 3.7% equity stake in the Company. In the
same period, representatives of Elliott reached out to Ms. Drake and sought a meeting with her. In a telephonic
discussion with representatives of Elliott, the Elliott representatives expressed, among other things, potential interest
in pursuing a potential transaction involving the Company.
In response to these developments, a meeting of the Board was convened on the same day for members of the
Company’s senior management, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore to brief the Board on the potential impact Elliott’s
investment and stated intentions could have on the Company. During this discussion, the importance of ensuring a
competitive process that involved viable strategic and financial counterparties who could consummate a potential
transaction was emphasized again in the event that the Board ultimately determined to pursue a strategic process
after further informing itself regarding the Company’s strategic alternatives at the upcoming Board meeting. The
closing price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Common Stock on August 15, 2022, the last trading day before
Elliott’s position in the Company was released, was $42.49.
On August 18, 2022, members of the Company’s senior management, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore met with
Mr. Corcoran in his role as non-executive chair to discuss, among other things, potential strategic alternatives for the
Company, which included a further refined set of materials regarding a potential strategic process, including the range
of potential counterparties, the trends for mergers and acquisitions in the defense and aerospace industry, the
Company’s valuation compared to the Company’s standalone strategic plan and the degree of regulatory risk
associated with each potential counterparty. After discussion, Mr. Corcoran expressed his desire that the advisors
join members of the Company’s senior management to make the presentation to the Board on August 30. At this
meeting, Mr. Corcoran raised the fact that he was on the board of L3Harris but had recused himself from any
discussion on the L3Harris board regarding the Company.
On August 23, 2022, a press report on Dealreporter indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne was in discussions with a
few potential strategic buyers about a potential transaction. Aerojet Rocketdyne declined to comment on the report.
On August 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting, which was also attended by members of the Company’s senior
management, Wachtell Lipton and, for a portion of the meeting, Citi and Evercore. During the meeting, the Board
addressed certain issues relevant to the conduct of the strategic process if one was to be undertaken. These issues
included, among other things, reviewing and approving, with input from Wachtell Lipton and without Citi or Evercore
present, the terms for updated engagement letters for each of Citi and Evercore as the Company’s financial advisors.
Citi and Evercore had served as the Company’s financial advisors for the Lockheed Martin transaction. The Board
discussed that Citi and Evercore had certain relationships with certain of the potential counterparties, but did not
believe that it would have an impact on either firm with respect to their work for the Company.
In advance of the meeting, Citi and Evercore presented the Board with information about potential
counterparties for acquisition by the Company and potential counterparties that could potentially be interested in
and capable of acquiring the Company. As to the latter category, the set of potential counterparties included 13
strategic defense and aerospace companies and nine financial sponsors. One of the potential counterparties was
L3Harris. The list was later updated to add one additional potential strategic counterparty and then re-delivered to
the Board on August 31, 2022.
Consistent with the Board’s request at the August 1, 2022 meeting, the Board considered at length its strategic
options, with input from members of the Company’s senior management, Citi, Evercore and Wachtell Lipton. As part
of this consideration, Mr. Corcoran summarized three of the Company’s potential strategic options: (1) execute the
Company’s standalone strategic plan and defer consideration of mergers and acquisitions opportunities in the near
term, (2) consider acquisitions by the Company in order to obtain greater scale and other changes in its capital
allocation; or (3) undertake the strategic process, through which the Company would engage with potential strategic
and financial counterparties to explore the opportunity for a business combination, including a potential sale of the
Company, to deliver value for Company stockholders and to provide the Company’s business lines with greater scale
and the capacity for growth and investment.
With input from members of the Company’s senior management and financial and legal advisors, the Board
reviewed each of the three options Mr. Corcoran had outlined. The discussion of the potential utility for a strategic
merger and acquisition process was accompanied by and came in the context of a review of the
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company’s current strategic plan. To aid that discussion and consideration of the comparative advisability of the
Company’s options, members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of each of Citi and Evercore
provided the Board certain preliminary financial analyses of Aerojet Rocketdyne on a standalone basis. Members of
the Company’s senior management and Citi and Evercore each also discussed the aerospace and defense industry
generally and trends in mergers and acquisitions transactions in the aerospace and defense industry and reviewed
the advantages and risks presented by potential candidates for acquisition by the Company and of the potential
financial and strategic counterparties who might be interested in and capable of successfully combining with or
acquiring the Company. The potential implications of regulatory risk, and in particular, investigations of or challenges
to a potential transaction by antitrust regulators, was also the subject of the discussion in this context. The utility of
focusing on potential counterparties who did not pose regulatory issues similar to those in the abandoned Lockheed
Martin transaction was discussed, as was the importance of ensuring that the form of any transaction agreement
provide the Company with as much certainty and protection to address regulatory risk as was achievable. The Board
received information on, among other things, the types of provisions used to accomplish that end.
The Board was also provided with a potential framework and schedule for conducting a strategic process
involving outreach to potential strategic and financial buyers, with a recommendation from each of the Company’s
senior management, Citi and Evercore as to which should be the subject of outreach in light of their viability to be
counterparties in a transaction in the best interests of the Company.
Throughout the course of the meeting, the Board weighed the potential benefits of outreach to counterparties
against the potential risks of such a process, including the risks to employee retention and destabilization in the
event of a leak, and further considered the set of potential counterparties identified in the Board materials. At the end
of the meeting, the Company’s senior management recommended that the Company conduct the strategic process on
the suggested timeline, begin outreach to potential counterparties, and to further explore a business combination that
could provide necessary scale and resources for the Company’s defense and space businesses to effectively
compete, while continuing to manage the Company in accordance with its strategic plan. Members of the Company’s
senior management explained that, although the Company’s standalone strategic plan was sound, its execution
depended on accessing a substantial amount of capital and deploying it towards the acceleration of capital
expenditures and investments in research and development. Members of the Company’s senior management also
emphasized that there were limited acquisition opportunities available that would increase the Company’s scale. It
was noted that substantial interest had been expressed by potential counterparties with the capital to invest in the
Company’s business lines and to engage in a transaction that would deliver value for the Company’s stockholders.
Senior management explained its view that proceeding with the strategic process was the Company’s best path
forward. Mr. Corcoran concurred with the recommendation from members of the Company’s senior management and
the Board unanimously approved proceeding with the strategic process. Following further discussion, it was the
Board’s view that the strategic process should focus on potential financial and strategic counterparties who might be
capable of successfully combining with or acquiring the Company without presenting heightened regulatory risk.
On September 1 and September 6, 2022, Ms. Drake spoke with L3Harris’s CEO, Christopher E. Kubasik,
regarding, among other things, L3Harris’s potential interest in participating in a strategic process.
In accordance with the Board’s direction, during the period between September 5, 2022 and October 14, 2022,
representatives of Citi and Evercore made initial contact with 17 potential transaction counterparties - 10 strategic
counterparties, including L3Harris, and seven financial sponsor counterparties - to gauge their interest in a potential
strategic transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne. Of those 17 counterparties, eight strategic counterparties, including
L3Harris, and six financial sponsor counterparties entered into a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with Aerojet
Rocketdyne to begin conducting due diligence on the Company. Pursuant to the terms of these non-disclosure
agreements, all standstill restrictions expired upon the announcement of a transaction or tender or exchange offer for
50% or more of the Company’s securities or assets, in each case solely to permit the counterparties to make an
expression of interest to submit a Superior Proposal. Three of the 17 parties contacted by representatives of Citi and
Evercore chose not to engage in discussions with Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On September 23, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of the Company’s senior management of
Aerojet Rocketdyne, Wachtell Lipton and, for a portion of the meeting, Citi and Evercore, were also present. At the
meeting, members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Citi and Evercore
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
provided an update of certain interactions and discussions held with the parties contacted in connection with
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s strategic process and discussion ensued with respect to the status of the strategic process.
Representatives of Citi and Evercore also reviewed the 14 counterparties contacted by representatives of Citi and
Evercore that chose to proceed in the strategic process and conduct due diligence. Members of the Company’s
senior management reiterated to the Board the importance of confidentiality, of limiting outside contact by Board
members with any of the potential counterparties and of treating all parties equally given the competitive and
sensitive nature of the process. In the materials for the meeting, the Board had been provided informational materials
on certain actions the Company could take with respect to Elliott’s recently disclosed position in order to permit the
exploration of the strategic process without the effect of a significant position by Elliott in the Company’s Common
Stock.
Based upon advice from Wachtell Lipton, the Board also considered the fact that Mr. Corcoran was a director of
L3Harris and that another director (“Director AA”) was a director of another company in the industry that was
discussed as a potential counterparty and had executed a non-disclosure agreement as part of the strategic process.
Wachtell Lipton informed the Board that, although overlapping service by certain directors on the board of a
potential counterparty could pose conflict issues that should be accounted for in the future, the strategic process
had not yet begun and there were no concerns with Mr. Corcoran and Director AA participating fully in preliminary
discussions regarding whether to pursue a strategic process. Wachtell Lipton noted, however, that, should the
strategic process proceed to a point at which specific offers from counterparties were received and the number of
parties were narrowed, recusals and other actions to minimize the potential for any conflict of interest might become
appropriate. Later in September, Director AA informed the Company that the other company for which they also
served as a director had requested that they recuse themselves entirely from the discussions regarding any strategic
process on the boards of both companies. Consistent with such advice, Director AA did not participate in
discussions regarding the strategic process in Board meetings. During the meeting, the Board also reviewed the
marketing materials and confidential information presentation that the Company planned to distribute to the 14
potential counterparties that had executed a non-disclosure agreement in order to help them proceed with their due
diligence investigations and submit an initial indication of interest and accompanying price range for a transaction
with the Company (the “initial indications of interest”).
Beginning on September 27, 2022, representatives of Citi and Evercore sent a process email to each of the 14
potential counterparties that had entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Aerojet Rocketdyne, requesting initial
indications of interest by October 14, 2022.
On September 29, 2022, Ms. Drake and Mr. Kubasik spoke by telephone regarding the recusal of Mr. Corcoran
from discussions about the strategic process relating specifically to L3Harris on the boards of both L3Harris and
Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On October 3, 2022, upon the announcement of L3Harris’s acquisition of Viasat, Inc.’s Tactical Data Links
product line, the Company was informed that Citi had represented L3Harris in the transaction. When Citi’s
relationship with L3Harris was considered by the Board at its August 30, 2022 meeting, the Board did not view Citi’s
work for L3Harris as bearing on the strategic process that the Board was considering or that it would otherwise pose
a material issue for Citi with respect to their work for the Company.
On October 14, 2022, seven potential counterparties - five potential strategic counterparties, including L3Harris,
and two potential financial sponsor counterparties - submitted initial indications of interest to acquire Aerojet
Rocketdyne (such parties, other than L3Harris, referred to as “Bidder A,” “Bidder B,” “Bidder C,” “Bidder D,” “Bidder
E” and “Bidder F”). Bidder E was formed after two of the financial sponsors targeted in the initial outreach requested
to form a single co-bidding group and the request was granted by the Company’s management, following
consultation with the Company’s financial and legal advisors. Bidder A indicated a price range of $52.00 - $55.00 per
share; Bidder B indicated a price of $51.00 per share; Bidder C indicated a price range of $47.00 - $52.00 per share;
Bidder D declined to provide a written indication of value, noting that further diligence would be required; and
Bidders E and F each indicated a price range of $50.00 - $52.00 per share. Despite having expressed substantial
interest in a potential transaction with the Company, L3Harris initially indicated a price range of $47.00 - $49.00.
Because L3Harris’s initial price range was low compared with those of other bidders, despite its perceived strategic fit
with the Company and its financial capacity to conduct a transaction on terms favorable to the Company, members of
the Company’s senior management and its financial and legal advisors determined it was advisable to inform L3Harris
that its initial price range was not
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
competitive and that it risked exclusion from the strategic process. Mr. Corcoran was not involved in that decision or
in any discussion regarding that decision. After the financial advisors of the Company so informed L3Harris, on
October 15, 2022, L3Harris responded with an increased price range of $50.00 - $52.00 per share.
On October 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of the Company’s senior management of
Aerojet Rocketdyne, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were also present. Before the full Board meeting, an executive
session of the entire Board was held, with the presence of members of the Company’s senior management, and
without the presence of any of the Company’s outside advisors.
The purpose of the executive session was to again discuss, among other things, whether the directors wished to
proceed with the ongoing strategic process that involved consideration of whether the Company might enter into a
strategic transaction with another company, or should instead concentrate all its resources at this time on executing
the Company’s standalone strategic plan. In advance of the executive session, the Board had been provided with and
had reviewed input from members of the Company’s senior management and outside advisors, which provided the
Board with, among other things, updated information about the Company’s latest standalone strategic plan, its stock
price, the market conditions facing the Company and other relevant information, including a summary of the non-
binding indications of interest submitted by seven of the potential counterparties, which portion of such materials
had been redacted from the materials provided to Mr. Corcoran. Director AA recused themselves from the executive
session and did not receive the materials. After discussion, the Board was inclined, subject to receiving additional
input from members of the Company’s senior management and the Company’s outside advisors, to proceed with the
strategic process because it could yield a transaction that might be in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders.
At that time, the full Board meeting began and Wachtell Lipton summarized, among other things, the terms of the
draft merger agreement to be distributed to the subset of bidders selected to advance to the next round of the
strategic process, focusing in particular on provisions that would ensure a greater degree of closing certainty for the
Company. Consistent with the relevant counterparty’s request in late September and with the Company’s full assent,
Director AA recused themselves from the entirety of the full Board meeting and did not receive the materials.
At that time, Mr. Corcoran also recused himself from the meeting in light of his service on the L3Harris board of
directors. Because of Mr. Corcoran’s role as non-executive chair and because of the still-early stage of the strategic
process, Wachtell Lipton advised that Mr. Corcoran’s agreement to recuse as to any information or Board
deliberation relating specifically to L3Harris was sufficient for present purposes, but that more extensive recusal by
Mr. Corcoran might be required at a later time when it became necessary to consider specific offers from potential
counterparties, narrow the participants in the strategic process or to compare the utility of transactions with other
counterparties.
After Mr. Corcoran had recused himself, representatives of Citi and Evercore presented the non-binding
indications of interest submitted by seven of the potential counterparties - comparing the price ranges, early
regulatory feedback and financing plans for each. Representatives of Citi and Evercore presented preliminary
financial analyses of Aerojet Rocketdyne and it was noted that the price ranges offered by the bidders compared
favorably against the effective offer price of $51.00 per share in the Lockheed Martin transaction. Representatives of
Citi and Evercore also reviewed, among other things, a timeline of next steps and summarized each party’s
engagement with the diligence process to date. Members of the Company’s senior management recommended to the
Board that L3Harris and Bidders A, B, C, E and F be invited to participate in the next round of the strategic process,
which would begin with a scheduled management presentation and further diligence, followed by a request for
revised bids from each bidder (the “revised bids”). The Board determined to proceed as recommended. With review
of the individual bidders’ submissions complete and the discussion of next steps concluded, Mr. Corcoran returned
to the meeting and further discussion ensued about, among other things, the Company’s preparedness in relation to
the previously discussed position disclosed by Elliott.
In accordance with the Board’s directions, during the period between October 23, 2022 and November 3, 2022,
representatives of Citi and Evercore scheduled management presentations and further diligence processes, including
site visits where requested, with each of L3Harris and Bidders A, B, C, E and F. Executive leadership from each of the
bidders attended separate management presentations with senior management of Aerojet Rocketdyne either via
videoconference or in person at Aerojet Rocketdyne’s corporate headquarters in
32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
El Segundo, California. During the course of this process, additional diligence material was uploaded to the virtual
data room, which was made available to each bidder. Bidders were also given the opportunity to ask supplemental
diligence questions of the Company’s senior management regarding the diligence materials for the purpose of
informing the revised bids.
On October 25, 2022, a press report in Reuters indicated that Aerojet Rocketdyne was soliciting acquisition
offers from a number of potential bidders. Aerojet Rocketdyne declined to comment on the report. The closing price
per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock on October 24, 2022, the last trading day before the Reuters report
was issued, was $45.33.
On October 27, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting at which members of the Company’s senior
management were present, but Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were absent. The Board reviewed ordinary course
items for the Company’s business. A brief update on the strategic process was given. The Board discussed these
items with members of the Company’s senior management and the importance of confidentiality and an even hand
towards all potential counterparties was reiterated.
On November 4, 2022, representatives of Citi and Evercore sent a process letter by email to each of the six
potential counterparties that had submitted initial indications of interest and were continuing to pursue a potential
transaction, requesting a revised bid by December 8, 2022, and explaining that each bidder would receive a draft
merger agreement so that they could submit an interim markup by November 30, 2022 for a preliminary round of
feedback from the Company to inform each bidder’s submission of transaction documents on December 8, 2022
alongside the revised bid.
On November 14, 2022, representatives of Citi and Evercore distributed an initial draft of the Merger Agreement
to all six potential counterparties remaining in the strategic process, inviting counterparties, if they wished, to provide
an initial markup on November 30, to allow the opportunity for interaction about the merger agreement draft before
the December 8 deadline for revised bids.
On November 19, 2022, Bidder F notified Citi and Evercore that it would withdraw from the strategic process
after determining it would be unable to submit a competitive revised bid.
On November 21, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of senior management of Aerojet
Rocketdyne, Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were also present. Given the narrowing of the field of potential
counterparties, the fact that L3Harris was still an active potential counterparty and the need to consider potential
revised bids in relation to each other, it was determined that Mr. Corcoran should recuse himself from all Board
deliberations regarding the strategic process. For that reason, Mr. Corcoran recused himself from the entirety of the
meeting, as did Director AA.
At the meeting, the Board, with input from members of the Company’s senior management and financial
advisors, reviewed, among other things, an update on the strategic process and a revised view of the Company’s
standalone strategic plan, and determined that competitive pressures and other limitations, including the need for
greater scale and breadth of product diversity, continued to support the Company’s pursuit of a strategic transaction.
The Board also reviewed, among other things, the degree of engagement in the process by each of the remaining
bidders. Wachtell Lipton also summarized the key terms of the merger agreement draft that was distributed to all
bidders in advance of the deadline for the revised bids, noting in particular the importance of the proposed reverse
break fee, the “ticking” fee and efforts covenants requiring the buyer to secure regulatory clearance, as well as each
provision’s utility in ensuring more closing certainty and protection for the Company in the event a transaction did
not close. Wachtell Lipton also reviewed with the Board, among other things, the Board’s fiduciary duties in the
context of a potential transaction, noting that the Board was entitled to rely on the expertise of its advisors
throughout the process and in making any final decision. At the end of the meeting, the Board directed members of
the Company’s senior management and advisors to proceed with negotiations and diligence with each of the
remaining five counterparties in pursuit of transaction on terms in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders.
In accordance with the Board’s direction, during the period between November 21, 2022 and December 8, 2022,
members of Company’s senior management, Citi and Evercore continued to engage each of the bidders with diligence
calls and scheduled site visits for members of bidders’ business and advisor teams (for those bidders that requested
site visits).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 30, 2022, L3Harris, Bidder B and Bidder C each submitted initial markups of the merger agreement
to Wachtell Lipton for feedback in advance of the December 8, 2022 deadline for revised bids. Over the following
days, Wachtell Lipton reviewed the terms of each markup with members of the Company’s senior management and
the Company’s financial advisors and provided feedback to each of the bidders. Bidder A and Bidder E did not
submit markups of the merger agreement for feedback.
On December 3 and December 4, 2022, clean team agreements were entered into with each of L3Harris, Bidder A,
Bidder C and Bidder E to facilitate access to additional diligence materials in advance of the submission of revised
bids.
During the period from November 30, 2022 to December 8, 2022, Wachtell Lipton provided detailed feedback to
each of L3Harris, Bidder B and Bidder C on their markups of the transaction documents.
On December 6, 2022, in advance of L3Harris’s submission of a revised bid, Mr. Kubasik sent personal letters to
each member of the Board concerning his company’s interest in pursuing a transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne.
On December 8, 2022, Bidder B and Bidder C each submitted revised bids. Bidder B offered $51.00 per share and
did not submit a revised markup of the transaction documents beyond what it had already submitted on November
30, 2022. Bidder C offered $52.00 per share and submitted a further revised markup of the transaction documents.
Each bid was for all-cash consideration with no financing contingency. L3Harris had advised that it would provide its
revised bid on December 9 after concluding its board meeting on that date.
On December 9, 2022, L3Harris submitted a revised bid, along with revised transaction documents, and Bidder E
submitted only a revised price bid. L3Harris offered $57.00 per share and Bidder E offered $50.00 per share, each in all-
cash consideration with no financing contingency. The closing price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock
on December 9, 2022, was $53.89.
Bidder A did not submit a revised bid and indicated that it had ultimately decided it was interested only in
purchasing a part of, but not the entire Company. Citi and Evercore told Bidder A that the Company would welcome
its return to the strategic process if it reconsidered that decision.
On December 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which members of the Company’s senior management,
Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore were also present. Mr. Corcoran and Director AA recused themselves from the
entirety of the meeting. Without the financial advisors present, Wachtell Lipton reviewed again with the Board its
fiduciary duties in the context of the contemplated transaction and provided an updated overview of the regulatory
risk associated with each remaining bidder. With the presence of all advisors, the Board reviewed, among other
things, the status of the strategic process, including a comparison of the revised bids submitted by each bidder and a
comparison of the potential benefits of the revised bids in comparison to executing the Company’s standalone
strategic plan. Citi and Evercore also reported on their discussion with Bidder A. Copies of the personal notes sent to
members of the Board on December 6 by Mr. Kubasik were shared with the Board. The Board also reviewed a
comparison of the terms of the merger agreement submitted in each bidder’s markup of the transaction documents.
The Board also discussed the remaining timeline and was advised that continued public speculation and reporting
about the process made it prudent to bring the bidding process to a timely resolution while there was substantial
competitive pressure on the remaining bidders. Members of the Company’s senior management and financial
advisors advised the Board that the latest proposals from L3Harris and Bidder C reflected attractive valuations for the
Company relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s historical trading and standalone strategic plan. The Board was also
advised that even though both proposals were already favorable in terms of both price and contract provisions
relative to the merger agreement in the Lockheed Martin transaction, there was still the potential to further improve
them in the final stage of the strategic process. The Board directed members of the Company’s senior management
and advisors to continue negotiating with L3Harris and Bidder C, with the goal of securing a favorable agreement for
consideration for final Board approval over the weekend of December 17 and 18, 2022.
In accordance with the Board’s direction, representatives of Citi and Evercore instructed L3Harris and Bidder C
that they remained in the process and should work towards finalizing any remaining due diligence requirements, open
contract points and the submission of their further revised bids.
Between December 10 and December 16, 2022, Wachtell Lipton continued to negotiate the terms of the merger
agreement with counsel for L3Harris and Bidder C. Members of the Company’s senior management, Citi
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and Evercore continued to engage with L3Harris and Bidder C to answer any remaining diligence questions and
coordinate additional site visits as requested by Bidder C. In accordance with the Board’s direction and recognizing
that the Board was expected to meet the forthcoming weekend, the representatives of Citi and Evercore informed
L3Harris and Bidder C that they should expeditiously complete their remaining due diligence and submit their best
and final bid as soon as possible.
On December 15, 2022, the Board met again and, among other things, received an update on the strategic
process. Mr. Corcoran and Director AA recused themselves from the entirety of the meeting. At the meeting,
representatives of Citi and Evercore provided a brief update on the continued engagement from each of L3Harris and
Bidder C and Wachtell Lipton provided, among other things, an updated summary of the revised terms as negotiated
with each party. Wachtell Lipton noted that the Company was close to an agreement on terms with each of L3Harris
and Bidder C and that the terms provided by L3Harris were generally more favorable for the Company than those
provided by Bidder C.
On December 16, 2022, L3Harris submitted a final bid with revised drafts of the transaction documents,
reiterating its previous $57.00 per share all-cash offer. The representatives of Citi and Evercore informed Bidder C that
another party had submitted a further revised bid that the Board was prepared to consider and invited Bidder C to
submit its best and final bid. The closing price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock on December 16,
2022, was $54.89.
On December 17, 2022, Bidder C indicated that it was not prepared to increase its price above its previous $52.00
per share all-cash offer and did not submit revised drafts of the transaction documents.
Between December 16 and December 17, 2022, the Company and L3Harris and their respective advisors worked
to finalize the definitive transaction documents, with all remaining open points having been substantially resolved by
the morning of December 17, 2022.
The Board met on December 17 to consider the final bids and whether to approve Aerojet Rocketdyne’s entry
into definitive transaction documents providing for, among other things, the merger of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Mr.
Corcoran and Director AA again recused themselves from the entirety of the meeting. At the meeting, Wachtell
Lipton provided an overview of, among other things, the regulatory risk associated with each of L3Harris and Bidder
C and summarized their positions on certain closing certainty provisions in the transaction documents, including on
the reverse break fee and affirmative covenants on each potential buyer between signing and consummation of the
transaction. The Board was also presented with an updated comparison of the merger agreement terms agreed with
L3Harris to those agreed in the Lockheed Martin transaction.
With advice from members of the Company’s senior management and financial advisors, the Board reviewed and
compared the final bids from L3Harris and Bidder C, and discussed, among other things, that Bidder C’s final bid was
substantially lower in value. The financial advisors were asked and they each indicated their view that the Company
had made an outreach to all logical buyers and, to the extent any potential buyer had been overlooked, the public
speculation and reporting about the process and the public awareness of Elliott’s equity stake in the Company since
August 2022 provided ample opportunity for any other interested potential buyer to come forward if they had not
been contacted. The fact that Bidder A had continued to be provided with access to diligence and had been told that
a renewed bid was welcome was also discussed.
Representatives of Citi and Evercore reviewed their preliminary valuation analyses and answered questions from
the Board regarding the valuation of Aerojet Rocketdyne represented by the $57.00 per share all-cash offer from
L3Harris. Wachtell Lipton also discussed with the Board, among other things, its fiduciary duties under Delaware law
in connection with considering the approval of a potential sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne and also reviewed the
respective relationship disclosures from Citi and Evercore. Wachtell Lipton summarized the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the regulatory clearance process for the proposed transaction and the authorizing resolutions that the
Board would approve and answered questions from the Board. The Board discussed with members of the Company’s
senior management and the financial and legal advisors their perspectives on the proposed transaction, including
that Bidder C had not submitted revised drafts of the transaction documents. The Board also discussed, with input
from its financial and legal advisors, that the proposed Merger with L3Harris was more favorable to the Company in
terms of price and transactional certainty and protections than the prior merger agreement in the Lockheed Martin
transaction, and that the terms presented a favorable price for Company stockholders in comparison to the price at
which the Company’s Common Stock was likely to trade in the absence of a transaction. At the conclusion of the
meeting, Ms. Drake recommended to the Board that the
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company proceed to finalize a transaction with L3Harris over the balance of the day and that she be authorized to call
Mr. Kubasik to negotiate a final offer and, among other things, request an increase in the offer price to ensure that the
Board had taken all steps reasonable and appropriate to secure for the Company and its stockholders the highest
price reasonably achievable from any of the potential buyers in the strategic process. After further discussion, the
Board agreed to proceed as recommended by Ms. Drake.
After the meeting, Ms. Drake reached out to Mr. Kubasik to convey Aerojet Rocketdyne’s position. After such
discussion, Mr. Kubasik agreed to increase the merger consideration to $58.00 per share without any change in the
other terms of the merger agreement in order to bring finality to the negotiations with L3Harris and other potential
buyers. Mr. Kubasik further agreed that a joint press release would be issued to announce the transaction, that
L3Harris would commit to being diligent in seeking regulatory clearance and that L3Harris would remain a merchant
supplier.
During the afternoon of December 17, 2022, the Board met again. Mr. Corcoran and Director AA recused
themselves from the entirety of the meeting. The Board again reviewed the summary of proposed terms of the Merger
Agreement with L3Harris previously considered in the morning meeting. Representatives of Citi reviewed its final
financial analysis of the proposed consideration in the proposed transaction with L3Harris, reflecting the increased
price per share of $58.00, as summarized below under “- Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.” Representatives
of Evercore then reviewed its final financial analysis of the proposed consideration in the proposed transaction with
L3Harris, reflecting the increased price per share of $58.00, as summarized below under “- Opinion of Evercore Group
L.L.C.” After discussion among the Board, Citi, Evercore and Wachtell Lipton, Citi and Evercore rendered to the
Board their respective oral opinions, which were later confirmed by the delivery of Citi’s written opinion, dated
December 17, 2022, and the delivery of Evercore’s written opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Board to the effect
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications
set forth therein, the consideration of $58.00 per share to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed
Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. After additional discussions of the proposed
transaction and the matters summarized for the Board at the meeting, the Board (1) approved, adopted and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, (2) determined that the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (3)
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s stockholders for their approval and (4) resolved,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Company’s stockholders
approve the Merger Agreement.
Later in the evening on December 17, 2022, Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris executed and delivered the Merger
Agreement.
On the afternoon of December 18, 2022, Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris issued a joint press release
announcing the transaction.

The Board evaluated, with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors, the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, and, on December 17, 2022, determined that the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and approved, adopted and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger.
In the course of making the recommendation, the Board considered a range of factors, including those below
(which are not necessarily in order of relative importance) relating to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger, each of which the Board believed supported its decision:
•
the Board’s assessment of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business, assets, current and projected financial
performance and condition, earnings, prospects and outlook, including taking into account Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s potential for, and risks and uncertainties to, future growth and value creation;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides the Company’s stockholders immediate
certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Common Stock and enables the Company’s stockholders
to realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution
risk;
36TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the current and historical market prices of the shares of Common Stock, including the market performance
of the shares of Common Stock relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry and
general market indices and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $58.00 per share represented a
premium of approximately 37% to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s closing stock price on August 15, 2022 (the last full
day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Common Stock), and reflected an implied transaction
multiple within the range of select precedent transaction multiples used in the Company’s financial
advisors’ analyses;
•
the Board’s concern regarding the potential impact of any potential economic downturn on the price of
shares of Common Stock (and on the potential valuation that counterparties would be willing to pay);
•
the course and history of the negotiations between Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris, as described under
“- Background of the Merger,” including the fact that the Merger Consideration reflects a substantial
premium and a favorable valuation relative to various metrics and methodologies and the Board’s belief that
L3Harris’s offer of $58.00 per share was L3Harris’s best and final offer;
•
the belief of the Board that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms for the
Company, in the aggregate, to which L3Harris was willing to agree;
•
the fact that there was a substantial multi-phased, auction-style pre-signing market check that included
both strategic and financial bidders, providing confidence that it was unlikely a higher offer price could
have been obtained;
•
the high degree of certainty that the closing will be achieved in a timely manner, in view of the terms of the
Merger Agreement, including, among other things, the provisions and protections increasing the level of
certainty afforded to the Merger ultimately being consummated;
•
the fact that the price of $58.00 per share in cash and the terms of the Merger Agreement were both
superior to the offer price and terms of the Lockheed Martin transaction;
•
the opinions of Citi and Evercore rendered to the Board on December 17, 2022, that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein,
the consideration of $58.00 per share to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “- Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” and “- Opinion of Evercore Group
L.L.C.”;
•
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including:
•
the requirement that the Merger Agreement be approved by the holders of a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement;
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which the Board believed are
reasonable and customary in number and scope;
•
the fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably
practical, the risk that a condition to closing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable
flexibility to operate Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business during the pendency of the Merger, including as
to actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise;
•
the provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board, subject to certain conditions, to provide
information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes a bona fide,
written unsolicited Alternative Proposal;
•
the provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board, subject to certain conditions, to withdraw
or change its recommendation of the Merger Agreement and to terminate the Merger Agreement, in
certain circumstances relating to the presence of a Superior Proposal (or to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event) subject, in certain cases, to paying the
Company Termination Fee;
•
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and L3Harris’s ability to finance the
Merger without difficulty;
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Aerojet Rocketdyne in the
Merger Agreement;
•
the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to specifically enforce L3Harris’s obligations under the Merger
Agreement, including L3Harris’s obligations to complete the Merger;
•
the belief that the Termination Date, as it may be extended, if applicable, allows for sufficient time to
complete the Merger;
•
the fact that L3Harris agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary governmental
approvals as to the Merger, including agreeing to remedies as necessary to obtain any such approval,
subject to certain limitations as to the remedies and actions that L3Harris would be required to take,
which limitations and other relevant provisions are further described under the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the Merger”;
•
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain
circumstances, L3Harris will pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee as more fully described
under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Parent Termination Fee”;
and
•
the Board’s view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested third parties
from making a Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement’s terms and conditions related to a
Change of Recommendation, the Company’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in favor of an
alternative Superior Proposal if certain provisions were satisfied, the payment by the Company of a
Company Termination Fee (the amount of which was on the lower end of the customary range) in
connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, and the Board’s
belief that the overall terms relating to the foregoing were appropriate and favorable to the Company and its
stockholders taking into account the specific circumstances involved (see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Alternative Proposals; Non-Solicitation”).
In addition, the Board also weighed the advantages and benefits against a variety of risks and other potentially
negative factors (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance), including the following:
•
the fact that the Company’s stockholders generally will have no ongoing equity participation in the
Company following the Merger, and that such stockholders will cease to participate in the Company’s
future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of shares of Common
Stock, and will not participate in any potential future sale of the Company to a third party;
•
the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any litigation
that may result from the announcement or pendency of the Merger;
•
the risk that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger
will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if the Merger
Agreement is approved by the Company’s stockholders;
•
the risk that certain HSR Act clearance required to consummate the Merger may not be obtained;
•
the Merger Agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business before the completion of
the Merger, generally requiring the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to
specific limitations and certain exceptions, which may nevertheless delay or prevent the Company from
pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and taking other actions as to its business that the
Company may consider advantageous pending completion of the Merger;
•
the risks and costs to the Company if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management
and employee attention, potential effects on the ability to retain employees and the potential effect on
business and customer and supplier relationships;
•
the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock under the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that certain of the Company’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s stockholders, as further described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “- Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger”;
•
the covenants in the Merger Agreement prohibiting the Company from soliciting other potential acquisition
proposals, and restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain
conditions are satisfied;
•
the requirement that the Company pay the Company Termination Fee, under certain circumstances
following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Company terminates the Merger
Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal, as further described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee”; and
•
the fact that the announcement of the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to
complete the Merger, may cause substantial harm to the Company’s relationships with its employees
(including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key
management, technical, sales and other personnel), suppliers and customers and may divert employees’
attention away from the Company’s day-to-day business operations.
After considering the foregoing factors, the Board concluded that, overall, the potentially beneficial factors
relating to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, outweighed the risks and potentially
negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not exhaustive but is
intended to reflect the material factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger. In view of the complexity and the large number of factors considered, the Board,
individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors. Rather,
the Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition,
individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is forward-looking in nature.
This information should be read in light of the factors described under the caption “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE MERGER PROPOSAL.
Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Aerojet Rocketdyne retained Citi to provide financial advisory services in connection with a possible
transaction involving Aerojet Rocketdyne. In connection with Citi’s engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of
directors requested that Citi evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock of the consideration of $58.00 per share to be received in the proposed Merger by such
holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On December 17,
2022, at a meeting of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors held to evaluate the proposed Merger, Citi rendered
to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Citi’s written opinion and based on and subject
to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the
review undertaken by Citi as set forth in its written opinion, the consideration of $58.00 per share was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.
The full text of Citi’s written opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors,
which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations
and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi’s opinion set forth below is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Citi’s opinion. Citi’s opinion was rendered to the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger and
was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
date of the opinion, to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of the consideration of $58.00
per share. Citi’s opinion did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the proposed Merger or the
Merger Agreement. Citi’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect
the proposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies
that might have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any other transaction in which Aerojet Rocketdyne
might have engaged. Citi’s opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed Merger.
In arriving at its opinion, Citi:
•
reviewed a draft, dated December 17, 2022, of the Merger Agreement;
•
held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Aerojet
Rocketdyne concerning the business, operations and prospects of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
examined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne as
well as certain financial forecasts (the “Projections,” as defined and summarized in the section in this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information” beginning on page 55) and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne which
were provided to or discussed with Citi by the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
reviewed the financial terms of the proposed Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,
among other things, current and historical market prices of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock, historical
and projected earnings and other operating data of Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the capitalization and financial
condition of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
•
considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citi
considered relevant in evaluating the proposed Merger;
•
analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses
of other companies whose operations Citi considered relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne;
and
•
conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial,
economic and market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.
In connection with Citi’s engagement and at the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Citi was requested to
approach, and Citi held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of
all or a part of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The issuance of Citi’s opinion was authorized by Citi’s fairness opinion
committee.
In rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed
by or discussed with Citi, and upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not
aware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With respect to the
Projections and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or otherwise reviewed by or
discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that such forecasts and other
information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
Citi assumed, with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the proposed Merger would
be consummated in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement,
without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory or third-party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed Merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Merger
meaningful to its opinion and analysis. Representatives of Aerojet Rocketdyne advised Citi, and Citi further assumed,
with the consent of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors, that the final terms of the Merger Agreement would
not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citi. Citi did not make and was not provided with an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
otherwise) of Aerojet Rocketdyne nor did Citi make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Aerojet
Rocketdyne. Citi’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to effect the
proposed Merger, the relative merits of the proposed Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that
might have existed for Aerojet Rocketdyne or the effect of any other transaction in which Aerojet Rocketdyne might
have engaged. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi’s opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees
of any parties to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or
otherwise. Citi’s opinion was necessarily based upon information available to Citi, and financial, stock market and
other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date of its opinion. The credit, financial and stock markets, the
industries in which Aerojet Rocketdyne operates, and the securities of Aerojet Rocketdyne have experienced and
may continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no view or opinion as to any potential effects of such
volatility on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger.
In preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those
described below. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Citi arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and
factors assessed as a whole, and it did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or
method of analysis for purposes of its opinion.
In its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet
Rocketdyne. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne
or the Merger, and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect
the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed or the results of
any particular analysis.
The estimates used by Citi for purposes of its analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the
value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Citi’s
analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
Citi was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in the
Merger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed Merger was determined through negotiations
between Aerojet Rocketdyne, on the one hand, and L3Harris and its affiliates, on the other hand, and Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors. Citi’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors in its
evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors or the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne with respect to the proposed Merger, merger consideration or
any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared for and reviewed with the Aerojet
Rocketdyne board of directors in connection with Citi’s opinion, dated December 17, 2022, to the Aerojet Rocketdyne
board of directors. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by, and underlying the opinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described
represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses by Citi. Certain financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial
analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
financial analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses. Future results may be
different from those

TABLE OF CONTENTS
described, and such differences may be material. Approximate implied equity value per share reference ranges
derived from the financial analyses described below and other per share ranges presented for reference purposes
only were rounded to the nearest $0.25, except for data relating to intraday trading share prices. Except as otherwise
noted, financial data utilized for Aerojet Rocketdyne in the financial analyses described below were based on the
Projections and other information and data relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne provided to or discussed with Citi and
approved for Citi’s use by Aerojet Rocketdyne and as further summarized in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on
page 55. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, the term “EBITDA,” when used with respect to any
company, other than Aerojet Rocketdyne, generally refers to that company’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization expenses; the term “adjusted EBITDA,” when used with respect to Aerojet
Rocketdyne, generally refers to EBITDA excluding EBITDA attributable to its real estate segment and
income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation asset/liability.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Citi conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Aerojet Rocketdyne using the Projections. Based on the
Projections, Citi calculated a range of present values (as of September 30, 2022) of the estimated unlevered after-tax
free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate under the Projections during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 through the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2031 (such cash flows
referred to as the “projected cash flows”). For purposes of this analysis, the projected cash flows provided by
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management were adjusted with management’s approval to exclude the impact of cash pension
contributions and reimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows and real estate cash flows (collectively,
the “additional cash flow items”). The additional cash flow items were excluded from the projected cash flows on the
basis that they are significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of
each of the cash pension contributions and reimbursements and net environmental cash flows were reflected as a
liability on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s balance sheet, and real estate cash flows were reflected as assets. For purposes of
this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Citi also calculated a range of estimated
terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%
to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated terminal year unlevered after-tax free cash flows (excluding the additional cash
flow items). The illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates applied was selected by Citi based on its professional
judgment and experience. The range of estimated terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne was then discounted to
present values (as of September 30, 2022) and added to the estimated present values of the projected cash flows in
order to derive ranges of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne.
In calculating the ranges of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne, Citi discounted the projected
cash flows and estimated terminal values using discount rates ranging from 9.2% to 10.1%. Citi derived this range of
discount rates based on a calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of Aerojet Rocketdyne it performed
utilizing the capital asset pricing model with inputs that Citi determined were relevant based on publicly available data
and Citi’s professional judgment. From the range of implied adjusted firm values it derived, Citi subtracted Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s reported net debt and other as of September 30, 2022 (calculated as debt, plus the tax-effected net
present value of net Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) reimbursements and cash pension contributions/other
post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) payments and net cash settlement of stock appreciation rights, less cash, cash
equivalents, reported value of real estate assets held for entitlement and leasing and reported tax effected net
environmental asset/(liability)), and divided the results by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury share method, based on information
provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management. The net present value of net CAS reimbursements and cash pension
contributions/OPEB payments was calculated by discounting CAS reimbursements and cash pension
contributions/OPEB payments reflected in the Projections using, at the direction of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management, a 5.4% after tax cost of debt and 0% perpetuity growth rate. This analysis indicated the following
approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aerojet Rocketdyne (rounded to the nearest $0.25),
as compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share:

Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Citi performed an analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock as of December 16, 2022 based on theoretical future prices calculated by Citi for the shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock under the Projections. Citi derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the
shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock as of December 31 of each of 2023, 2024 and 2025. Based on the
Projections, Citi derived this range of theoretical future values per share by (i) applying illustrative one year forward
adjusted firm value to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined, and as calculated as described, in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”)
multiples of 9.6x to 11.6x to estimates of the Adjusted EBITDA of Aerojet Rocketdyne for each of calendar years 2024,
2025 and 2026, as reflected in the Projections, (ii) adjusting the resulting range of firm values to a range of equity
values by subtracting Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated net debt and other for each period ending as of December 31
(calculated as estimated debt, plus estimated tax effected unfunded pension/OPEB liability and net cash settlement of
stock appreciation rights, less estimated cash, cash equivalents, estimated value of real estate assets held for
entitlement and leasing and estimated tax effected net environmental asset/(liability)), and (iii) dividing the resulting
range of equity values by the number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted
basis, calculated using the treasury share method, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management. The firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples used by Citi were derived based on Citi’s professional
judgment and experience and taking into account historical firm value to Adjusted EBITDA multiples of Aerojet
Rocketdyne during the period from December 19, 2017 through December 18, 2020, the last full trading day prior to
announcement of the proposed merger of Aerojet Rocketdyne with affiliates of Lockheed Martin Corporation. By
applying a discount rate of 9.9%, reflecting a mid-point estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s cost of equity, Citi
discounted to present value as of December 16, 2022 the theoretical future values per share it derived for Aerojet
Rocketdyne, to yield a range of illustrative present values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aerojet Rocketdyne
(rounded to the nearest $0.25), as compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share:

Selected Public Companies Analysis
Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne and the thirteen
publicly traded companies listed below whose operations, for the purposes of Citi’s analysis and based on its
experience and professional judgment, Citi considered generally relevant in evaluating those of Aerojet Rocketdyne,
based on business sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics (such companies collectively,
the “selected companies”).
For the selected companies, Citi calculated and reviewed, among other information, firm values (calculated as
fully diluted market equity value, plus net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests, tax effected unfunded
pension liabilities and less unconsolidated investments and non-operating assets, as applicable) as multiples of
estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA. All calculations in this review were based on closing share prices on
December 16, 2022 and, with respect to the selected companies, financial data (pro forma as applicable) were based on
publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Citi
also calculated and reviewed the firm value of Aerojet Rocketdyne as a multiple of its estimated Adjusted EBITDA of
Aerojet Rocketdyne for calendar year 2023, based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates, as
well as based on the Projections. The estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA multiples observed for the selected
companies and for Aerojet Rocketdyne were as follows:

year 2023 EBITDA multiples of 8.9x to 13.5x to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated calendar year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA,
reflected in the Projections, to derive a range of implied adjusted firm values for Aerojet Rocketdyne. From the range
of implied adjusted firm values it derived, Citi subtracted Aerojet Rocketdyne’s reported net debt and other as of
September 30, 2022 (calculated as debt, plus tax effected reported unfunded pension/OPEB liability and net cash
settlement of stock appreciation rights, less cash, cash equivalents, reported value of real estate assets held for
entitlement and leasing and reported tax effected net environmental asset/(liability)) and divided the results by the
number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the
treasury share method, based on information provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management. This analysis indicated

Miscellaneous
Aerojet Rocketdyne has agreed to pay Citi for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee of
$35.8​ million, $2.5 million of which became payable upon delivery of Citi’s opinion to the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of
directors and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon the consummation of the proposed Merger. In
addition, Aerojet Rocketdyne agreed to reimburse Citi for certain expenses incurred by Citi in performing its services,
and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain liabilities arising out of Citi’s engagement. Citi and its
affiliates in the past have provided services to Aerojet Rocketdyne unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which
services Citi and such affiliates have received compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period
prior to the date of Citi’s opinion, having acted as financial advisor in connection with the terminated merger of
Aerojet Rocketdyne with affiliates of Lockheed Martin Corporation.
As Aerojet Rocketdyne’s board of directors was aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided and
currently are providing certain services to L3Harris unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services Citi and
such affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year
period prior to the date of Citi’s opinion, having acted as financial advisor in connection with the acquisition by
affiliates of L3Harris of Viasat, Inc.’s Tactical Data Links product line, as joint underwriter in connection with the
issuance of certain notes and as lender in connection with certain loans. For the services described above for
L3Harris and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during the two-year period prior to the date of Citi’s opinion,
aggregate fees of approximately $0.3 million.
In the ordinary course of Citi’s business, Citi and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of Aerojet
Rocketdyne or L3Harris for Citi’s own account or for the account of Citi’s customers and, accordingly, may at any
time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citi and its affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its
affiliates) may maintain relationships with Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris and their respective affiliates.

Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.
Aerojet Rocketdyne retained Evercore to provide financial advisory services in connection with the Merger. As
part of this engagement, Aerojet Rocketdyne requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the consideration of $58.00 per share to be received by the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock. On December 17, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the proposed Merger, Evercore rendered to
the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 17,
2022, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications
and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the consideration of $58.00 per share to be received by holders of
shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial
conditions, industry sector performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of
its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The estimates contained in Evercore’s
analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating
to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived
from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available
to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and Evercore
has not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and Evercore further
relied upon the assurances of the management of Aerojet Rocketdyne that they were not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections, Evercore
assumed with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s consent that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of Aerojet Rocketdyne as to the future
financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the other matters covered thereby. Evercore expressed no view as
to the Projections or the assumptions on which they were based.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the final
executed agreement would not differ from the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by Evercore, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore
further assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals
or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or
condition that would have an adverse effect on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the consummation of the Merger or reduce
the contemplated benefits to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock of the Merger.
Evercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Aerojet Rocketdyne and did not
make or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor was
Evercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor has Evercore evaluated the solvency or fair value of
Aerojet Rocketdyne under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s
opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date of its opinion and financial,
economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. It is
understood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore’s opinion and that Evercore does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and Evercore expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the proposed
transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of Aerojet Rocketdyne, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of
any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Aerojet Rocketdyne, or any
class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did
Evercore express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or
the Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other
agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative
merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Aerojet
Rocketdyne, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Aerojet Rocketdyne to engage in the Merger.
Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Board or to any other persons in respect of the
Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock should vote or act in respect
of the Merger. Evercore was not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets
on Aerojet Rocketdyne or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Aerojet
Rocketdyne or the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to pay its obligations when they come due. Evercore is not a legal,
regulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by Aerojet
Rocketdyne and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The
tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore’s financial
analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of such analyses. 
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aerojet Rocketdyne to calculate the estimated present
value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was forecasted to generate
during Aerojet Rocketdyne’s fiscal years 2023 through 2031 based on the Projections. For purposes of this analysis,
the projected cash flows provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management were adjusted with management’s approval
to exclude the impact of cash pension contributions net of reimbursements, net environmental remediation cash flows
and real estate cash flows (collectively, the “additional cash flow items”). The additional cash flow items were
excluded from the projected cash flows on the basis that they are significant items that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management believes are non-perpetual. The impact of cash pension contributions net of reimbursements and net
environmental remediation cash flows were reflected as liabilities on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s balance sheet, and the real
estate cash flows were reflected as an asset. Evercore calculated terminal values for Aerojet Rocketdyne by applying
perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and
experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aerojet Rocketdyne was
forecasted to generate based on the Projections. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then
discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 8.75% to 9.75%, which were
based on an estimate of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s weighted average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow
discounting convention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt (net of
unamortized deferred financing costs), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted cash and adjusted for
stock appreciation rights exercised through December 15, 2022, and for cash settlement of outstanding stock
appreciation rights as of December 15, 2022, per Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management) and net environmental
remediation liability position resulting from government and other reimbursements, in each case, as of September 30,
2022, as reported in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial statements, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s present value of forecast cash
contributions to fund pension liabilities, net of federal government reimbursement for certain pension expenses, for
fiscal years 2023 through 2031, as reflected in the Projections, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s value of real estate held for
entitlement and leasing as of September 30, 2022 as reflected in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial statements, and the
number of fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock
rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $51.00 to $65.50, as compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Public Company Trading Analysis
Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Aerojet Rocketdyne to corresponding financial
multiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the defense industry (the “selected
companies”) which Evercore deemed most relevant to consider in relation to Aerojet Rocketdyne, based on its
professional judgment and experience, because they are public companies with operations that, for purposes of its
analysis, Evercore considered similar to the operations of Aerojet Rocketdyne.
For each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated, based on closing share prices as of December 16, 2022,
enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus total debt, plus after-tax unfunded pension and other
post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) obligations as of December 31, 2021, plus minority interest, less cash and cash
equivalents and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, all as of latest available publicly filed balance sheets unless
otherwise noted) as a multiple of estimated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger - Certain Aerojet Rocketdyne Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,” provided that
when used with respect to companies other than Aerojet Rocketdyne, no adjustments attributable to the Aerojet
Rocketdyne real estate segment and income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation
liability are included in such definition), which we refer to as “2023E Adjusted EBITDA”. Estimated financial data of
the selected companies (pro forma as applicable) were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates.
This analysis indicated the following:

13.0x
Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.
11.9x
Thales SA
8.4x
Median
14.0x
Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and
experience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.5x - 11.5x and
applied this range of multiples to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s estimated fiscal year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA based on the
Projections.
Based on these ranges of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt (net of unamortized
deferred financing costs), cash and marketable securities (excluding restricted cash and adjusted for stock
appreciation rights exercised through December 15, 2022, and for cash settlement of outstanding stock appreciation
rights as of December 15, 2022, per Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management), and net environmental liability position
resulting from government and other reimbursements, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB
liabilities as of December 31, 2021, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s value of real estate held for entitlement and leasing as of
September 30, 2022, in each case, as reported in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial statements, and the number of fully
diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock, in each case as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock
rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $44.50 to $53.50, compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock.
Although none of the selected companies are directly comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Evercore selected
these companies because they are publicly traded defense companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and
experience, considered generally relevant to Aerojet Rocketdyne for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating
the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and
market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected
companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
regarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from
the selected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using the data of the selected companies.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected
transactions involving target companies in the defense and aerospace industries announced since 2015 (the
“selected transactions”). For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined as
the target company’s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total
debt, plus minority interest and after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities (post-Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 effective date, if relevant), less cash and cash equivalents
and net of acquired tax benefits, if relevant) as a multiple of last twelve-month (LTM) Adjusted EBITDA for the target
company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which we refer to as “LTM Adjusted
EBITDA.” Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the
time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Any transactions reported in non-USD values reflect the
applicable foreign exchange rate as of the date of announcement of the relevant transaction.

and net environmental liability position resulting from government and other reimbursements as of September 30,

Rocketdyne’s value of real estate held for entitlement and leasing as of September 30, 2022, in each case, as reflected
in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s financial statements, and the number of fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per
share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $47.75 to $58.50 and $51.00 to $62.50,
respectively, compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.
Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly
comparable to Aerojet Rocketdyne and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger,
Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional
judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to Aerojet Rocketdyne for purposes of its financial analyses.
In evaluating the selected transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business,
economic and market conditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters,
as well as differences in financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target
companies or businesses in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors
that could affect the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the
multiples derived from the selected transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is
not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with
respect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the
following:
Illustrative Sponsor Ability to Pay Analysis
Evercore performed an illustrative sponsor ability to pay analysis to determine the range of price per share of
Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock at which a financial sponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of Aerojet
Rocketdyne based on the Projections. For purposes of its analysis, Evercore assumed a required internal rate of
return in the range of 17.5% to 22.5%, a range of total leverage ratios of 5.0x to 5.5x to the Company’s estimated LTM
Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2022, and an applied exit multiple of 12.7x to the Company’s estimated 2027
LTM Adjusted EBITDA, in each case based on the Projections. Evercore selected the internal rates of return,
leverage ratios and exit multiples based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience. This
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the
nearest $0.25 of $45.50 to $52.00, compared to the consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock.
Historical Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock during the period
beginning on February 13, 2022, the date of termination of the proposed merger of Aerojet Rocketdyne with affiliates
of Lockheed Martin Corporation, and ended December 16, 2022, noting that the low and high closing prices during
such period ranged from $36.59 to $54.89 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock prepared and published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of (i) December 16, 2022, the
last full trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Board, and (ii) August 15, 2022, the last full
day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Common Stock. These price
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
targets reflect analysts’ estimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock at the time the price target was published. The range of selected equity research analyst price targets
per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock was $45.00 to $62.00 as of December 16, 2022, the last full trading
day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Board, and $37.00 to $50.00 as of August 15, 2022, the last
full day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Common Stock. Public market trading price targets published
by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based
are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne and
future general industry and market conditions.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 29 all-cash transactions and announced bids for control
of U.S. public targets by strategic acquirors with an aggregate transaction value between $2 billion and $6 billion
announced since January 1, 2017 (excluding financial, REIT, master limited partnership and pharmaceutical targets,
mergers of equals, acquisitions by financial sponsors, and transactions between related parties). Using publicly
available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration
paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market prices per share of the target
companies one day prior to announcement of each transaction.
This analysis indicated the following:
 
1 Day
Prior
25th Percentile
26.3%
Median
36.9%
Mean
38.3%
75th Percentile
51.6%
Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium
range of 25% to 50% to $42.49, the closing market price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock on August
15, 2022, representing the last full day of unaffected trading of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Common Stock. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the nearest
$0.25 of $53.00 to $63.75, compared to the merger consideration of $58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price
Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future
value of a company’s equity as a function of that company’s next twelve month Adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to
as “NTM Adjusted EBITDA,” and an assumed enterprise value to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiple.
In calculating the implied present value of the future price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock,
Evercore first calculated the implied future enterprise value of the Company by multiplying the Company’s estimated
NTM Adjusted EBITDA as of the end of each of calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, based on the Projections,
by an illustrative enterprise value to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiple range of 9.7x to 11.7x, which was selected
based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to derive an implied future enterprise value reference
range for Aerojet Rocketdyne. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s total debt (net
of unamortized deferred financing costs) as of the end of the applicable year, cash and marketable securities
(excluding restricted cash and adjusted for stock appreciation rights exercised through December 15, 2022, and for
cash settlement of outstanding stock appreciation rights as of December 15, 2022, per Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management) as of the end of the applicable year and net environmental liability position resulting from government
and other reimbursements as of the end of the applicable year, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s after-tax unfunded pension and
OPEB liabilities as of as of the end of the applicable year, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s value of real estate held for
entitlement and leasing as of as of the end of the applicable year, in each case, as based on the Projections, Evercore
calculated a reference range of implied future equity values for Aerojet Rocketdyne. Evercore then divided the
implied future equity values of Aerojet
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rocketdyne for each such year by the number of estimated fully diluted shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common
Stock outstanding for such year, as provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, to calculate a reference range of
implied future equity values per share for the Company. Evercore then discounted the implied share prices back to
December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0%, which were based on an estimate of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s cost of equity. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Aerojet
Rocketdyne Common Stock rounded to the nearest $0.25 of $43.25 to $60.75, compared to the merger consideration of
$58.00 per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Board. In connection with the review of the Merger by Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of
rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s
opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw,
in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its
opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and
experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses
and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual
value of the shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section
not equaling the total of the figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Board as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration of $58.00 per share to the holders of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the
business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative
of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Board
(in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of Evercore’s
opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Board or Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the
Merger for the holders of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Aerojet Rocketdyne has agreed
to pay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $35.8 million, of which $2.5 million was paid upon
delivery of Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger. Aerojet Rocketdyne has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for certain expenses and to indemnify Evercore
against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial
advisory services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and received fees for the rendering of these services. During the two-year
period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory
or other services to L3Harris and Evercore has not received any compensation from L3Harris during such period.
Evercore may provide financial advisory or other services to Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris in the future, and in
connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of
customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,
placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or
54

otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which
any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may
trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity
securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne,
L3Harris, potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or persons that are competitors,
customers or suppliers of Aerojet Rocketdyne or L3Harris.
Aerojet Rocketdyne engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s qualifications,
experience and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides
fairness opinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for
corporate and other purposes.",43,62

While Aerojet Rocketdyne has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Aerojet
Rocketdyne has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections by year as to future
performance, earnings or other results beyond the then current annual period, and is especially wary of making
projections for extended periods, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting
financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However,
Aerojet Rocketdyne is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial
information of Aerojet Rocketdyne on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger (the “Projections”),
prepared by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management, solely because such financial information was given to the Aerojet
Rocketdyne Board and Citi and Evercore as described below. Aerojet Rocketdyne advised the recipients of the
Projections that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in many respects, and the inclusion of the Projections in
this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication of future results or an accurate prediction of future
results, and should not be relied on as such.
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view
toward compliance with published guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
for preparation and presentations of financial projections. This information is prospective and should not be relied
upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on the Projections. The Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the
Company’s management. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any independent
accountants, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections and, accordingly,
the Company’s independent registered accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
on the Projections or their achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the
Projections. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s independent registered public accounting firm’s report, contained in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement, relates to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s historical financial information and does not
extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to
company performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions
and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive
uncertainties and beyond Aerojet Rocketdyne’s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” could cause the Projections or the underlying
assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections,
and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s stockholders are urged to review Aerojet Rocketdyne’s most recent SEC filings for a description of the
reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and any subsequent quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
The inclusion of a summary of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication
that any of Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or
55TABLE OF CONTENTS
other representatives considered the Projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the
Projections should not be relied upon as such nor should the information contained in the Projections be considered
appropriate for other purposes. None of Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris or their respective officers, directors, affiliates,
advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the
Projections. Aerojet Rocketdyne undertakes no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections
to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future
events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections are shown to be in error.
The Company has not made and makes no representation to L3Harris, Merger Sub or any other person, in the
Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Projections or regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne’s ultimate performance
compared to the information contained in the Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Aerojet
Rocketdyne urges all of its stockholders to review Aerojet Rocketdyne’s most recent SEC filings for a description of
the Company’s reported financial results.
Projections
The following is a summary of the unaudited Aerojet Rocketdyne prospective financial information for fiscal
years 2022 through 2031 that was prepared by the Company’s management. The Projections were prepared by
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management in August 2022 and were provided to the Board in connection with its
consideration and evaluation of a potential transaction with L3Harris. The Projections were also provided to Citi and
Evercore and the Board approved the use of, and reliance upon, the Projections by Citi and Evercore in connection
with each firm’s financial analysis and opinion, as discussed in the sections entitled “The Merger - Opinion of
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” and “The Merger - Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.”, respectively. The Projections
are based solely on the information available to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s management at those times, and do not give
effect to the Merger. The summary of the Projections included in this proxy statement are presented to give Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholders access to the financial projections that were made available to the Board, Citi and Evercore.
Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence your decision, if you
are an Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholder, to vote for the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.

EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a GAAP financial measure as it
includes amounts not included in operating income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
This measure should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income (loss) or other measures derived in
accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
(2)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as EBITDA minus capital expenditures and taxes, and adjusted for changes in working capital
and estimated pension and other postemployment benefits contributions, net of stock-based compensation and other net
adjustments. Unlevered Free Cash Flow is not a GAAP financial measure as it excludes amounts included in cash flow from
operations, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. This measure should not be considered as
an alternative to cash flow from operations or other measures derived in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-
GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA refers to EBITDA excluding EBITDA attributable to Aerojet Rocketdyne real estate segment and
income/(expense) related to re-measurement of net environmental remediation asset/liability. Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP
financial measure as it includes amounts not included in operating income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income (loss) or other
measures derived in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
(2)
Adjusted Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Cost Accounting Standards recoveries, less capital
expenditures, less cash taxes, less changes in net working capital and adjusted for other operating adjustments. Adjusted Unlevered
Free Cash Flow excludes cash flows associated with Aerojet Rocketdyne real estate segment, cash pension and other
postemployment benefits contribution payments, and cash flows associated with environmental liabilities. Adjusted Unlevered
Free Cash Flow is not a GAAP financial measure as it excludes amounts included in cash flow from operations, the most directly
comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow
from operations or other measures derived in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures
used by other companies.
General
Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Projections not to be achieved include risks and
uncertainties relating to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business and other factors described under “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” as well as the risk factors with respect to the Company’s business
contained in its most recent SEC filings, which shareholders are urged to review, which may be found as described
under “Where You Can Find More Information.” In addition, the Projections cover multiple future years, and such
information by its nature is less reliable in predicting each successive year. The Projections also do not take into
account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared and do not give effect to
the Transactions, including the Merger, and also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be
completed. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a
result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower than projected.
The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of
Aerojet Rocketdyne or its affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the Projections to be predictive of
actual future events, and the Projections should not be relied on as such. None of Aerojet Rocketdyne or its
affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results
will not differ from the Projections, and none of those persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise
revise or reconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections were prepared
or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the
Projections are shown to be in error. The Company does not intend to publicly update or make any other revision to
the Projections. None of Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or
representatives has made or makes any representation to L3Harris, Merger Sub or any other person regarding
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s ultimate performance compared to the Projections or that the results reflected therein will be
achieved. For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any,
reliance on the Projections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Board that you vote to approve the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Aerojet Rocketdyne directors and executive officers may
have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more
fully described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement
and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby be
adopted by stockholders, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other
matters.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock is $58.00, which is the per share merger
consideration ;
•
the effective time as referenced in this section occurs on January 23, 2023, which is the assumed date of the
effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
the employment of each executive officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne was terminated by the surviving
corporation without cause or due to the executive officer’s resignation for good reason (as such terms are
defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the
assumed date of the effective time of January 23, 2023.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur
or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain
compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides for the treatment set forth below as to the awards held by Aerojet Rocketdyne
directors and executive officers at the Effective Time of the Merger.
Restricted Stock
At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Aerojet Rocketdyne Restricted Stock Award will automatically
(i) vest and be canceled and (ii) be converted into the right to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an
amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the total number of shares subject to such
Restricted Stock Award, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such Restricted Stock
Award. The total number of shares subject to a performance-based Restricted Stock Award will be based on deemed
achievement of maximum performance.
As of January 23, 2023, the Company’s executive officers held an aggregate of 458,868 shares of Common Stock
subject to unvested Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards (all of which RSU Awards are Pre-Signing RSUs
Awards (as defined below)), and the Company’s non-employee directors held an aggregate of 24,925 shares of
Common Stock subject to unvested Restricted Stock Awards.
SARs
At the Effective Time, each outstanding SAR with respect to shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock will
be canceled and converted into the right to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock subject to such SAR multiplied
by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Price Per Share over the per share base price of such SAR. Each outstanding SAR with
respect to which the per share base price equals or exceeds the Price Per Share will be canceled for no consideration
at the Effective Time.
As of January 23, 2023, the Company’s executive officers held an aggregate of 211,577 SARs, and the
Company’s non-employee directors did not hold any SARs.
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RSU Awards
At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Aerojet Rocketdyne RSU Award granted before the execution
of the Merger Agreement will automatically (i) vest and be canceled and (ii) be converted into the right to receive
(subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by
the total number of shares subject to such vested RSU Award, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends
corresponding to such vested RSU Award. The total number of shares subject to a performance-based RSU Award
will be based on deemed achievement of maximum performance.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested Post-Signing RSU Award, excluding any such award granted
to a non-employee director, will be canceled. With respect to each canceled Post-Signing RSU Award:
•
for each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who remains employed with L3Harris or its subsidiaries as
of the L3Harris RSU Award grant date (which grant date will be within 30 days of the closing date), L3Harris
will grant a L3Harris RSU Award with respect to a number of shares of L3Harris common stock, rounded up
to the nearest whole number equal to the product of the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock subject to such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award multiplied by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement), where (x) such L3Harris RSU Award will vest
•
on the same vesting schedule as the canceled Post-Signing RSU Award, based on continued
service following the Effective Time through each applicable vesting date, and
•
upon an earlier termination of employment or service by L3Harris or its affiliates without cause or,
solely with respect to any member of the Executive Leadership Team, an earlier resignation for
good reason, and
(y)
such L3Harris RSU Award will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Post-Signing RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or
•
for each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who is employed by Aerojet Rocketdyne as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who does not remain employed with L3Harris and its subsidiaries as of the
L3Harris RSU Award grant date, such former holder will be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable
withholdings), an amount in cash equal to the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the total number
of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock subject to such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award,
together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such Post-Signing RSU Award.
Quantification of Payments
For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s named executive officers
in respect of their unvested equity awards, see the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” below. The estimated aggregate
amount that would be payable to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s one executive officer who is not a named executive officer in
respect of his 7,735 currently outstanding and unvested Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards at the Effective
Time is $434,398. The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s seven (7) non-
employee directors in respect of their 24,925 currently outstanding and unvested Restricted Stock Awards at the
Effective Time is $1,399,788.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
The Merger Agreement provides that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
now existing in favor of current or former directors or officers of Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its subsidiaries (or
directors or officers of Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its subsidiaries to the extent serving as fiduciaries with respect
to any employee benefit plan maintained by Aerojet Rocketdyne or any of its subsidiaries) as provided in their
respective organizational documents or in any agreements will survive the Merger and will continue at and after the
Effective Time in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, L3Harris
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
will maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s and any of its subsidiaries’ articles or certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents or in any indemnification agreements, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Golden Parachute Payment Mitigation
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Organization & Compensation Committee of the
Board approved the following actions, effective December 1, 2022, to, in part, mitigate the impact of adverse tax
consequences to the Company and to certain Aerojet Rocketdyne executive officers under the golden parachute
provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code: (1) accelerated payment of annual cash incentive awards under the
Aerojet Rocketdyne 2022 Short-Term Incentive Program at 90% of target for each of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s executive
officers, with any remaining amount earned to be certified by the committee and paid in 2023; (2) accelerated vesting
of performance-based restricted stock grants awarded under the Aerojet Rocketdyne 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan
at the 145% payout level for each of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s executive officers, with any remaining amount earned
under such awards to be certified by the committee and vested in 2023; (3) accelerated vesting of performance-based
restricted stock grants awarded under the Aerojet Rocketdyne 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2022 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, in each case at the 200% payout level, for each of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s executive officers,
conditioned on execution of an agreement pursuant to which such accelerated awards may be clawed back under
certain circumstances; and (4) accelerated vesting of time-based equity awards held by each of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s
executive officers that were otherwise scheduled to vest based on continued employment in 2023, 2024 and 2025.
The estimated aggregate amount realized by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s executive officer who is not a named
executive officer under the accelerated vesting described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) of the preceding paragraph (based
upon the closing stock price on December 15, 2022, the date of vesting acceleration) was $317,071. For an estimate of
the amounts that would be payable to each of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s named executive officers under the accelerated
vesting described above, see the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” below.
Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control
Aerojet Rocketdyne is party to an employment agreement with Ms. Drake (the “Drake Employment Agreement”)
under which, if Ms. Drake’s employment is terminated by Aerojet Rocketdyne without cause (including due to a
death or disability) or by Ms. Drake for good reason within the period commencing six months before and ending 24
months following a “change in control,” then Ms. Drake will be entitled to the following payments and benefits: (i)
accrued obligations; (ii) annual target bonus for the pro-rated portion of the fiscal year before the change in control,
paid in a lump sum; (iii) a severance payment equal to three times the sum of (x) Ms. Drake’s base salary and (y)
annual target bonus, paid in a lump sum; (iv) to the extent unvested at the time of Ms. Drake’s termination of
employment, immediate full vesting of all of Ms. Drake’s equity awards (at the maximum level of performance, if
applicable); (v) the opportunity to continue to participate in the Aerojet Rocketdyne life insurance policy in which
she is enrolled before the date of termination at an amount of one times base salary for a period of 12 months
following the date of termination; (vi) provided Ms. Drake timely elects and is eligible for COBRA coverage, payment
of the premiums associated with 24 months of Ms. Drake’s continued participation, without any required
contributions from Ms. Drake (but subject to all other plan terms, including co-payments and deductibles) in the
health benefit plans in which Ms. Drake is enrolled before the date of termination; (vii) the opportunity to continue to
participate in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program for a period of 24 months following termination;
and (viii) outplacement services provided by the company-designated outplacement firm for a period of 18 months
starting no later than ninety (90) days from Ms. Drake’s date of termination, with a maximum value of $25,000 (in each
case, as such terms are defined in the Drake Employment Agreement). Receipt of such compensation and benefits is
contingent on Ms. Drake’s timely execution of a release in the form attached to the Drake Employment Agreement.
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Aerojet Rocketdyne also maintains an executive change in control severance policy (the “CIC Policy”), which
provides all Aerojet Rocketdyne executive officers, other than Ms. Drake, with compensation and benefits upon a
termination of their employment by us without cause or by the executive for good reason (including due to an
executive’s death or “disability”) within the six-month period before a “change in control” (or, if earlier, following the
signing of a definitive agreement that, if consummated, would result in a change in control) through the 24-month
period following a “change in control” (in each case, as such terms are defined in the CIC policy). In the event of an
applicable termination of employment, the executive officer will be entitled to the following:
•
lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of (x) the executive officer’s annual base salary and (y) the
executive officer’s target incentive under the Aerojet Rocketdyne short-term incentive plan (“STIP”);
•
prorated portion of incentive compensation under the STIP for the performance year in which the
termination date occurs (prorated based on length of employment during such performance year), at the
greater of target and actual performance;
•
full STIP payment for the year before the termination date, if unpaid as of the termination date, based upon
actual performance;
•
continued participation in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Physical Program for a period of 24 months
following termination;
•
payment of COBRA benefit premiums until the earlier of the 24-month anniversary of the termination date or
when eligible for health insurance coverage through another employer;
•
to the extent unvested, immediate full vesting of all of the executive officer’s equity awards (at the maximum
level of performance, if applicable); and
•
outplacement services for a period of 12 months starting no later than 90 days from date of termination,
with a maximum value of $15,000.
Receipt of compensation and benefits under the CIC Policy is contingent on the executive officer’s timely
execution of a release in a form prescribed by the Company.
The Merger will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of each of these arrangements.
The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable under the CIC Policy to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s executive
officer who is not a named executive officer upon the Effective Time of the Merger is $2,336,348. For an estimate of
the amounts that would be payable to Ms. Drake under the Drake Employment Agreement and to each of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s named executive officers under the CIC Policy, see the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” below.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each Aerojet Rocketdyne named executive
officer in connection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information
regarding this compensation. Aerojet Rocketdyne executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred
compensation, tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to
the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger. The
ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the
amounts set forth below. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Aerojet Rocketdyne Common Stock is $58.00, which is the per share merger
consideration;
•
the effective time as referenced in this section occurs on January 23, 2023, which is the assumed date of the
effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and

•
the employment of each executive officer of Aerojet Rocketdyne was terminated by the surviving
corporation without cause or due to the executive officer’s resignation for good reason (as such terms are
defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the
assumed date of the effective time of January 23, 2023.

Cash. Amounts reflect estimated double-trigger payments of the lump-sum cash severance that would be provided to the named
executive officer under the terms of the Drake Employment Agreement or the CIC Policy, as applicable, calculated as (i) a pro-
rated annual bonus for 2023, assuming target performance and (ii) three times, in the case of Ms. Drake, or two times, in the case
of Mr. Boehle and Mr. Schumacher, base salary plus target short-term incentive compensation. For each of Ms. Drake and Messrs.
Boehle and Schumacher, the pro-rata bonus component is $4,020,205, $818,692, and $626,529, respectively, and the cash

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
that may be relevant to U.S. holders (as defined below) of Common Stock whose shares are exchanged for cash
pursuant to the Merger. This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders other
than U.S. holders. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(referred to as the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions and
administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the “IRS”), each as in
effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a
retroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions
set forth in this discussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising
under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
of 2010 or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith), nor does it
address any considerations under state, local or foreign tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining
to U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, the conclusions set
forth in this discussion could be subject to challenge, which challenge could be sustained. No ruling has been or will
be sought from the IRS with respect to the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Common Stock that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:
•
a citizen or resident individual of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s
administration, and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust,
or (ii) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock who hold such shares as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion
does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light
of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies,
traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting, U.S. holders subject to any
alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt
organizations, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, tax-qualified retirement plans or other tax-deferred
accounts, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of
the United States, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), S corporations or other pass-through entities or investors in such partnerships or other pass-through
entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. holders who hold shares of Common
Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, U.S. holders required
to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an
applicable financial statement, and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of Common Stock through the exercise of
employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) holds shares of Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a partner in a partnership holding shares of Common Stock, you should consult your tax advisor.
This discussion of material U.S. federal tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not
tax advice. Holders of Common Stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of any alternative minimum tax, the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, state, local, foreign income or other tax
laws.
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder
who receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in its shares of Common Stock surrendered in exchange. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in shares of
Common Stock will generally equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for such shares.
Any such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if
a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Common Stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as
of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are
generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Common Stock at different times or different prices, such U.S.
holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately as to each block of Common Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup
withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the
applicable withholding agent a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury
that such U.S. holder is a “United States person” (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification
number provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded by the IRS or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S.
holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.
Regulatory Approvals
Antitrust Clearance. Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the
Merger, may not be completed until certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR
Act requires that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the FTC. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be
completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act
notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. In certain circumstances the review period may be
extended by either the parties or the Antitrust Division or FTC. Completion of the Merger is conditioned on the
expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The Company and L3Harris filed
their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on January 10, 2023. L3Harris,
in consultation with the Company, withdrew its previous Notification and Report Form on February 9, 2023. L3Harris
resubmitted its Notification and Report Form on February 13, 2023. The applicable waiting period will expire on March
15, 2023, unless extended or terminated earlier.
At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust
Division or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions or
other remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the
antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to
enjoin the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may
also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a
challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be
successful.
Commitments to Obtain Antitrust Approval. The Company, L3Harris, and Merger Sub are each required to, and
to cause their respective affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to
consummate and make effective the Transactions prior to the Termination Date, subject to certain limitations as to the
remedies and actions that L3Harris would be required to take, which limitations and other relevant provisions are
further described under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the
Merger.” 
Filing Fees. L3Harris has agreed to bear the cost of all filing fees payable to any governmental authority in
connection with any filings made to obtain regulatory approval.

Delisting and Deregistration of the Common Stock
If the Merger is completed, the Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Exchange Act.
Appraisal Rights
Under Delaware law, holders of record of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock who do not vote in favor of
approving and adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed, but only if they perfect their appraisal
rights by precisely complying with the required procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL. The appraisal amount
could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of
the Merger Agreement. To exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, stockholders must submit a written demand
for appraisal to Aerojet Rocketdyne prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
must not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and must continue to hold the
shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock of record through the Effective Time. Failure to comply strictly with the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Please see the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights” and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is
reproduced in its entirety as Annex D to this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully
and in their entirety.

for each former Post-Signing RSU Award holder who remains employed with L3Harris or its subsidiaries as
of the L3Harris RSU Award grant date (which grant date will be within 30 days of the closing date), L3Harris
will grant a L3Harris RSU Award with respect to a number of shares of L3Harris common stock, rounded up
to the nearest whole number equal to the product of the total number of shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne
Common Stock subject to such canceled Post-Signing RSU Award multiplied by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement), where (x) such L3Harris RSU Award will vest
•
on the same vesting schedule as the canceled Post-Signing RSU Award, based on continued
service following the Effective Time through each applicable vesting date, and
•
upon an earlier termination of employment or service by L3Harris or its affiliates without cause or,
solely with respect to any member of the Executive Leadership Team, an earlier resignation for
good reason, and
(y)
such L3Harris RSU Award will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and

However, as to the matters described in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and fourteenth bullets

individually or in the aggregate, a disproportionately adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies operating in the
industries in which Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries operate, in which case only the incremental
disproportionate adverse impact on Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries may be taken into account.

or in the aggregate, would prevent or materially delay the closing or materially impair the ability of L3Harris or Merger
Sub to satisfy the conditions to the Merger, to obtain financing for the Merger or to consummate the Merger and the
Transactions.

case, solely to clarify the terms and conditions of any proposal or offer made by any person solely to
determine whether such proposal or offer constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior

binding or non-binding, preliminary or definitive) relating to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be

Merger Sub and their respective representatives) return or destroy all confidential information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement between the Company and
such person.
The Company must enforce, and not waive, terminate, amend or modify without L3Harris’s prior written consent,
any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement (if any) to which
the Company is a party, in each case, that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Board,
provided that the Company may grant waivers of standstill and similar provisions to the extent the Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Company will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt) notify L3Harris in writing of (i) the
receipt by the Company of an Alternative Proposal or (ii) any proposal or offer received by the Company with respect
to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, which notice will include (A) a copy of
any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal made in writing (including any draft agreements or term sheets,
financing commitments and other agreements submitted therewith) and (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal not made in writing. In addition, from and after the

provisions of the Merger Agreement, (y) keep L3Harris reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and

Stockholder Vote is obtained, if the Company receives a bona fide written unsolicited Alternative Proposal that the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with certain
provisions of the Merger Agreement: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative
Proposal, as well as its representatives and potential financing sources, if, and only if, before so furnishing such
information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions as to
confidential treatment of information and other terms that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than the confidentiality provisions and other terms of the confidentiality agreement between L3Harris and
the Company (provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or
otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal on a confidential basis, but such
confidential basis, but such confidentiality agreement will not prohibit the Company or its subsidiaries from
providing any information contemplated by the Merger Agreement to L3Harris, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives) (provided further, that any such nonpublic information has previously been provided to L3Harris or
is provided to L3Harris before or substantially concurrently with the time such information is furnished to such third
party), and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party as to the Alternative Proposal, in each case,
subject to the requirement that the Company must:

Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or (B) assets of the Company and its subsidiaries to
which more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, are attributable for the most recent fiscal year for which the audited financial
statements are then available; or
•
the direct or indirect acquisition by any person of, or a tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning, more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares.
A “Superior Proposal” means an unsolicited Alternative Proposal substituting in the definition thereof “fifty
percent (50%)” for “twenty percent (20%)” in each place it appears, that the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company’s outside financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Board
considers in good faith to be relevant (including the conditionality, timing and likelihood of consummation of such
proposal), to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s stockholders than the Transactions
(after taking into account any changes thereto committed to by L3Harris under the Merger Agreement).
Change in the Aerojet Rocketdyne Board Recommendation
The Board has recommended that Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. The
Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the exceptions noted below, the Board may not:
•
withhold or withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to L3Harris or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to
withhold or withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to L3Harris or Merger Sub), the Board
Recommendation;
•
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable,
any Alternative Proposal;
•
fail to include the Board Recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
fail to publish, send or provide to the holders of shares of Common Stock, under Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, a statement recommending against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange
offer and publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten (10) business days after the commencement
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or fail to
maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such offer has expired or been
withdrawn; or
•
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Any action referred to in the clauses above is a “Change of Recommendation.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the
Merger Agreement permits the Board to, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited Alternative Proposal received
by the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement, make a Change of Recommendation or cause the Company
to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal, subject to the requirements that:
•
the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of the Merger Agreement that have been irrevocably offered by L3Harris in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
the Company provides prior written notice to L3Harris, at least three business days in advance, that it
intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal, which notice specifies the identity of the person making such proposal and a summary
of the material terms thereof and includes a copy of the proposed Superior Proposal and the proposed
acquisition agreement, if any, with respect thereto;
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
during the three business day period following the date on which notice was received (or the two business
day extension, in the event of any change to (i) the financial terms or (ii) other material terms of such
Superior Proposal), the Company and its representatives negotiate with L3Harris in good faith to consider
amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as L3Harris may propose;
•
upon the conclusion of the three business day period, the Board consider in good faith any revisions to
the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by L3Harris and determine, after consultation with
the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and
•
provided that in the event of any modification of the financial terms or any other material modifications to
the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company delivers a new written notice to L3Harris and again
complies with the requirements of such notice, except that the notice period in such instance will only be
two business days.
In addition, the Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation (before obtaining the Required Company
Stockholder Vote) in response to an Intervening Event if the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably
likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law except that the Board will not be entitled to make
such a Change of Recommendation (i) unless the Company has given L3Harris at least two business days’ written
notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising L3Harris of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation,
which Intervening Event Notice will include a description of the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) unless during such
two (2) Business Day period, if requested by L3Harris, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives will engage with L3Harris and its Representatives to consider amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would permit the board of directors, consistent with its fiduciary
duties, not to make such Change of Recommendation and (iii) unless, at the end of such notice period, after taking
into account any proposals irrevocably made by L3Harris in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during the
period following delivery of such Intervening Event Notice, the board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Intervening Event remains in
effect and that the failure of the board of directors to make such Change of Recommendation contemplated by clause
(i) or (iii) of the definition thereof would reasonably likely continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
An “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development first occurring or arising after the
date of the Merger Agreement that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that (i) is
unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the material
consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) does not involve or relate to an Alternative Proposal.

L3Harris has agreed to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain funds sufficient to fund (i) all
amounts required to be paid as Merger Consideration in the Merger, (ii) any fees and expenses of or payable by

For twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, L3Harris is required to provide each current and former
Aerojet Rocketdyne employee with (i) base compensation and annual cash incentive opportunities that, in each case,
are no less favorable than were provided to such employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other
compensation and employee benefits (excluding transaction bonus payments, defined benefit pension, non-qualified
deferred compensation and retiree medical coverage, but including annual long-term target equity incentive
opportunity) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to Aerojet Rocketdyne employees
immediately before the Effective Time. L3Harris is required to provide to each Aerojet Rocketdyne employee whose
employment terminates during the one (1)-year period following the Effective Time severance benefits equal to the
severance benefits that would have been provided to such employee under the Aerojet Rocketdyne severance
arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such one (1)-year period following the
Effective Time, severance benefits offered to each Aerojet Rocketdyne employee must be determined without taking
into account any reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid or benefits provided to such employee.
Compensation and employee benefits for Aerojet Rocketdyne employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be provided in accordance with the applicable collective
bargaining agreement as in effect from time to time.
For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the
employee benefit plans of L3Harris providing benefits to any Aerojet Rocketdyne employees after the Effective Time
(the “New Plans”), L3Harris will credit each current and former Aerojet Rocketdyne employee with his or her years of
service with Aerojet Rocketdyne and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Aerojet Rocketdyne employee plan in which such employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing will not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any final
average pay defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits.
In addition, (i) each current and former Aerojet Rocketdyne employee will be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to an
Aerojet Rocketdyne plan in which such employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing health benefits to any Aerojet
Rocketdyne employee, L3Harris will waive all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan for such employee and

his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Aerojet
Rocketdyne plans in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and L3Harris will
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-

laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions before the End Date, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or

and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action

third parties, (iii) the defending of any actions, lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, including seeking
to have any stay, temporary restraining order or injunction entered by any court or other governmental entity vacated
or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the

without the prior written consent of L3Harris, will the Company and its subsidiaries be permitted) to pay before the
Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration (other than customary filing and notification fees with
governmental entities and other nominal amounts) to any third party for any consent or approval required for or
triggered by the consummation of the Transactions under any contract or agreement or otherwise.
The Company, L3Harris and Merger Sub have agreed to cooperate and consult with each other in connection
with the making of all registrations, filings, notifications, communications, submissions and any other actions
pursuant to certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions
of any governmental entity. Subject to applicable law relating to the exchange of information, the Company, on the
one hand, and L3Harris and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will permit counsel for the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed notifications or filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to any such
notification, filing, written communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith to any governmental
entity except that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of
the Company and its subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect thereto, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual agreements and (z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. The
parties, as they deem advisable and necessary, may designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under certain provisions of the Merger Agreement as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material,” and such materials
and the information contained therein must be given only to outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and may not be
disclosed to other representatives of the recipient unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials or its legal counsel. Each of the Company, L3Harris and Merger Sub agreed not to participate
in any meeting or discussion, either in person, by videoconference, or by telephone, with any governmental entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such governmental entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.
Antitrust Matters. The Company and L3Harris have agreed to (i) promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15)
business days after the date of the Merger Agreement, file or cause to be filed any and all required notification and
report forms under the HSR Act as to the Merger and the other Transactions, and use all reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) supply or cause to be
supplied to any governmental entity as promptly as practicable any additional information or documentary material
that may be requested under any law or by such governmental entity and (iii) take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including taking all such further action as may be

necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities, or any other governmental entity
or person may assert under any law as to the Merger and the other Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any law that may be asserted by any governmental entity as to the Merger so as to enable
the closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date), including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license, hold separate or disposition of any and all of the share capital or other equity voting interest, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines of L3Harris or its subsidiaries or
affiliates or of the Company or its subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after
the closing would limit L3Harris’s or its subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) or affiliates’ freedom of
action as to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s), assets
(whether tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines, in each case as may be
required in order to satisfy the conditions to closing or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any action that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the closing, delaying the closing in any material respect or delaying the closing beyond the End Date
(individually or collectively, a “Remedial Action”).
Notwithstanding the above, neither the Company, L3Harris nor any of their respective subsidiaries will be
required to become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action as to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order to sell, divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets (whether tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions,
operations, products or product lines of the Company, L3Harris or any of their respective affiliates, unless such
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is conditioned upon the occurrence of the closing or is or
becomes effective on or after the closing; provided that, notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the
contrary, nothing will require any of L3Harris or any of its affiliates to (A) waive any of the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement as they apply to L3Harris or Merger Sub or (B) agree or otherwise be required to, take any action,
including any Remedial Action that, individually or in the aggregate together with one or more other Remedial
Actions, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of L3Harris, the Company, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole and after giving effect to the
Merger (it being understood that, for purposes of determining under this clause (B) whether such Remedial Action
would reasonably be expected to have such a material adverse effect (aa) L3Harris, the Company and their respective
subsidiaries, taken as a whole and after giving effect to the Merger, will be deemed to be the same size as the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and before giving effect to the Merger, and (bb) any proceeds
received, or expected to be received, from effecting any Remedial Action will not be taken into consideration). In no
event will the Company propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any Remedial Action without the prior written consent
of L3Harris. Except as otherwise permitted under the Merger Agreement, the Company, L3Harris and Merger Sub will
not (and will cause their subsidiaries and affiliates not to) make, or agree to make, any acquisition, or knowingly take,
or agree to take, any other action outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, in each case,
that would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the closing.

L3Harris and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents or in any agreement will survive the Merger and will continue at and after the Effective Time in full force
and effect. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, L3Harris and the Surviving Corporation will maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and any of its
subsidiaries’ articles or certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, and will not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action pending or
asserted or any claim made within
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
such period will continue until the final disposition of such action or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such
six (6)-year period. From and after the Effective Time, L3Harris will assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor their
obligations under the Merger Agreement.
In addition, before the Effective Time, Aerojet Rocketdyne will obtain, and prepay the premium for, a six year
“tail” insurance policy for claims against the Company’s and its subsidiaries current and former directors and officers
arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time. Any such tail policy must
have at least the same coverage and amounts and contain terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
covered individuals as the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy with a
claims period of six years from the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will such tail policy
have a total premium amount greater than 300% of the annual premium most recently paid by the Company for its
existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy as of the date of the Merger Agreement (such amount, the
“Maximum Amount”). If such tail policy is not reasonably available or the premium of such tail policy exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Company will obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a total premium not
exceeding the Maximum Amount. If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy before the Effective Time, L3Harris or
the surviving corporation will obtain such a tail policy.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Aerojet
Rocketdyne is providing its stockholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal, as described in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet
Rocketdyne’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Payments,” including the footnotes
to the table and related narrative discussion.
The Board recommends that the stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s named
executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the agreements or understandings under which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case, as disclosed under Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in
the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Payments,” including the footnotes to the table and the
related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and
vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Aerojet
Rocketdyne or L3Harris. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation may be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation
agreements and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Aerojet Rocketdyne
stockholders.
The above resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s named executive
officers on an advisory (non-binding) basis requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and that vote thereon.
The Board recommends that the stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

The Company’s stockholders are being asked to approve the Adjournment Proposal. If the Adjournment
Proposal is approved, the Special Meeting could be adjourned by the Board to any date (subject to certain limitations
in the Merger Agreement). Aerojet Rocketdyne may not postpone, recess or adjourn the Special Meeting without
L3Harris’s prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if Aerojet Rocketdyne reasonably believes that
there will be insufficient shares represented (either virtually or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Special Meeting or to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote, Aerojet
Rocketdyne may adjourn, recess or postpone the Special Meeting for a reasonable time, in any case, no longer than
10 business days, to solicit additional proxies or (ii) if L3Harris reasonably believes that there will be insufficient
shares represented (either virtually or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Special Meeting or to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote, L3Harris may request that Aerojet Rocketdyne
adjourn, recess or postpone the Special Meeting for a reasonable time, in any case, no longer than 10 business days,
to solicit additional proxies. If the Special Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before their use. If you
sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy
and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the
Adjournment Proposal, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved by the
requisite number of shares of Common Stock at the Special Meeting.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on Merger Proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Adjournment Proposal and
vice versa.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common
Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and that vote thereon.
The Board recommends that the stockholders of Aerojet Rocketdyne vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal,
if a vote on the Adjournment Proposal is called.

The following table sets forth certain information, as of February 9, 2023, regarding the beneficial ownership of
80,677,246 shares of Common Stock as to:
•
each person that is a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock;
•
each director;
•
each named executive officer; and
•
all directors and executive officers as a group.
The amounts and percentages of Common Stock beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of
the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is
deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power
to vote or direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct
the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person
has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Securities that can be so acquired are deemed to be
outstanding for purposes of computing such person’s ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any
other person’s percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same
securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no
economic interest. Except as otherwise indicated, each of the beneficial owners has, to our knowledge, sole voting
and investment power as to the indicated shares of Common Stock. In addition, except as otherwise indicated, the
address of each of the directors and executive officers of the Company is c/o Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc., 222 N. Pacific
Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, CA 90245. The below beneficial ownership information includes shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options within 60 days of February 9, 2023. There are no longer any
stock options outstanding.

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who have complied exactly with the procedures set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL, including stockholders who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) continuously hold their shares of our Common Stock through the Effective
Time of the Merger; and (iii) properly demand appraisal of their shares of Common Stock in compliance with the
requirements of Section 262 are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Section 262
and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of
record of shares of Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder’s
name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Common Stock held of record in the name of another person,
such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized
below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a
bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker
or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of Common Stock who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) continuously hold their shares of Common Stock
through the Effective Time of the Merger; and (iii) otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262,
will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the
Effective Time of the Merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days before the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to exercise
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement constitutes Aerojet Rocketdyne’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection
with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with
the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve
such holder’s right to do so should review Annex D carefully.
Failure to comply exactly with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in
the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. 
A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to
seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that if a stockholder considers exercising
such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must, among
other requirements, do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written demand for appraisal that complies with
Section 262 before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; and
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Common Stock through the Effective Time of the
Merger.
90TABLE OF CONTENTS
The stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must also file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of
the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger
Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, abstain or not vote its shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Aerojet Rocketdyne,
before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at the Special
Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be
submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder
must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date
the written demand for appraisal is made, and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time
of the Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and it will constitute a
waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy
containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby nor
abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A stockholder’s failure to make the
written demand before the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby at the Special Meeting will result in a loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Only a holder of record of shares of Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in such holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Aerojet Rocketdyne of the identity of
the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares of common stock in
connection with the Merger. If the shares of Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint
owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the
record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK
ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD
CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW
PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal under Section 262 should be delivered to:
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.
Attn: Corporate Secretary
222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500
El Segundo, California 90245
Any holder of shares of Common Stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the
consideration offered under the Merger Agreement by delivering to Aerojet Rocketdyne a written withdrawal of the
demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective
Time of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that such dismissal will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time of the
Merger.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will
notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal under Section 262 and
who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that
the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof, and include with such notice a copy of Section 262.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of
Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of
the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has
no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a
petition or initiate any negotiations as to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of
shares of Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed by Section
262. The failure of a holder of shares of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262
will nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who has complied
with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as to which Aerojet Rocketdyne has received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail
this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement
or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A
beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing
statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Common Stock and a copy thereof is served
upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders
who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not
been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the
92
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who
have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require stockholders demanding appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to
the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder
fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceeding unless (i) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the
value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds $1
million.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
appraise the “fair value” of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the fair value is
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued
during the pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, to the former Aerojet
Rocketdyne stockholders entitled to receive the same (in the case of shares represented by certificates, payment will
not be made until such certificates are surrendered to the surviving corporation). At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each former stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between
the amount paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all
relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would
receive under the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking
firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,
and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Aerojet Rocketdyne believes that the
Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Aerojet Rocketdyne
nor L3Harris anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights,
and each of Aerojet Rocketdyne and L3Harris reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for
purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a
petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal
proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees
93
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the
parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a
stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and
expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares of Common
Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no
petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be
entitled to vote such shares of Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Common Stock, if any,
payable to stockholders as of a time before the Effective Time of the Merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or
if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger or thereafter with the written
approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition
for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as
to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval
of the court.
Failure to comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a
stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is
encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

If the Merger is completed in the first half of 2023, the Company does not expect to hold a 2023 annual meeting

Members of the Board:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common
stock of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (“AR Holdings”) of the Consideration (defined below) to be received by
such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”), proposed to be entered into among AR Holdings, L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“Parent”), and
Aquila Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As more fully described in the Merger
Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into AR Holdings (the “Merger”) and (ii) each outstanding share
of the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of AR Holdings (“AR Holdings Common Stock”) other than shares of
AR Holdings Common Stock held by AR Holdings or any wholly owned subsidiary of AR Holdings or held by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $58.00 (the “Consideration”) plus,
if the Merger has not closed by the date specified in the Merger Agreement, the Additional Consideration (as defined
in the Merger Agreement). We express no opinion on the Additional Consideration.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated December 17, 2022 of the Merger Agreement and held
discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of AR Holdings concerning
the business, operations and prospects of AR Holdings. We examined certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to AR Holdings as well as certain financial forecasts and other information and data
relating to AR Holdings which were provided to or discussed with us by the management of AR Holdings. We
reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to, among other things:
current and historical market prices of AR Holdings Common Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other
operating data of AR Holdings; and the capitalization and financial condition of AR Holdings. We considered, to the
extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which we considered relevant in evaluating
the Merger and analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the
businesses of other companies whose operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of AR Holdings. In
connection with our engagement and at the direction of AR Holdings, we were requested to approach, and we held
discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of AR
Holdings. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such
other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The
issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our fairness opinion committee.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed
by or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of AR Holdings that they are not aware of any
relevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us. With respect to financial forecasts and
other information and data relating to AR Holdings provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, we
have been advised by the management of AR Holdings that such forecasts and other information and data were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
AR Holdings as to the future financial performance of AR Holdings.

We have assumed, with your consent, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms,
conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party
approvals, consents and releases for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on the Merger meaningful to our opinion and analysis. Representatives of AR
Holdings have advised us, and we further have assumed, with your consent, that the final terms of the Merger
Agreement will not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by us. We have not made or been
provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of AR
Holdings nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of AR Holdings. Our opinion does
not address the underlying business decision of AR Holdings to effect the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for AR Holdings or the effect of any other
transaction in which AR Holdings might engage. We also express no view as to, and our opinion does not address,
the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or
otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information available to us, and financial, stock market and other
conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date hereof. As you are aware, the credit, financial and stock
markets, the industries in which AR Holdings operates, and the securities of AR Holdings have experienced and may
continue to experience volatility and we express no view or opinion as to any potential effects of such volatility on
AR Holdings or the Merger.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has acted as financial advisor to AR Holdings in connection with the proposed
Merger and will receive a fee for such services, of which a portion is payable upon delivery of this opinion and the
principal portion is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, AR Holdings has agreed to
reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We and our
affiliates in the past have provided services to AR Holdings unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we
and such affiliates have received compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to the
date hereof, having acted as financial advisor in connection with the terminated merger of AR Holdings with affiliates
of Lockheed Martin Corporation. As you further are aware, we and our affiliates in the past have provided, and
currently provide, services to Parent unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we and such affiliates
have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to
the date hereof, having acted as financial advisor in connection with the pending acquisition by affiliates of Parent of
Viasat, Inc.’s Tactical Data Links product line, as joint underwriter in connection with the issuance of certain notes
and as lender in connection with certain loans. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may
actively trade or hold the securities of AR Holdings and Parent for our own account or for the account of our
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, we and our
affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with AR Holdings, Parent and their
respective affiliates.
Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information of the Board of
Directors of AR Holdings in its evaluation of the proposed Merger, and our opinion is not intended to be and does
not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters
relating to the proposed Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described above
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described above
and other factors we deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration is fair, from

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“Acquiror”), and Aquila Merger
Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares owned by the Acquiror,
Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror or by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $58.00 per Share in cash (the “Consideration”) plus, if the Merger has not closed
by the date specified in the Merger Agreement, the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
We express no opinion on the Additional Consideration. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set
forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Consideration to be received by holders of the
Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we
deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us
by management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the
Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of
certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger
with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed
relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 17, 2022, of the Merger
Agreement; and
(viii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available
to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not
assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon
the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Forecasts, we

We understand that Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“Acquiror”), and Aquila Merger
Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares owned by the Acquiror,
Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror or by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $58.00 per Share in cash (the “Consideration”) plus, if the Merger has not closed
by the date specified in the Merger Agreement, the Additional Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
We express no opinion on the Additional Consideration. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set
forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Consideration to be received by holders of the
Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we
deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us
by management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the
Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of
certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger
with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed
relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 17, 2022, of the Merger
Agreement; and
(viii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available
to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not
assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon
the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would

have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance
of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Forecasts or the assumptions
on which they are based.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the
final executed Merger Agreement will not differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have
further assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents,
approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation,
restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or
reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made
or assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company
under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based
upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as
they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the
fairness to the holders of the Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration. We do
not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative
to the Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does
not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the
structure or form of the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our opinion does not
address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available
to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger. Our
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the
Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the
Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common Stock will trade at
any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the
Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company
to pay its obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed
the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory,
accounting and tax matters.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee
for our services, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to
indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date
hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to the Company and
received fees for the rendering of these services. During the two year period prior to the

date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other
services to the Acquiror and we have not received any compensation from the Acquiror during such period. We may
provide financial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror in the future, and in connection with
any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own accounts and
the accounts of customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research,
private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or
otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their respective employees, as well as investment
funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short
positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt
or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to the
Company, the Acquiror, potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or persons that are
competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company or the Acquiror.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of this
opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party
for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval, except the Company may reproduce this opinion
in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and required to
be mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be
received by holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
 
Very truly yours,

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:
(i) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the
Company (such shares, collectively, the “Common Stock,” and each, a “Share”) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive (A) $58.00 per Share in cash, plus (B) the Additional
Consideration (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”). All Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically Canceled
upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
(ii) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share that is owned by the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company as treasury stock or otherwise, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any
shares of Common Stock held by any Company Employee Plan or trust related thereto (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity
Plans or the ESPP), or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Canceled Shares”) shall be Canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(b) Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by
the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
A-2TABLE OF CONTENTS
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Canceled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who
have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares, as applicable (the “Dissenting Shares”), pursuant to,
and who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under and complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Appraisal Rights”) shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood and
acknowledged that such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be Canceled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to
receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights); provided,
however, that if any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under
the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(a), without interest thereon. “Proposed Dissenting Shares” means shares of Common Stock
whose holders provide demands for appraisal to the Company prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and
do not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the Appraisal Rights. At
the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the Appraisal Rights and as provided in the first sentence of this Section 2.1(b). The Company shall give Parent
(i) notice and copies of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) the reasonable
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or to otherwise comply with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
Shares of the Company shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.1(c)
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates or

the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective

transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of
the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article 2.

investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of

thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.
(e) Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by
the former holders of Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,

previously entitled thereto. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, none of

as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.

the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares of the Company. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d).
(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

RSU Award”) with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest
whole number equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Canceled and forfeited Company Post-Signing RSU Award, multiplied by (B) the Equity Award

Stock subject to such Canceled and forfeited Company Post-Signing RSU Award, together with any
accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such Company Post-Signing RSU Award, which amount

Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party);
provided, however, that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which any of the foregoing restrictions apply to allow access in a manner
that does not result in such effect, or (ii) to such information that relates to the minutes of the meetings of the
Board of Directors or its committees where the Board of Directors or any applicable committee discussed the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any similar transaction between the Company and any other
Person (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Board of Directors, whether in
connection with a specific meeting, or otherwise relating to such subject matter). Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make
any disclosure pursuant to this Section 5.3 to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a
litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to become adverse parties. To
the extent that the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with
applicable antitrust Laws, information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.3 may be disclosed subject to
execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for
Parent, provided, that such disclosure would reasonably permit the disclosure of information without violating
applicable Law or jeopardizing applicable legal privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above to provide access to employees, officers,
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any other documents and information by electronic
means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under the applicable Law
(including any COVID-19 Measures).
(b) Parent agrees that all information provided to it or any of its Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be
Confidential Information, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of September 20, 2022, between the Company and Parent (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.4, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the Termination Date, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing or providing access to non-public information) the making or submission of,
any indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Alternative Proposal or furnish (or continue to furnish) any nonpublic information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives) that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making an Alternative
Proposal (except, in each case, solely to clarify the terms and conditions
A-35TABLE OF CONTENTS
of any proposal or offer made by any Person solely to determine whether such proposal or offer constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal), or (iii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement
in principle or any other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or non-binding, preliminary or definitive)
relating to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal (except
for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.4(d)). From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
terminate, amend, modify or waive any standstill, non-use or non-disclosure provision with respect to an
Alternative Proposal of any confidentiality agreement, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries entered into with the intent of exploring a potential Alternative Proposal; provided, that
the Company may grant waivers of standstill and similar provisions to the extent the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(b) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives, to
(i) immediately following the execution of this Agreement cease and cause to be terminated any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives) in connection with any Alternative Proposal, (ii) terminate access to any physical or electronic
data rooms hosted by or on behalf of the Company by any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives) and (iii) deliver written notice to each such Person requesting that such Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) return or destroy all confidential
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable confidentiality
agreement between the Company and such Person.
(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt) notify Parent in writing of
(i) the receipt by the Company of an Alternative Proposal or (ii) any proposal or offer received by the Company
with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, which notice shall
include (A) a copy of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal made in writing (including any draft
agreements or term sheets, financing commitments and other agreements submitted therewith) and (B) a
summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal not made in
writing. In addition, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall (x) notify Parent in writing if the Company
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 5.4(d), (y) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects of the status and terms (including any material change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal)
of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal and (z) provide Parent promptly after the receipt or delivery
of copies of all written proposals, offers or draft agreements sent or provided to the Company, its Affiliates or its
Representatives from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any such Alternative
Proposal, inquiry, offer or proposal.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, if at any time following the date hereof
and prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote the Company receives a bona fide, written
unsolicited Alternative Proposal and that the Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
its outside legal and financial advisors could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the
Company may, subject to compliance with Section 5.4(c) in all material respects, take the following actions: (x)
furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal, as well as its Representatives
and potential financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has
executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions as to confidential treatment of
information and other terms that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the
confidentiality provisions and other terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal on a confidential basis, but such confidentiality agreement
shall not prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries from providing any information contemplated by this Section
5.4 to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives) (provided, however, that any such non-public
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time such information is furnished to such third party), and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the third party with respect
A-36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the Alternative Proposal. It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or
negotiations to the extent permitted under this Section 5.4(d) shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Change of
Recommendation or constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(ii).
(e) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, the Board of Directors shall not (i) withhold or withdraw (or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify
in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (iv) fail to publish, send or provide to the holders of
Shares, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act a statement recommending against any Alternative
Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer and publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten (10) Business
Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer
or exchange offer or fail to maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such offer has
expired or been withdrawn or (v) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any such action, a “Change of
Recommendation”). Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining
the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Board of Directors may, in response to a bona fide, written
unsolicited Alternative Proposal received by the Company after the date of this Agreement and that the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel
would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that have been offered by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.4(e) (x) make a Change of
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i) in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal substantially concurrently with such termination; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall
not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation or cause such termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i) unless, in each case, (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least three (3)
Business Days’ written notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a
Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which Superior Proposal Notice shall include a
description of the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the
Board of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and a copy of any written offer or
proposal, proposed definitive agreement, proposed or committed financing documentation and any other related
documents for such Superior Proposal, if any, (B) during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall engage with Parent and its
Representatives to consider amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner so
that such Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of such notice
period, after taking into account any proposals irrevocably made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this
Agreement during the period following delivery of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Board of Directors
concludes in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided that
in the event of any modification of the financial terms or any other material modifications to the terms of such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply
with the requirements of this Section 5.4(e) with respect to such new written notice, except that the notice period
under clause (A) shall be two (2) Business Days.
(f) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Required
Company Stockholder Vote, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of
Recommendation contemplated by clause (i) or (iii) of the definition thereof if the Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably likely be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to
make such a Change of Recommendation (i) unless the Company shall have given Parent at least two (2)
Business Days’ written notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a
Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice shall
A-37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
include a description of the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) unless during such two (2) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall engage with
Parent and its Representatives to consider amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a
manner that would permit the Board of Directors, consistent with its fiduciary duties, not to make such Change
of Recommendation and (iii) unless, at the end of such notice period, after taking into account any proposals
irrevocably made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during the period following delivery
of such Intervening Event Notice, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Intervening Event remains in effect and that
the failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of Recommendation contemplated by clause (i) or (iii)
of the definition thereof would reasonably likely continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.
(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i)
taking or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure
of the Board of Directors to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law; provided, that
(A) any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Change of Recommendation may only be made in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f) and (B) any public disclosure
made by or on behalf of the Company that refers to an Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation (including for purposes of Section 7.1(g)(ii)) unless the Board of Directors expressly reaffirms
the Recommendation in such disclosure. A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation.
(h) “Alternative Proposal” means any indication of interest, inquiry, proposal or offer made by any
Person or group of Persons (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) for or that would result in (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving the Company, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of (A) more than twenty percent
(20%) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or (B) assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to which more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues or earnings of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are attributable for the most recent fiscal year for which the audited
financial statements are then available, or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of, or a tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning, more than twenty percent
(20%) of the outstanding Shares, in each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), whether in a single or series of
related transactions.
(i) “Superior Proposal” means an unsolicited Alternative Proposal, substituting in the definition thereof
“fifty percent (50%)” for “twenty percent (20%)” in each place it appears, that the Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial and legal advisors, and considering such
factors as the Board of Directors considers in good faith to be relevant (including the conditionality, timing and
likelihood of consummation of such proposal), to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Company’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
changes thereto committed to by Parent pursuant to Section 5.4(e)).
(j) “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development first occurring or arising
after the date hereof that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that (i) is
unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date hereof, or if known and
reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date hereof, the material consequences of which were
not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date hereof and (ii) does not involve
or relate to an Alternative Proposal.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days) after the
date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to
Section 5.4, include the Recommendation, and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments by
the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt thereof,
and shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders promptly following
the time the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company’s stockholders (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days of such time). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such
information concerning themselves and their Affiliates as is customarily included in a proxy statement prepared
in connection with a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise required by Law,
requested by the SEC or its staff or as the Company may reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any written
comments of the SEC staff with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response and consider in good faith such
comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its counsel for inclusion therein.
(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take all action required by
the NYSE and the SEC rules and as required by the DGCL and its articles of incorporation and bylaws to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining (A) the Required Company Stockholder Vote and (B) if so desired and
mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in
connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by such agreement (the
“Company Stockholders’ Meeting”), and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (it being understood that the foregoing shall not require the
Company’s Board of Directors to recommend in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if a Change of
Recommendation has been effected in accordance with Section 5.4). The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, adjourn, recess, postpone or otherwise delay the Company Stockholders’ Meeting;
provided, that (x) the Company may adjourn, recess, or postpone, and at the request of Parent it shall adjourn,
recess or postpone, the Company Stockholders’ Meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional proxies, if
the Company or Parent, respectively, reasonably believes there will be insufficient Shares represented (either
virtually or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders’
Meeting or to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote (provided that, unless agreed in writing by the
Company and Parent, all such adjournments, recesses or postponements shall be for periods of no more than
ten (10) Business Days each) and (y) the Company may adjourn, recess, or postpone the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance
of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor
all Company Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time.
For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (“Company Employees”) (i)
base compensation and annual cash incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were
provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and
employee benefits (excluding transaction bonus payments, defined benefit pension, non-qualified deferred
compensation and retiree medical coverage, but including annual long-term target equity incentive opportunity )
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to Company Employees immediately before the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, (A) Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during
the one (1)-year period following the Effective Time severance benefits equal to the severance benefits that
would have been provided to the Company Employee under the Company’s severance arrangements in effect
immediately prior to the
A-39TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective Time, and (B) during such one (1)-year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered
to each Company Employee shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective
Time in compensation paid or benefits provided to such Company Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compensation and employee benefits for Company Employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be provided in accordance with the applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreement as in effect from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the applicable terms
of any Company Employee Plan, Parent shall not be prohibited by this Section 5.6(a) from terminating the
employment of or changing or modifying the terms and conditions of employment for any Company Employee
following the Closing Date.
(b) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits)
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees
after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New
Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Employee Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old
Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(c) Parent acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the
Company Employee Plans will occur at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.
(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.9, the provisions of this Section 5.6 are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, employee or consultant or any other
person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
an amendment to, or limiting the ability to amend, any Company Employee Plan or other compensation or benefit
plan or arrangement for any purpose. The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use) all reasonable best efforts to take promptly,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the End Date,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Specified Approvals and the Parent Approvals,

as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any

temporary restraining order or injunction entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed
and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required (nor, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall the Company and its Subsidiaries
be permitted) to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration (other than customary
filing and notification fees with Governmental Entities and other nominal amounts) to any third party for any
consent or approval required for or triggered by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any contract or agreement or otherwise.
(b) Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) (i) promptly, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, file or cause to be filed any and all required
notification and report forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and use all reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) supply or cause to be supplied to any Governmental
Entity as promptly as practicable any additional information or documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental Entity and (iii) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do,
or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to
resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities, or any other Governmental Entity or
Person may assert under any Law with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event no later than the End Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license,
hold separate or disposition of any and all of the share capital or other equity voting interest, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines of Parent or its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions
that after the Closing Date would limit Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) or
Affiliates’ freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their Subsidiaries’ (including
the Surviving Corporation’s), assets (whether tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions, operations,
products or product lines, in each case as may be required in order to satisfy the conditions to Closing or to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any Action that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, delaying the Closing in any material
respect or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date (individually or collectively, a “Remedial Action”);
provided, that neither the Company, Parent nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to become
subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order to sell, divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets (whether tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions,
operations, products or product lines of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, unless such
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or
is or becomes effective on or after the Closing; provided further that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.7 or any other provision of this Agreement shall require any
of Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) waive any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 as they apply to Parent
or Merger Sub or (B) agree or otherwise be required to, take any action, including any Remedial Action that,
individually or in the aggregate together with one or more other Remedial Actions, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of the Parent, the
Company, and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and after giving effect to the Merger (it being
understood that, for purposes of determining pursuant to this clause (B) whether such Remedial Action would
reasonably be expected to have such a material adverse effect (aa) Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and after giving effect to the Merger, shall be deemed to be the same size as the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and prior to giving effect to the Merger, and (bb) any proceeds
received, or expected to be received,

from effecting any Remedial Action shall not be taken into consideration). Without limiting Parent’s obligations
under this Section 5.7, in no event shall the Company propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any Remedial Action
without the prior written consent of Parent. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) make, or agree to make,
any acquisition, or knowingly take, or agree to take, any other action outside the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, in each case, that would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the
Closing.
(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
the making of all registrations, filings, notifications, communications, submissions and any other actions
pursuant to this Section 5.7(c), and, subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep
each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by

developing the (i) strategy and timing for obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (or directors or officers of an Acquired Company to the extent serving as
fiduciaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan maintained by any Acquired Company) as provided in
their respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue at and after the Effective Time in full force and effect. For
a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and any of its
Subsidiaries’ articles or certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six (6)-year period. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety
for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.10.
(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or directors or officers of an
Acquired Company to the extent serving as fiduciaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan), in each
case, at or prior to the Effective Time (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators, and
successors and assigns, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest

occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving
as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.
(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’, employment practices
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the
directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and
having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’, employment
practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought)
(with insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’,
employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual
premium most recently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Maximum Amount”). If the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.10(c) because its cost exceeds the
Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-
year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the
Company may, at its option, purchase, or Parent may, at its option cause the Company to purchase, a six-(6) year
prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently
covered by the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such tail to provide coverage in
an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons
than the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the cost of any
such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies
in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred
by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.10 (subject
to the undertakings described in Section 5.10(b)).
(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any
other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.
(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section

Section 7.3(b) against the Parent Related Parties for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the

Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the

(c) Acknowledgements. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are
an integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 7.3(a), Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement and that, without Section 7.3(b), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, respectively, all fees, costs and expenses
of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated by
such party), together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such
payment is required to be made. The parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination Fee nor
the Parent Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is each liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate each party in the circumstances in which either the Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

City of Wilmington, County of New Castle 19808. The name of its registered agent at such address is Corporation
Service Company.

102(b)(7) of the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director or officer of the Corporation shall
not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director or officer. If the DGCL is amended after the effective date hereof to authorize corporate action further
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors or officers, then the liability of a director or officer of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal or
modification of this Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification or with respect
to events occurring prior to such time.
EIGHTH (A) Each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in
any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”),
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such director, officer, employee, or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as such director, officer, employee, or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than the DGCL permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all
expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, other expenses and losses, amounts paid or to
be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of
his or her heirs, executors, and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (B) hereof,
the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article EIGHTH shall be a contract right and shall include the right of a director or
officer to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its
 
Note to Draft: Name to be “[Aquila], Inc.” or such other name as designated by Parent.

final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
while a director or officer including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, which
undertaking shall itself be sufficient without the need for further evaluation of any credit aspects of the undertaking
or with respect to such advancement, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article EIGHTH or otherwise.
(B) If a claim under paragraph (A) of this Article EIGHTH is not paid in full by the Corporation within
sixty (60) days after a written claim, together with reasonable evidence as to the amount of such claim, has been
received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses (including attorneys’
fees), in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and, if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense, including attorneys’ fees, of prosecuting such suit. It shall
be a defense to any such suit, other than a suit brought to enforce a claim for expenses (including attorneys’
fees) incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if
any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation, that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct
that make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed,
but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including the Board or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
suit or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit
brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of
proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification, or to such advancement of expenses, under
this Article EIGHTH or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
(C) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in
advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article EIGHTH shall not be exclusive of any other right that
any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaw,
agreement, or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
(D) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee, or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise against any such expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or loss under the DGCL.
(E) In the case of a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses against the Corporation under
this Article EIGHTH arising out of acts, events, or circumstances for which the claimant, who was at the relevant
time serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent of any other entity at the request of the Corporation, may
