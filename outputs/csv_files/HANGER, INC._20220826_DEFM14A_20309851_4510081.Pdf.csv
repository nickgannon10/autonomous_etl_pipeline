The Special Meeting (page 23)
Date, Time and Place
A special meeting of our stockholders will be held on September 30, 2022 at 10:00 A.M., local time, at The
Westin Austin at The Domain, 11301 Domain Drive, Austin, Texas 78758.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of Hanger common stock at the close of
business on August 24, 2022 (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote at the special meeting for each
share of Hanger common stock you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
Purpose
At the special meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on the following
proposals:
to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger (the “Merger Proposal”);
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at the time of the special meeting (the
“Adjournment Proposal”); and
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger (the “Compensation
Proposal”).
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 39,123,266 shares of Hanger common stock outstanding and entitled to be
voted at the special meeting. A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a special meeting. The holders
of record of a majority in voting power of the shares of outstanding Hanger common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special
meeting. As a result, 19,561,634 shares of Hanger common stock must be represented by proxy or by
stockholders present and entitled to vote at the special meeting to have a quorum. Abstentions will be
counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. Shares held in “street name” for
which the applicable broker, bank or nominee receives no instructions regarding how to vote on any of the
proposals before the special meeting will not be counted as present at the special meeting for quorum
purposes. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting may result in an adjournment of the
special meeting and may subject us to additional expense.
Required Vote
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Hanger common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter as of the Record Date (the
2 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Company Stockholder Approval”). Approval of both the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation
Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Hanger common stock
represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
Stock Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an
aggregate of 1,528,572 shares of Hanger common stock (excluding any shares that would be delivered upon
the vesting, exercise or conversion, as applicable, of Company Options, Company RSUs or Company
PRSUs), representing approximately 3.9% of the outstanding shares of Hanger common stock.
Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of
Hanger common stock: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR”
the Compensation Proposal.
Voting
Any Hanger stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by returning a
signed proxy card by mail, voting via telephone or Internet, or may attend the special meeting and vote in
person. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of Hanger common stock in “street name”
through a broker, bank or nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to
vote your shares of Hanger common stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the discretion to vote your shares
on certain “routine” matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares
with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers,
banks and nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is
important that you instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of Hanger
common stock.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the special meeting by signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us or voting
via telephone or Internet before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day before the special meeting, by providing
written notice of revocation to Thomas E. Hartman, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary,
before your proxy is exercised or by attending the special meeting and voting in person pursuant to the
instructions set forth in “The Special Meeting - Revocability of Proxies” on page 25 of this proxy statement.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank or nominee
for instructions regarding how to change your vote.
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, vote via telephone or Internet or vote
in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal. If you hold your shares of Hanger common stock in “street name,” the failure to instruct your
broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares on any of the proposals will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the
Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. A “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and
nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable stock exchange rules
provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have
discretionary authority to vote on the proposal and have not received specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner of such shares. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the
discretion to vote your shares on certain “routine” matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or
nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. Hanger does not expect any broker non-
votes at the special meeting as the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Broker non-
votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the
outcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the
Compensation Proposal.

Neither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described
in this proxy statement, including the Merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of such transactions, or passed upon
the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.
Expenses of Proxy Solicitation (page 25)
Our board of directors (the “Board”) is soliciting your proxy, and Hanger will bear the cost of soliciting
proxies. We have engaged the services of MacKenzie Partners, Inc. (“MacKenzie”) to solicit proxies for the
special meeting. In connection with its retention, MacKenzie has agreed to provide consulting, analytic and
proxy solicitation services in connection with the special meeting. We have agreed to pay MacKenzie a fee
of approximately $20,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for its services, and we will indemnify
MacKenzie for certain losses arising out of its proxy solicitation services. In addition to the solicitation of
proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, or representatives of
MacKenzie, in person or by telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication, and we
may pay persons holding shares of Hanger common stock on behalf of others their expenses for sending
proxy materials to their principals. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or
employees for their services in connection with solicitation of proxies.
Certain Effects of the Merger on Hanger (page 31)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Hanger, with Hanger continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
As a result of the Merger, Hanger will cease to be a publicly traded company and will cease to be listed on
the NYSE and its shares will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the
surviving corporation and instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in
“The Merger - Merger Consideration” on page 31 of this proxy statement (unless you are entitled to and
have properly demanded appraisal for your shares in accordance with, and have complied in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL, in which case you will be entitled only to those rights granted under Section
262 of the DGCL as described in “The Merger - Appraisal Rights” on page 63 of this proxy statement and
Appendix B to this proxy statement).
The effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date and time as we, Parent and Merger
Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger.
Effect on Hanger if the Merger is Not Completed (page 31)
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the stockholders of Hanger or if the Merger is not completed for
any other reason, you will not receive any payment for your shares of Hanger common stock. Instead, we
will remain a public company, Hanger common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and
registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be entitled to
receive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in
“The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees” on page 97 of this proxy statement.
Merger Consideration (page 75)
At the Effective Time, each share of Hanger common stock issued and outstanding (other than (i) shares
held by Hanger as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Hanger, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) shares of Hanger common stock held by
stockholders who have not voted in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement, including
the Merger, or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal
rights for such shares in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the
“Dissenting Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.75 per share in cash,
without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law (the “Merger
Consideration”). All shares of Hanger common stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
4 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consideration will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and will thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
As described further in “The Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures” on page 76 of this
proxy statement, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a nationally recognized bank or trust
company, reasonably acceptable to Hanger, to act as the paying agent to make payments of the Merger
Consideration to Hanger stockholders (the “Paying Agent”) and deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Following the completion of the
Merger, holders of record of shares of Hanger common stock formerly represented by one or more stock
certificates will provide the Paying Agent with such stockholder’s stock certificates and other items
specified by the Paying Agent, including a letter of transmittal, and the Paying Agent will promptly pay the
stockholder the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled. Stockholders who hold shares
of Hanger common stock in book-entry form (other than shares held through the Depository Trust Company)
will not be required to deliver stock certificates to the Paying Agent, but will be required to deliver an
executed letter of transmittal and other items specified by the Paying Agent to the Paying Agent to receive
the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled. Holders of shares of Hanger common stock in book-
entry form who hold such shares through The Depository Trust Company will not be required to deliver an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled.
After the completion of the Merger, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a Hanger stockholder (except that stockholders who
hold Dissenting Shares will not have the right to receive the Merger Consideration but will instead have the right to
receive a payment for the “fair value” of their Dissenting Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described in “The Merger - Appraisal
Rights” on page 63 of this proxy statement and Appendix B to this proxy statement).
Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards (page 54)
The Merger Agreement provides, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Hanger or any holder of securities of Hanger, for the following treatment with
respect to equity and equity-based awards relating to Hanger common stock:
Stock Options
Each option to purchase shares of Hanger common stock (each, a “Company Option”), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and be
converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax
withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying the
Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of
such Company Option (less any taxes required to be withheld under applicable law). If the exercise price of a
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will be
cancelled for no consideration.
Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Each outstanding award of (i) Hanger restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units or performance-
based restricted stock units, in each case that at such time is subject solely to service-based vesting
conditions (collectively, the “Company RSUs”), will become fully vested and will automatically be cancelled
and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax
withholdings) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of
Company RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and (ii) Hanger performance-based restricted
stock units that at such time is subject to performance-based vesting conditions (collectively, the “Company
PRSUs”) will become vested as to the number of shares of Hanger common stock subject to such award that
would vest based on target level achievement of all performance targets (without application of any modifier)
and will, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof or Hanger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest)
5

TABLE OF CONTENTS
an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to (x) the number of vested shares of Hanger
common stock underlying such award of Company PRSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and
the unvested portion of such Company PRSUs will be cancelled for no consideration.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (page 40)
The Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully reviewing and
considering various factors described in “The Merger - Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and
Reasons for the Merger” on page 40 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined and declared that
the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Hanger and its
stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of Hanger for its adoption and approval and (iv)
recommended that Hanger’s stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (the “Company Board Recommendation”).
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.
Fairness Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc. (page 45)
In connection with the Merger, BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”), Hanger’s financial advisor,
delivered to the Board a written opinion, dated July 21, 2022, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
and as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Hanger common
stock (other than Dissenting Shares). The full text of the written opinion, dated July 21, 2022, of BofA
Securities, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors
considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement and
is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BofA Securities provided its opinion to the Board (in its capacity
as such) for the benefit and use of the Board in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger
Consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger
and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to Hanger or in which Hanger might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of Hanger to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of
the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the
proposed Merger or any other matter.
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger (page 54)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, you should
be aware that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of these interests in,
among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted and approved by the stockholders of Hanger. These interests include the following:
Executive Severance Agreements with Hanger. We have entered into severance agreements with
each of our executive officers which include severance benefits that, upon our termination of the
executive officer’s employment without “cause” or, by each executive officer other than Ms. Adams,
for “good reason”, provide for (i) certain severance payments and (ii) certain reimbursement for
COBRA coverage and other employee benefits, as described in “The Merger - Interests of the
Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger - Severance and Other Termination
Benefits” on page 55 of this proxy statement;
Accelerated Equity Award Vesting. Certain of our directors and executive officers hold equity awards,
the treatment of which is described in “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers
of Hanger in the Merger - Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards” on page 54 of this proxy
statement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Transaction Bonus Pool. Hanger has approved an award pool of $350,000 to be paid in the form of
cash bonuses to certain employees, with individual amounts to be determined by Hanger prior to the
closing of the Merger, as described in “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers
of Hanger in the Merger - Transaction Bonus Pool” on page 57 of this proxy statement;
Indemnification Rights. Our directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and our organizational documents, as well as directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the surviving corporation; and
Compensation Arrangements with Parent. Parent held introductory discussions with certain members
of Hanger’s management team in which Parent indicated that (i) it intends to provide for an equity
pool of up to approximately 12% of the equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates for the granting
of new equity awards to Hanger employees after the closing of the Merger and (ii) it expects members
of Hanger’s management team to use a portion of the proceeds they receive from the Merger to
purchase equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates, on customary terms, each as described in
“The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger - 
Compensation Arrangements with Parent” on page 60 of this proxy statement.
If the Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Merger is completed, any vested shares of
Hanger common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as
outstanding shares of Hanger common stock held by all other stockholders entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration.
These interests are discussed in more detail in “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive
Officers of Hanger in the Merger” on page 54 of this proxy statement.
Financing of the Merger (page 60)
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger, including the funds needed to pay Hanger
stockholders and holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the Merger
Agreement, will be approximately $1.25 billion based upon (i) the consideration payable under the Merger
Agreement, (ii) the repayment and termination of Hanger’s existing credit agreement and (iii) fees,
commissions and expenses in connection with the foregoing, which will be funded through a combination of
the following:
a debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $945 million (the “Debt
Financing” and the commitments therefor, the “Debt Financing Commitments”), consisting of (i)
senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $685 million (comprised of an
initial $550 million first lien term loan facility, a $35 million delayed draw first lien term loan facility and
a $100 million super senior secured revolving credit facility) and (ii) a senior secured second lien term
loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $260 million (comprised of an initial $245 million
second lien term loan facility and a $15 million delayed draw second lien term loan facility), as set
forth in the debt commitment letter related thereto (the “Debt Commitment Letter”); and
a cash equity investment by Patient Square Equity Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership
(“Patient Square Equity”), in an aggregate amount of $410 million (the “Equity Financing” and the
commitments therefor, the “Equity Financing Commitment”), as set forth in the equity commitment
letter related thereto (the “Equity Commitment Letter” and, together with the Debt Commitment
Letter, the “Commitment Letters”).
The funding of the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing (collectively, the “Financing”) is subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter
under which the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing will be provided, respectively. The obligation of
the parties to complete the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. However, the failure of Parent to
obtain the Financing (or to secure alternative financing) would likely result in the failure of the Merger to be
completed. If Hanger terminates the Merger Agreement due to Parent’s failure to complete the Merger when
the closing conditions have been satisfied, subject to the requirements described in the Merger Agreement,
Parent would be obligated to pay to Hanger a $45 million reverse termination fee. See

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the section entitled “The Merger - Financing of the Merger” on page 60 of this proxy statement. For a
description of the circumstances in which the reverse termination fee would be paid to Hanger, see the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees” on page 97 of this proxy statement.
Limited Guaranty (page 62)
To induce Hanger to enter into the Merger Agreement, Patient Square Equity entered into a limited guaranty
in favor of Hanger pursuant to which Patient Square Equity absolutely and irrevocably guaranteed to
Hanger, on the terms and conditions set forth in the limited guaranty, the due, prompt and faithful payment
of (i) the reverse termination fee payable by Parent to Hanger, if and when due in accordance with the
Merger Agreement, (ii) if Parent fails to timely pay the reverse termination fee to Hanger, the obligation to
reimburse Hanger for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the collection of the
reverse termination fee up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate and interest on such unpaid reverse termination fee,
(iii) subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, any monetary damages awarded to Hanger
pursuant to a final and non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of any Willful
and Material Breach (as defined in “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement” on page
95 of this proxy statement) by Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) any reimbursement
and/or indemnification obligations of Parent to Hanger and its subsidiaries and each of their respective
directors, officers and other representatives that may arise pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to
the Debt Financing (collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”); provided, that the maximum amount
payable by Patient Square Equity under the limited guaranty may not exceed $50 million.
Transaction Litigation (page 63)
Following the announcement of the Merger on July 21, 2022, two substantially similar actions have been filed
by purported Hanger stockholders against Hanger and our board of directors, and Hanger has received one
demand letter. On August 9, 2022, a lawsuit styled Stein v. Hanger, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-6775
was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 17, 2022, a
lawsuit styled Singh v. Hanger, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-07023 was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints and demand letter assert similar claims
against Hanger and our board of directors under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The complaints and demand letter allege, among other things, that the
preliminary proxy statement filed August 5, 2022 with the SEC misstated or omitted material information
regarding the financial projections, the financial analyses performed by Hanger’s financial advisor, potential
conflicts of interest of our board of directors and management and the sales process leading up to the
Merger. The complaints seek to enjoin the Merger unless and until the alleged omitted material information is
disclosed, rescission of the Merger Agreement and/or rescissory damages, compensatory damages,
attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs. Hanger believes the lawsuits and the demand letter are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of
or relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed or made in the future, which could prevent or
delay completion of the Merger and result in additional costs to the Company. If additional similar
complaints or demands are filed or made, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company
will not necessarily announce them.
Appraisal Rights (page 63)
If the Merger is approved by our stockholders and becomes effective, holders of Dissenting Shares will be
entitled to statutory appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such
stockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of their Dissenting Shares and to receive payment in cash for the
“fair value” of such Dissenting Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to
be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an appraisal
proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount such holders would have received under the
Merger Agreement. For a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the procedures to
be followed to assert such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of such Dissenting

THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY TRUST
COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF
THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF
RECORD. IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, STOCKHOLDERS WHO MAY
WISH TO PURSUE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD PROMPTLY CONSULT THEIR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL
ADVISORS.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 69)
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined in
“The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger - Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders”
on page 70 of this proxy statement) in exchange for such U.S. holder’s shares of Hanger common stock in the
Merger will generally result in the recognition of taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between the cash such U.S. holder receives in the Merger (including any cash required to be withheld
for tax purposes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted basis in such surrendered shares. Gain or loss will be
determined separately for each block of shares of Hanger common stock (that is, shares acquired for the
same cost in a single transaction). A non-U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger - Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders” on page 71 of this proxy statement)
will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Hanger common stock
for cash in the Merger unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or Hanger
is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. Stockholders should refer to

of this proxy statement, and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences
relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws
of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 72)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), has expired or been
terminated. In addition, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under
Washington Revised Code 19.390.010, et. seq., a statute pertaining to certain health care transactions in the
State of Washington, has expired. Hanger and Parent agreed to make the required filings as promptly as
practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement. Hanger and Parent filed their respective pre-merger HSR
Act notifications on August 2, 2022 with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act. Hanger submitted its HSR Act
notification form to the Washington Attorney General on August 2, 2022.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure
you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the
granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional
conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes
to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Board Recommendation (page 83)
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, we have agreed that we will, and will cause our
subsidiaries and instruct our representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any third party relating to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in “The Merger
Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Board Recommendation” on page 83 of this proxy
statement), request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning Hanger and its
subsidiaries and cease providing any further information with respect to Hanger and its subsidiaries or any
Acquisition Proposal to any such third party or its representatives.
Under the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed that we will not, and will cause
our subsidiaries and instruct our representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
furnish to any third party any non-public information relating to Hanger and its subsidiaries or afford
to any third party access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of Hanger or its subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to
induce, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, the making, submission or announcement
of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal; or
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any third party with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal.
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, as described below, neither the Board nor any
committee thereof will:
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;
withdraw, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation;
approve or cause Hanger to enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement; or
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
We refer to any event in the foregoing first, second, fourth or fifth bullets (to the extent related to one of the
first two bullets) as a “Change of Board Recommendation.”
If, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, we receive a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal from a third party (other than as a result of a breach of the “no solicitation” provisions of the
Merger Agreement) that the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with and advice from its financial advisors and outside counsel) constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Board Recommendation” on page 83 of this proxy statement),
Hanger may subject to the entry into, and solely in accordance with, a confidentiality agreement that
contains confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Hanger than its
confidentiality agreement with Patient Square, furnish to such third party and its representatives any non-
public information relating to Hanger or its subsidiaries or afford to such third party and its representatives
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of Hanger or its subsidiaries and participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with such
third party and its representatives and otherwise facilitate or assist such third party and its representatives
making such Acquisition Proposal. Hanger must provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public
information that is provided to any third party and its representatives given such access that was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable after it is provided
or made available to such third party.
The Board may effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or
terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, only if it has provided Parent at least five
days’ prior written notice of Hanger’s intention to take such action and (i) during the five days, if requested
by Parent, Hanger has engaged in good faith negotiations regarding any amendment to the Merger
Agreement and (ii) the Board will have considered in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed
amendments to the Merger Agreement and will have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the proposed amendments to the Merger Agreement were
to be given effect (as described in “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of
Board Recommendation” on page 83 of this proxy statement). The Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) will not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement for a Superior Proposal unless Hanger pays
the termination fee described in “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees” on page 97 of this proxy
statement.
At any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board may effect a Change of Board
Recommendation if the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that an Intervening Event (as defined in “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Board Recommendation” on page 83 of this proxy statement) has
occurred and is continuing, and that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to
such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements as set forth in the Merger
Agreement (see “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Board
Recommendation” on page 83 of this proxy statement).
For a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of Acquisition Proposals from third parties and the
Board’s ability to make a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger Proposal, see “The
Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Board Recommendation” on page 83 of this
proxy statement.
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 93)
The parties expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, it is possible that factors
outside of each party’s control could require them to complete the Merger at a later time or not to complete it
at all. The following are some of the conditions that must be satisfied or, where permitted by law, waived
before the Merger may be completed:

(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a court of competent jurisdiction or any other
governmental entity;

representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time);

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 95)
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, or such earlier time
specified below, in the following ways (subject to certain limitations and exceptions):
By mutual written consent of Hanger and Parent.
By either Parent or Hanger:
if the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained upon a vote taken at the special meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof;
if any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has
issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, and such order or other action has become
final and non-appealable, or any law has been enacted, entered or enforced that is continuing
and remains in effect and that prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the
Transactions; or
if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before October 19, 2022, which date will be
automatically extended to December 18, 2022, if necessary, to obtain required antitrust approvals
(such date, as may be automatically extended, the “Outside Date”).
By Parent:
at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if (i) the Board has effected a
Change of Board Recommendation or (ii) Hanger has entered into a merger agreement or other
similar agreement relating to a Superior Proposal; or
if (i) Hanger has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in the Merger Agreement such that a condition to the obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub to complete the Merger is not reasonably capable of being satisfied while such breach or
failure to perform is continuing, (ii) Parent has delivered to Hanger written notice of such breach
or failure to perform and (iii) either such breach or failure to perform is not capable of cure in a
manner sufficient to allow satisfaction of the related closing conditions

TABLE OF CONTENTS
prior to the applicable Outside Date or at least 30 days have elapsed since the date of delivery of
such written notice to Hanger and such breach or failure to perform has not been cured in all
material respects.
By Hanger:
at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Board determines to
accept, and Hanger concurrently enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, a Superior
Proposal (if Hanger complied with the “no solicitation” provisions of the Merger Agreement),
provided that Hanger will, prior to or concurrently with such termination, pay the termination fee
to Parent, as described in “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees” on page 97 of this proxy
statement;
if (i) Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in the Merger Agreement such that a condition to the
obligations of Hanger to complete the Merger is not reasonably capable of being satisfied while
such breach or failure to perform is continuing, (ii) Hanger has delivered to Parent written notice
of such breach or failure to perform and (iii) either such breach or failure to perform is not
capable of cure in a manner sufficient to allow satisfaction of the related closing conditions prior
to the applicable Outside Date or at least 30 days have elapsed since the date of delivery of such
written notice to Parent and such breach or failure to perform has not been cured in all material
respects; or
if (i) all the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger have
been satisfied or waived (other than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
closing, but which will then be capable of satisfaction if the closing were to occur on such date),
(ii) Parent fails to consummate the closing of the Merger, (iii) Hanger has delivered an irrevocable
written notice to Parent stating that, if Parent performs its obligations under the Merger
Agreement and the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters are funded, the closing
will occur and (iv) Parent fails to consummate the Transactions within three business days.
Termination Fees (page 97)
Under the Merger Agreement, Hanger may be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $23 million if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, and, Parent may be required to pay to
Hanger a reverse termination fee of $45 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified
circumstances. See “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees” on page 97 of this proxy statement for a
discussion of the circumstances under which either party will be required to pay a termination fee or reverse
termination fee, as applicable. In no event will either Hanger or Parent be required to pay a termination fee or
reverse termination fee, as applicable, more than once.
Specific Performance (page 98)
In addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled, the parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to specific performance as to its terms, and the
parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of
any specific performance or injunctive relief and will waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. Hanger’s or Parent’s pursuit of specific performance will not
preclude the pursuing party from the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled; provided, however, under no circumstances will Hanger or any of its affiliates be permitted or
entitled to seek or receive both a grant of specific performance, on the one hand, and payment of all or a
portion of the Parent reverse termination fee or any other monetary damages from Parent or any of Parent’s
related parties, on the other hand.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hanger will have the right to enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, only if,
(i) all conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger have been satisfied or
waived (other than the conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at closing, all of which
13 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
would be satisfied if the closing of the Merger would occur as of such date ), (ii) Hanger has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, the closing will
occur, (iii) the Debt Financing (or any replacement debt financing) has been funded or will be funded at the
closing of the Merger if the Equity Financing is funded (or in the case any alternative financing, such
alternative financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing if the Equity Financing is funded), and
(iv) Parent has failed to cause the closing of the Merger to occur by the date the closing of the Merger is
required to have occurred.
Fees and Expenses (page 99)
Except in specified circumstances, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses.
Delisting and Deregistration of Hanger Common Stock (page 93)
As promptly as practicable following the completion of the Merger, Hanger common stock will be delisted
from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer be required to file periodic
reports with the SEC on account of Hanger common stock.

If the Merger is approved and becomes effective, holders of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to statutory
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders are entitled to seek
appraisal of their Dissenting Shares and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of such Dissenting
Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less
than, equal to or more than the amount such holders would have received under the Merger Agreement. For
a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the procedures to be followed to assert
such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, see Section 262 of the DGCL,

“strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “potential” or other similar
expressions, or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology. These statements are based on
current beliefs and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors, including,
without limitation:
the inability to consummate the Merger within the anticipated time period, or at all, due to any reason,
including the failure to obtain stockholder approval to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement, the
failure to obtain required regulatory approvals or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the
consummation of the Merger;
the failure by Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the necessary Debt Financing and Equity Financing as
set forth in the Commitment Letters received in connection with the Merger;
the risk that the Merger disrupts Hanger’s current plans and operations or diverts management’s
attention from its ongoing business;
the effect of the announcement of the Merger on Hanger’s operating results and business generally;
the effect of the announcement of the Merger on the ability of Hanger to retain and hire key
personnel and maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and others with whom it does
business;
the risk that Hanger’s stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not consummated;
the nature, cost and outcome of any litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such
proceedings related to the Merger and instituted against Hanger and others;
the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring Hanger to pay a
termination fee of $23 million;
the amount of costs, fees and expenses related to the Merger;
other risks to consummation of the Merger, including the risk that the Merger will not be
consummated within the expected time period or at all; and
other factors that could affect the results of Hanger’s business such as the financial and business
impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers, governmental
and private payers and others in the healthcare industry and beyond, labor shortages and increased
turnover in our employee base, contractual, inflationary and other general cost increases, including
with regard to costs of labor, raw materials and freight, federal laws governing the health care
industry, governmental policies affecting O&P operations, including with respect to reimbursement,
failure to successfully implement a new enterprise resource planning system or other disruptions to
information technology systems, the inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy,
including integration of recently acquired O&P clinics into our existing business, changes in the
demand for our O&P products and services, including additional competition in the O&P services
market, disruptions to our supply chain, our ability to enter into and derive benefits from managed-
care contracts and our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified O&P clinicians.
The foregoing review of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations should

"HANGER, INC._20220826_DEFM14A_20309851_4510081.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger
Agreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every communication among the
Board, representatives of Hanger and other parties.
In the ordinary course, the Board and Hanger management periodically review and assess Hanger’s results
of operations, financial position, business strategy and growth opportunities, as well as the trends and
conditions affecting Hanger’s industry and business generally. Such assessments include periodic meetings
or consultations with third-party advisors, as well as consideration of potential strategic and financial
alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including acquisitions and financing transactions. At regularly
scheduled meetings of the Board, in connection with the Board’s evaluation of Hanger’s business strategy
and growth opportunities, Hanger’s management routinely updates the Board on Hanger’s recent activities
and reviews strategic opportunities and challenges for Hanger in light of current market conditions and
trends. Hanger’s management and certain members of the Board also engage in general discussions from
time to time with various parties, including strategic parties and financial sponsors, as well as financing
sources, market participants and investment banking firms, regarding Hanger’s business, strategy and
growth opportunities, including opportunities for collaboration, potential business combinations,
acquisitions and financing transactions. Among numerous other discussions with financial sponsors and
financing sources, a general discussion occurred in December 2021 between Vinit K. Asar, the President and
Chief Executive Officer of Hanger, and a principal of Patient Square. In addition, BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA
Securities”), Hanger’s longstanding investment banking advisor, has from time to time made presentations
to the Board regarding matters such as market conditions and trends and financing alternatives.
At a regularly scheduled Board meeting held by video conference on February 16, 2022, Hanger management
updated the Board regarding, among other matters, the inflationary environment, including resulting key risk
areas such as the impacts of inflation on material and labor costs. Hanger management also reviewed for the
Board fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results with comparisons to 2020 results, as well as against
Hanger’s budget for 2022, including assumptions regarding inflation and labor costs. Also during the
meeting, at the request of Hanger management, which was discussed in advance with Hanger’s independent
Chairman of the Board, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed Hanger’s recent stock price performance
and market benchmarking, noting that Hanger’s stock price performance had been negatively impacted
relative to its peers due to sales volume, margin, productivity and supply chain issues exacerbated by the
COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in downward impacts on Hanger’s revenues and earnings. BofA Securities
also discussed with the Board certain strategic alternatives for Hanger, including executing on its current
strategic business plan and exploring a sale of Hanger as a potential means to realize value with greater
certainty, with rationales for and considerations regarding both alternatives. BofA Securities also discussed
an illustrative process for exploring a potential sale of Hanger, should the Board determine to initiate such a
process. Hanger’s outside legal advisors, Foley & Lardner LLP (“Foley”), provided an overview of the
Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with the review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale
transaction, and legal matters related to the potential process described by BofA Securities. The Board did
not make a determination to conduct a further evaluation of potential strategic alternatives at that time.
On February 25, 2022, the independent directors on the Board held a video conference without Hanger
management or advisors present to further discuss the matters reviewed at the February 16, 2022 Board
meeting.
At a special Board meeting held by video conference on March 18, 2022, Hanger management reviewed with
the Board a comparison of Hanger’s long range forecast previously presented to the Board in August 2021
to an updated five-year forecast prepared by Hanger management. The five-year forecast prepared by
Hanger management (as updated) and reviewed with the Board is referred to in this proxy
32 TABLE OF CONTENTS
statement as the “Management Forecast”, as discussed under “- Certain Financial Projections” in this
proxy statement. Since the time of the development of the long range forecast, Hanger’s results for 2021 were
significantly affected by the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19, as well as other factors, and results
for 2021 were lower than had been forecasted in the long range plan forecast. Hanger management
incorporated actual 2021 performance into the Management Forecast. Additionally, Hanger had prepared its
budget for 2022 beginning in the fall of 2021, and that process had enabled Hanger management to
incorporate into the Management Forecast updated information regarding Hanger’s business trends,
particularly with respect to reimbursements and inflation. At the request of the Board, representatives of
BofA Securities reviewed Hanger’s recent stock price performance, market benchmarking, the Management
Forecast and certain illustrative valuation metrics for Hanger. BofA Securities again reviewed with the Board,
and the Board discussed, certain strategic alternatives for Hanger. BofA Securities also discussed in detail a
proposed process and timeline for exploring a potential sale of Hanger. BofA Securities reviewed with the
Board a range of potential buyers to be approached in the process. In addition, BofA Securities and members
of Hanger management discussed with the Board the likelihood that any strategic buyers would have both
the financial wherewithal and interest to acquire Hanger and the risks to Hanger of sharing confidential
information with potential strategic buyers before an agreed transaction was in place. As part of such
discussions, representatives of Foley discussed certain matters relating to the proposed process and
reminded the Board of its fiduciary duties in connection with the review of strategic alternatives, including a
potential sale transaction. Based on these discussions, the Board determined that only potential financial
sponsor buyers would be included in the process at this stage. After discussion by the Board of the
proposed sale process (the “Sale Transaction Process”), the directors present unanimously determined to
commence the Sale Transaction Process, and directed Hanger management and BofA Securities to undertake
the initial steps thereof. Hanger management also reviewed with the Board the key terms of a proposed
engagement letter with BofA Securities, noting that the terms had been reviewed by both management and
Foley. In light of BofA Securities’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of Hanger’s business
and industry, the directors present unanimously authorized Hanger management to execute the engagement
letter with BofA Securities on substantially the terms presented.
During the months of March and April 2022, Hanger management and its advisors prepared for the Sale
Transaction Process, including by preparing a presentation for distribution to potential bidders (the “Hanger
presentation”) that included the Management Forecast that was reviewed with the Board at the March 2022
meeting, documents to be uploaded to the virtual data room, and a form of confidentiality agreement to be
furnished to potential bidders.
Beginning on March 31, 2022, BofA Securities initiated discussions with 14 potentially interested parties, all
of which were financial sponsors, regarding whether such parties would have an interest in exploring a
transaction with Hanger. Patient Square and Bidders A through I (as defined below) were included in such
outreach. These discussions were conducted only based upon publicly available information given the
parties had not yet entered into confidentiality agreements. Following this initial outreach, Hanger entered
into confidentiality agreements with 12 potentially interested parties. Patient Square entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Hanger on April 11, 2022. Each party that entered into a confidentiality
agreement received certain process materials from BofA Securities, including the Hanger presentation. The
remaining two parties that did not enter into confidentiality agreements indicated they were not interested in
pursuing a transaction with Hanger for a variety of reasons.
Two of the potentially interested parties who entered into confidentiality agreements with Hanger and
received process materials declined the opportunity to meet for a management presentation. During April
2022, Hanger conducted management presentations with ten potentially interested parties who had
previously entered into confidentiality agreements with Hanger and received process materials, during which
Hanger management provided an overview of Hanger’s business, results of operations, business strategies
and growth opportunities. Three of such management presentations were held virtually and seven were held
in person (or hybrid) at BofA Securities’ offices in New York, New York.
On April 12, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor party (“Bidder A”) participated in a Hanger
management presentation meeting. Following this meeting, BofA Securities had a follow-up telephone
conversation with Bidder A. Bidder A ultimately declined to proceed in the process.

management presentation meeting. Bidder H ultimately did not submit an indication of interest.
On April 22, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor party (“Bidder I”) participated in a Hanger
management presentation meeting. Bidder I ultimately did not submit an indication of interest.
On April 25, 2022, BofA Securities distributed to Patient Square, Bidder B, Bidder C, Bidder D, Bidder E,
Bidder F, Bidder G, Bidder H and Bidder I a process letter requesting non-binding indications of interest from
potentially interested parties by no later than May 12, 2022 and supplemental materials regarding Hanger
growth scenarios.
On May 4, 2022, Hanger publicly released its first quarter of 2022 earnings. On May 4, 2022, BofA Securities
distributed to Patient Square, Bidder C, Bidder D, Bidder E, Bidder F, Bidder G and Bidder H supplemental
materials regarding Hanger’s first quarter of 2022 financial results.
On May 12, 2022, Patient Square was the only potentially interested party to submit a non-binding initial
indication of interest to acquire Hanger. Patient Square proposed an all-cash purchase price of $18.50 per
share, subject to customary conditions, including completing due diligence. In addition, the indications of
interest indicated Patient Square intended to finance the merger consideration with a combination of third-
party debt and equity capital from its own managed funds and that debt financing would not be a condition
to closing. Patient Square also noted its ability to move quickly and that it expected that it could complete its
due diligence and sign definitive transaction documentation in approximately four weeks. No other bidders
submitted an indication of interest.
On May 16, 2022, during a Board update call held by video conference, BofA Securities reviewed with the
Board the status of the Sale Transaction Process, including that outreach had been made to 14 potentially
interested parties, with 12 parties expressing interest in evaluating the opportunity, signing a confidentiality
agreement and receiving a presentation and the Management Forecast, and ten parties receiving an
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
executive presentation with Hanger management. BofA Securities discussed with the Board that as the
deadline to submit non-binding initial indications of interest approached, market conditions had deteriorated
significantly with heightened volatility, broad risk-off investor mentality, rising interest rates, constraints
around availability of financing, growing inflationary pressures, and contraction of valuation multiples. BofA
Securities also noted that a majority of the potential bidders communicated that they were unable to
underwrite the Hanger growth and multiple expansion required to generate expected returns. BofA Securities
reviewed with the Board the terms of the non-binding indication of interest received from Patient Square. A
representative of Foley discussed with the Board certain matters relating to the process conducted,
including fiduciary duty considerations relating to any decision to continue the process. The Board did not
make a decision during the call as to whether to continue with the Sale Transaction Process.
At a regularly scheduled Board meeting held by video conference on May 19, 2022, representatives of BofA
Securities reviewed with the Board Hanger’s recent stock price performance, macroeconomic factors driving
the equity markets, and valuation benchmarking for Hanger. BofA Securities also discussed with the Board
certain illustrative valuation metrics based on the Management Forecast previously provided to the Board,
and also discussed challenges for Hanger in light of current market conditions and trends and their impact
on potential bidders in the process. The Board then met in executive session with only Foley present and
deliberated whether to continue the Sale Transaction Process or to terminate it, including a discussion of
reasons for and against both strategic alternatives. Upon completion of the discussion, the Board
unanimously supported continuing with the next steps of the Sale Transaction Process and directed
management to instruct BofA Securities to advise Patient Square that Patient Square would need to increase
its per share offer price for Hanger to be in the “twenties” for Patient Square to continue in the process.
On May 19, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had telephone conversations with representatives of
Patient Square to communicate that the proposed price of $18.50 per share was inadequate and that Patient
Square would need to increase its per share offer price to be in the “twenties” for Patient Square to continue
in the process. Later that day, Patient Square submitted to BofA Securities a revised non-binding indication
of interest stating that it saw a path to $20.00 per share, subject to validation of certain assumptions that
required access to Hanger management and an in-depth review of Hanger financial and business information
to validate. Subsequently, on May 25, 2022, Patient Square received access to a virtual data room of certain
limited business and financial information.
On May 25, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor party (“Bidder J”) contacted BofA Securities
expressing interest in Hanger and noting they had done outside due diligence work. On May 26, 2022, Bidder
J entered into a confidentiality agreement and was provided with certain process materials from BofA
Securities, including the presentation that included the Management Forecast.
On May 27, 2022, representatives of Patient Square and Hanger management held a phone call during which
Patient Square conducted financial and business due diligence, including a review of the Management
Forecast. Thereafter and into June 2022, Patient Square performed business and operating due diligence. On
June 7, 2022, representatives of Patient Square attended a full day management presentation at Hanger’s
headquarters in Austin, Texas.
On June 10, 2022, Bidder J had a virtual meeting with Hanger management. Bidder J ultimately declined to
proceed in the process.
On June 14, 2022, representatives of Patient Square held a due diligence call with Hanger management on the
Management Forecast and cost structure matters.
On June 17, 2022, on a regularly scheduled monthly Board update video conference, Hanger management
updated the Board on the status of the Sale Transaction Process to explore a potential sale of Hanger.
On June 19, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities held a telephone conversation with representatives of
Patient Square regarding the Sale Transaction Process.
On June 20, 2022, Patient Square submitted a letter to BofA Securities indicating that its time spent with
Hanger management and access to Hanger information helped provide confidence to allow it to pay the price
of $20.00 per share to which it saw a path in its May 19, 2022 indication of interest, but that in the
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
intervening time the debt financing markets had moved materially, reducing the aggregate amount of debt
that could be raised and increasing interest rates and debt issuance costs, resulting in lower expected
returns on equity. As a result, Patient Square reaffirmed its initial valuation of $18.50 per share and noted it
did not have additional flexibility to move on valuation. Patient Square also noted it anticipated completing
remaining confirmatory due diligence and could sign definitive transaction documentation in the next three
weeks.
On June 23, 2022, the Board held an update call by video conference to discuss the letter received from
Patient Square. Representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board that since the May 19, 2022
Board meeting, capital markets conditions had continued to deteriorate and debt financing had become
increasingly more conservative from a leverage multiple standpoint and expensive from the cost of debt and
original issue discount standpoint. Representatives of BofA Securities then reviewed updates to its principal
valuation assumptions since the May 19, 2022 Board presentation due to the change in market conditions
and updated illustrative valuation metrics, including selected publicly traded companies, selected precedent
transactions and discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Management Forecast previously provided to
the Board, which remained unchanged. A representative of Foley discussed with the Board certain fiduciary
duty matters relating to the Sale Transaction Process, including the desire of the Board to include a “go-
shop” period to allow Hanger to solicit proposals after signing of any merger agreement if the Board
determined to continue such process. After deliberation, the Board directed BofA Securities to advise Patient
Square that Patient Square would need to increase its per share offer price for Hanger to $19.25.
On June 23 and 24, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had telephone conversations with
representatives of Patient Square to communicate that the proposed price of $18.50 per share was inadequate
and that Patient Square would need to increase its per share offer price to $19.25. As a result of such
discussions Patient Square orally conveyed to BofA Securities that it was able to improve the proposed price
to $18.75 per share, but that was Patient Square’s best and final offer.
On June 25, 2022, the Board held an update call by video conference to discuss the most recent offer
received from Patient Square. The call began with an executive session of the Board with a representative of
Foley reviewing with the Board certain legal matters relating to the Sale Transaction Process to explore a
potential sale of Hanger, as well as fiduciary duty considerations. Representatives of BofA Securities then
joined the call and reviewed the discussions that had occurred with representatives of Patient Square
resulting in the offer of $18.75 per share. BofA Securities was then excused from the meeting and the Board
engaged in an extended discussion of whether to continue the Sale Transaction Process with Patient Square
at the offered price or to terminate the process, including a discussion of reasons for and against both
strategic alternatives. Upon completion of the discussion, the Board unanimously supported continuing with
the next steps of the Sale Transaction Process, including proceeding with making additional information
available to Patient Square for due diligence and providing to Patient Square an auction draft of a form
merger agreement, the key terms of which from a fiduciary duty perspective representatives of Foley had
discussed with the Board, and directed management to instruct BofA Securities to obtain a confirmation of
Patient Square’s offer of $18.75 per share in writing.
On June 25, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities requested and obtained from Patient Square a letter
confirming Patient Square’s updated indication of interest price of $18.75 per share. Patient Square and its
advisors were subsequently provided access to a full virtual data room of information for due diligence
purposes and a process letter indicating final bids were due on July 19, 2022, with markups of the draft form
of merger agreement and other transaction documents due in advance.
Beginning on June 27, 2022 and into July 2022, Hanger and its advisors engaged in an extensive financial,
legal and regulatory due diligence process with Patient Square and its advisors, including numerous
conference calls on due diligence matters.
On June 28, 2022, Patient Square and its transaction legal counsel, Greenberg Traurig, LLP (“Greenberg”),
were provided auction drafts of a form Merger Agreement and a form Limited Guaranty. Among other terms,
the draft Merger Agreement included a 45-day “go-shop” period to allow Hanger to solicit proposals after
signing the proposed Merger Agreement with Patient Square, a “two-tiered” Hanger termination fee with a
lower termination fee of 1.0% of Hanger’s equity value payable if the Merger Agreement was terminated by
Hanger to accept a superior proposal during the “go-shop” period (as well as
36 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
after the “go-shop” period for certain exempted persons who approached Hanger during the “go-shop”
period) and a termination fee of 3.0% of Hanger’s equity value after the “go-shop” period. The draft Merger
Agreement also contemplated that Parent, Hanger and their respective affiliates would be required to divest
assets, pursue litigation and take certain other actions, if necessary, to obtain antirust and other regulatory
approvals (a so-called “hell or high water” regulatory approvals provision). In addition, the draft Merger
Agreement provided that Parent would be obligated to pay a reverse termination fee of 10.0% of the equity
value of Hanger if the Merger Agreement was terminated due to Parent’s failure to consummate the Merger
when required to do so under the Merger Agreement, due to a willful and material breach of the merger
agreement by Parent or due to a failure of Parent to obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals.
On July 6 and 8, 2022, representatives of Patient Square held due diligence calls with Hanger management
regarding clinician employment, labor and other costs, reimbursement and payor dynamics and other Hanger
business trends.
On July 7, 2022, Foley made available to Greenberg an initial draft of the Disclosure Schedule to the Merger
Agreement. Subsequently, Foley sent Greenberg updated drafts of such Disclosure Schedule on which
Greenberg commented.
On July 8, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Limited Guaranty and
an initial draft of the Equity Commitment Letter. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement removed the “go-
shop” provision, replaced the “two-tiered” structure for Hanger’s termination fee with a “single-tier”
structure and proposed a termination fee of $30 million (approximately 3.9% of Hanger’s equity value), added
a provision that if the Merger Agreement was terminated for failure to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval Hanger must reimburse Parent for its transaction fees and expenses, stated that the “hell or high
water” regulatory efforts provision was subject to due diligence, proposed a Parent reverse termination fee
of $36 million (approximately 4.7% of Hanger’s equity value), and deleted triggers for payment of a Parent
reverse termination fee for willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement and failure to obtain
regulatory approvals.
On July 11, 2022, Foley had a telephone call with Greenberg to provide high-level feedback on the issues
presented by Greenberg’s comments to the draft Merger Agreement. These issues included, among other
things: (i) the Board’s desire to include a “go-shop” provision in the Merger Agreement; (ii) the size and
structure of the Hanger termination fee; (iii) that Hanger would not agree to expense reimbursement for a
failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; (iv) the level of Parent’s efforts to obtain regulatory
approvals; and (v) the size of and triggers for the Parent reverse termination fee.
On July 11 and July 12, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had telephone calls with representatives of
Patient Square to also discuss the Board’s desire to include a “go-shop” provision in the Merger Agreement
and the expected “hell or high water” efforts to obtain regulatory approvals. During such calls,
representatives of Patient Square expressed that Patient Square would not be willing to execute a Merger
Agreement that contained a “go-shop” provision.
On July 12, 2022, representatives of Patient Square met with Hanger’s management team for a half-day
meeting at Hanger’s headquarters in Austin, Texas for purposes of continuing due diligence as well as to
discuss with Hanger’s management Patient Square’s plans for Hanger. During such discussion, Patient
Square had an introductory discussion with certain members of Hanger’s management team in which it
indicated that it may provide for an equity pool of up to approximately 12% of the equity of Parent or one or
more of its affiliates for the granting of new equity awards to Hanger employees after the closing of the
Merger, as described in “- Interests of the Directors and Officers of Hanger in the Merger - Compensation
Arrangements with Parent”.
On July 12, 2022, Foley sent Greenberg revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, the Limited Guaranty and the
Equity Commitment Letter for review and consideration prior to Greenberg submitting a revised draft of the
Merger Agreement in advance of the July 15, 2022 Board call to review terms of the draft Merger Agreement.
The revised draft of the Merger Agreement reinserted the “go-shop” provision and a “two-tiered” Hanger
termination fee of $7.7 million (approximately 1.0% of Hanger’s equity value) if the Merger Agreement was
terminated by Hanger to accept a superior proposal during the “go-shop” period and a
37 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
termination fee of $23 million (approximately 3.0% of Hanger’s equity value) after the “go-shop” period and
deleted the provision requiring Hanger to reimburse Parent for its transaction fees and expenses if the
Merger Agreement was terminated for failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The revised draft
continued to include “hell or high water” regulatory efforts provision, increased the Parent reverse
termination fee to $56 million (approximately 7.3% of Hanger equity value) and reinserted the triggers for
payment of a Parent reverse termination fee for willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement and
failure to obtain regulatory approvals.
On July 13, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities had a telephone call with representatives of Patient
Square to again discuss the Board’s desire to include a “go-shop” provision in the Merger Agreement and
the expected “hell or high water” efforts to obtain regulatory approvals. During such call, representatives of
Patient Square reiterated their position that Patient Square would not be willing to execute a Merger
Agreement that contained a “go-shop” provision, but expected that they could include the “hell or high
water” regulatory efforts provision in the Merger Agreement.
On July 14, 2022, Greenberg had a telephone call with Foley to provide feedback on the open material issues
in the draft Merger Agreement. Among other items, Greenberg noted with respect to the request for a “go-
shop” provision that the “no solicitation” provisions of the Merger Agreement contained customary
“fiduciary out” provisions and that they expected to include the “hell or high water” regulatory efforts
provision in the Merger Agreement with some qualifications. The size of both the Hanger termination fee and
the Parent reverse termination fee were also discussed, along with the triggers for the Parent reverse
termination fee. Greenberg also raised the desire of Patient Square to obtain consents and renewals with
respect to certain third party contracts as a closing condition.
On July 14, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley a revised draft of the Merger Agreement that again removed the “go-
shop” provision but lowered Hanger’s termination fee from Patient Square’s prior position to $28 million
(approximately 3.6% of Hanger’s equity value) and did not include a provision for Hanger reimbursement of
Parent’s transaction fees and expenses if the Merger Agreement was terminated for failure to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. The revised draft also included the “hell or high water” regulatory efforts
provision subject to certain qualifications and deleted the Parent reverse termination fee for failure to obtain
regulatory approvals. In addition, the revised draft increased the Parent reverse termination fee from Patient
Square’s prior position to $39 million (approximately 5.0% of Hanger’s equity value), and deleted the trigger
for payment of a Parent reverse termination fee for willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement, but
instead permitted that in such a situation Hanger has a damages remedy capped at $45 million.
On July 15, 2022, on a regularly scheduled monthly Board update video conference, representatives of Foley
and BofA Securities reviewed with the Board the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the material open
items. With respect to the “go-shop” provision, Foley discussed that such a provision was not required
under Delaware law given 15 potentially interested parties had been engaged during the Sale Transaction
Process and that the Merger Agreement’s “no solicitation” provisions contained customary “fiduciary out”
provisions that would permit the Board to consider acquisition proposals from third parties, including from
any potential strategic buyers, if they constituted or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. BofA Securities also discussed with the Board the likelihood that other financial sponsor bidders
would have different views regarding Hanger than those expressed by potential bidders in the Sale
Transaction Process. Foley discussed that in exchange for eliminating the “go-shop” provision, Hanger
could request a two-tiered termination fee of $10 million (approximately 1.3% of Hanger equity value) for the
first 45 days after signing of the Merger Agreement and $25 million (approximately 3.3% of Hanger equity
value) thereafter. Foley discussed continuing to include the “hell or high water” regulatory efforts provision
in the Merger Agreement without qualification in exchange for eliminating the Parent reverse termination fee
for failure to obtain regulatory approval. With respect to the Parent reverse termination fee and damages cap,
Foley discussed pursuing a reverse termination fee of $50 million (approximately 6.5% of Hanger equity
value) and a damages cap for willful and material breaches by Parent of $55 million. As part of the discussion
on sizes of both the Hanger termination fee and Parent reverse termination fee, Foley reviewed with the
Board data as to the historical median percentages of equity value for such fees. Foley also discussed with
the Board that while the Merger Agreement generally provided for limited conditions to closing, including
that the condition for accuracy of representations was generally subject to a Company
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Material Adverse Effect standard, the request by Patient Square for a closing condition relating to consents
and renewal with respect to certain third party contracts created transaction closing uncertainty, and that
this proposed closing condition should be deleted. The Board instructed Foley to revise the Merger
Agreement consistent with the foregoing.
On July 15, 2022, Foley had a call with Greenberg to discuss the results of the discussion with the Board on
the foregoing merger agreement terms and sent Greenberg a revised draft of the Merger Agreement
consistent with Foley’s instructions from the Board. Also on July 15, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley revised
drafts of the Limited Guaranty and Equity Commitment Letter, which Greenberg and Foley subsequently
finalized.
On July 16, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley a revised draft of the Merger Agreement that deleted the two-tiered
Hanger termination fee but lowered Hanger’s termination fee from Patient Square’s prior position to $23
million (approximately 3.0% of Hanger’s equity value). The revised draft also included the “hell or high
water” regulatory efforts provision without qualification. In addition, the revised draft increased the Parent
reverse termination fee from Patient Square’s prior position to $45 million (approximately 5.9% of Hanger’s
equity value) and increased the damages cap for a willful and material breach by Parent to $50 million. The
revised draft also noted the potential closing condition to obtain consents and renewals with respect to
certain third party contracts would be the subject of a discussion between Hanger management and Patient
Square.
On July 17, 2022, Foley sent Greenberg a revised draft of the Merger Agreement in an effort to resolve minor
open issues, but reserved comment on open issues that had been the subject of the July 15, 2022 Board call
pending further discussion with the Board on those items.
On July 18, 2022, Hanger management and representatives of Patient Square held a call to review Hanger’s
preliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2022 and various matters regarding a proposed Merger,
including the potential closing condition regarding consents and renewals with respect to certain third party
contracts, which Patient Square agreed was not necessary. During such call, Patient Square had an
introductory discussion with certain members of Hanger’s management team in which it indicated that it
expects members of Hanger’s management team to use a portion of the proceeds they receive from the
Merger to purchase equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates, on customary terms, as described in “-
Interests of the Directors and Officers of Hanger in the Merger - Compensation Arrangements with Parent”.
On July 18, 2022, Foley and Greenberg held a call to discuss various items to finalize the draft Merger
Agreement and other transactions documents.
On July 18, 2022, Greenberg sent Foley a revised draft of the Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement.
On July 19, 2022, Hanger management and representatives of Patient Square held a call to review the
Management Forecast.
On July 19, 2022, Greenberg submitted to Foley as Patient Square’s final bid documentation, a revised draft
of the Merger Agreement, which included the $18.75 per share Merger Consideration, revised drafts of the
Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty, a draft of the Debt Commitment Letter and the revised draft
of the Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement.
On July 19, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by video conference, together with Hanger’s management
and financial and legal advisors, to review Patient Square’s final proposal, including the terms of the
proposed Merger Agreement. Foley reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with the Board’s
process to review strategic alternatives, including in connection with a potential sale transaction. BofA
Securities reviewed a summary of the Sale Transaction Process and summarized key financial and other terms
of Patient Square’s bid, which included an all-cash offer at a price of $18.75 per share, including the implied
premiums and multiples that such price represented. BofA Securities also discussed selected terms of the
merger agreement. BofA Securities then reviewed Hanger’s stock price performance, market benchmarking for
Hanger, and updates to BofA Securities’ financial analysis and related assumptions since the June 23, 2022
Board presentation. Hanger management also discussed with the Board Hanger’s

On July 21, 2022, the Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully
reviewing and considering various factors described in “- Reasons for the Merger,” unanimously
40 •

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(i) determined and declared that the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Hanger and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to
which Hanger is a party and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that
the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of Hanger for its adoption
and approval and (iv) recommended that Hanger’s stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board consulted with Hanger’s management and its
financial advisor, BofA Securities, and outside counsel, Foley. The Board carefully reviewed and considered
a number of factors, including the following factors (which are not necessarily listed in order of relative
importance), all of which it viewed as generally supporting its unanimous (i) determination and declaration
that the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Hanger and its
stockholders, (ii) approval of the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) direction that the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of Hanger for its adoption and approval and (iv)
recommendation that Hanger’s stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger:
the fact that the Merger Consideration represents an implied premium of approximately 26% over the
closing price of Hanger common stock of $14.91 on July 20, 2022, the last full trading day before the
Merger Agreement was entered into and announced, an implied premium of approximately 29% over
the 30 calendar day volume-weighted average price ending July 20, 2022, and an implied premium of
approximately 24% over the 90 calendar day volume-weighted average price ending July 20, 2022;
the fact that the Merger Consideration of $18.75 per share will be paid in cash, and provides certainty,
immediate value and liquidity to Hanger’s stockholders, enabling them to realize value for their
interest in Hanger relative to future execution and market risks presented by a challenging
macroeconomic, operating and capital markets environment;
the belief of the Board, based on, among other things, a review of the Company’s business, market
trends, results of operations and financial condition, and discussions with the Company’s
management and its financial and legal advisors, that Hanger stockholders will have limited
opportunities in the future to realize value in the public market for a variety of reasons, including the
fact that the market for Hanger common stock has historically been negatively impacted by low
trading volume, limited investor interest, concentrated stock ownership levels, and lack of attention
from research analysts;
the belief of the Board, after review of Hanger’s business, financial condition, results of operations,
market trends, competitive landscape, execution risks and strategic alternatives, and discussions with
Hanger’s management and financial and legal advisors, that the value offered to Hanger stockholders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement is more favorable to Hanger stockholders than the potential long-
term and sustainable value that might have resulted from remaining an independent public company,
considering:
the view of the Board that the state of the U.S. economy and resulting impact on capital markets,
a higher interest rate environment with tighter lending conditions and lower investor tolerance
for public company leverage present a potentially difficult operating environment for Hanger as a
public company;
uncertainty regarding execution of Hanger’s strategic plan and management projections in light
of the evolving macro-economic environment, including the impact of inflation on reimbursement
rates, the impact of an inflationary environment on controlling costs, and the

impact of tight labor markets on hiring and retention of employees and ultimately clinic
relationships and productivity;
the costs associated with compliance with regulations pertaining to public companies; and
the historical, current and prospective financial condition, results of operations and business of
Hanger;
the strategic alternatives review process undertaken by the Board prior to the signing of the Merger
Agreement, which included outreach to 15 potential private equity bidders as described under “-
Background of the Merger”, and which resulted in Parent’s submission of its final offer of $18.75 per
share;
the belief of the Board, based upon arm’s length negotiations resulting in Parent’s submission of its
final offer of $18.75 per share, that the price to be paid by Parent was the highest price per share that
Parent was willing to pay for Hanger under the then-current facts and circumstances;
the fact that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s length negotiations, as well as the belief
of the Board, based on these negotiations, that these were the most favorable terms to Hanger and its
stockholders on which Parent was willing to agree under the then-current facts and circumstances;
the business reputation and capabilities of Patient Square and its management, and the ability of
Patient Square to complete the Merger;
the belief that Parent had access to the resources needed to complete the Merger, including having
obtained the Debt Financing Commitments for the transactions from a reputable financial institution
and the Equity Financing Commitment from Patient Square Equity, and that Parent had agreed to use
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing in accordance
with their respective terms;
the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based upon, among other things, the limited
number of conditions to the Merger, the absence of a financing condition, the likelihood of obtaining
required regulatory approvals and contractual commitments by Parent to use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain such regulatory approvals and the remedies available under the Merger Agreement
to Hanger in the event of any breaches by Parent;
the opinion provided by BofA Securities, dated July 21, 2022, to the Board as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be received
by holders of Hanger common stock (other than Dissenting Shares), as more fully described in the
section entitled “-",48,53
"HANGER, INC._20220826_DEFM14A_20309851_4510081.Pdf","Fairness Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.","Fairness Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.
Hanger has retained BofA Securities to act as Hanger’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger.
BofA Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for corporate and other purposes. Hanger selected BofA Securities to act as Hanger’s financial advisor in
connection with the Merger on the basis of BofA Securities’ experience in transactions similar to the Merger,
its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with Hanger and its business.
On July 21, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the Merger, BofA Securities delivered to the
Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 21, 2022, to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations
described in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Hanger common stock (other
than Dissenting Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the Board, which describes, among other things, the assumptions
made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Appendix C to
this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA
Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Securities delivered its
opinion to the Board for the benefit and use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of
its evaluation of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address
any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in
comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Hanger or in which Hanger might engage or
as to the underlying business decision of Hanger to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does
not address any other aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to
vote or act in connection with the proposed Merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities has, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Hanger;
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of Hanger furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of
Hanger, including the Management Forecasts;
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Hanger
with members of senior management of Hanger;
reviewed the trading history for Hanger common stock and a comparison of that trading history with
the trading histories of other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
compared certain financial and stock market information of Hanger with similar information of other
companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
other transactions BofA Securities deemed relevant;
considered the results of BofA Securities’ efforts on behalf of Hanger to solicit, at the direction of
Hanger, indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible
acquisition of Hanger;
reviewed a draft, dated July 21, 2022, of the merger agreement, referred to in this section of the proxy
statement as the “Draft Agreement”; and
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as
BofA Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to
or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and BofA Securities relied upon the assurances
of the management of Hanger that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Management
Forecasts, BofA Securities was advised by Hanger, and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of
Hanger as to the future financial performance of Hanger. BofA Securities did not make and was not provided
with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Hanger,
nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Hanger. BofA Securities did not
evaluate the solvency or fair value of Hanger, Parent or any other entity under any state, federal or other
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of
Hanger, that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay,
limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications,
would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Hanger or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of Hanger, that the final executed merger agreement would not
differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger
(other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement
or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Securities’
opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received
by the holders of Hanger common stock (other than Dissenting Shares) and no opinion or view was
expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was
expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of
any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such
persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed
as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be
available to Hanger or in which Hanger might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Hanger to
proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and
relied, with Hanger’s consent, upon the assessments of Hanger and its representatives regarding, legal,
regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Hanger or the Merger (including the contemplated
benefits thereof), as to which matters BofA Securities understood that Hanger had obtained such advice as
Hanger deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or
recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other
matter. Except as described in this summary, Hanger imposed no other limitations on the investigations made
or procedures followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other
conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of,
the date of its opinion. BofA Securities noted that the credit, financial and stock markets had been
experiencing unusual volatility and BofA Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects
of such volatility on Hanger, Parent or the Merger. It should be understood that subsequent developments
may affect its opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of
BofA Securities.
The discussions set forth below in the section entitled “- Hanger Financial Analyses” represents a brief
summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board in connection with its
opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by BofA
Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.

adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, not burdened by stock-based
compensation, referred to as Adjusted EBITDA, as set forth in the table below. Estimated financial data of
the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and

The median Enterprise Value / fiscal year 2022 estimated Adjusted EBITDA multiple observed for the
outsourced physician services companies, which include Surgery Partners, Inc., Acadia Healthcare
Company, Inc., Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. and DaVita Inc., was 12.3x. The median Enterprise Value / fiscal
year 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA observed for such companies was 11.3x.
The median Enterprise Value / fiscal year 2022 estimated Adjusted EBITDA multiple observed for the post-
acute care and rehabilitation services companies, which include ATI Physical Therapy, Inc., U.S. Physical
Therapy, Inc., The Pennant Group, Inc., The Ensign Group, Inc., Encompass Health Corporation and Select
Medical Holdings Corporation, was 11.5x. The median Enterprise Value / fiscal year 2023 estimated Adjusted
EBITDA observed for such companies was 10.0x.
The overall low to high Enterprise Value / fiscal year 2022 and 2023 Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for
all of the selected publicly traded companies were 8.2x to 23.9x and 7.1x to 20.3x, respectively.
Based on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied fiscal year 2022 and 2023
EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 10.5x and 7.0x to 9.5x, respectively, derived from the selected publicly traded
companies, to Hanger’s fiscal year 2022 and 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $137 million and $149 million,
respectively, as set forth in the Management Forecasts, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values for
Hanger.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share value reference ranges for Hanger,
rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the Merger Consideration:

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Hanger. Accordingly, an evaluation
of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Hanger was compared.

BofA Securities reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target
company based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target
company’s latest 12 months (“LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA. The overall low to high transaction value / LTM
Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 8.9x to 18.2x (with a mean of 11.4x
and a median of 11.0x). Based on its professional judgment and experience and after taking into
consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected precedent transactions, BofA
Securities then applied a selected range of transaction value / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 9.5x to
11.5x. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at
the time of announcement of the relevant transaction, and estimated financial data of Hanger were based on
the Management Forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share value
reference ranges for Hanger, rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the Merger Consideration:

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Hanger or
the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather,
this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies,
business segments or transactions to which Hanger and the Merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Hanger to calculate the estimated present
value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Hanger was forecasted to generate during
Hanger’s fiscal year 2022 (second through fourth quarters) through fiscal year 2026 based on the
Management Forecasts. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for Hanger by applying terminal forward
multiples of 8.5x to 10.5x, based on the historical trading range for the Hanger stock as a multiple of Adjusted
EBITDA, to the terminal year Adjusted EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to
present value as of March 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 9.25%, which were based on
an estimate of Hanger’s weighted average cost of capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate
implied per share value reference ranges for Hanger, rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the Merger
Consideration:

Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’
material financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes,
including, among other things, the following:
historical trading prices and trading volumes of Hanger common stock, which indicated low and high
closing prices for Hanger common stock during the 52-week period ended July 20, 2022 of
approximately $13.77 to $25.44; and
one-year future stock price targets for Hanger common stock in the two publicly available research
analyst reports, which were last updated on December 14, 2021 and February 8, 2022, prior to the
announcement of the Merger, and which indicated stock price targets for Hanger, discounted to
present value utilizing Hanger’s cost of equity of approximately 10%, of a range of $21.75 to $25.50.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “- Hanger Financial Analyses”
represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board in
connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or the factors
considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and,
therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA
Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities
further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’
analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not
meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the
summary.
50 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Hanger. The estimates of the future
performance of Hanger in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or
those suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA
Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were
provided to the Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at
which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in,
and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual values of Hanger.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between
Hanger and Parent, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The decision to
enter into the Merger agreement was solely that of the Board. As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion
and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the proposed
Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or Hanger’s management with
respect to the Merger or the Merger Consideration.
Hanger has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee of
approximately $14 million, $1 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion and the remaining
portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Hanger also has agreed to reimburse
BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify
BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in
securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and
principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment
management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide
range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA
Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that
invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in
equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other
obligations) of (i) Hanger and certain of its affiliates, and (ii) Parent and certain of its affiliates, including
Patient Square and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may
provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Hanger and certain of its
affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services,
including (i) having acted or acting as an administrative agent, collateral agent, arranger, book-running
manager and/or bookrunner for, and/or as a lender under, certain letters of credit, credit and leasing facilities
and other credit arrangements of Hanger and/or certain of its affiliates, (ii) having provided or providing
certain foreign exchange trading services to Hanger and/or certain of its affiliates, and (iii) having provided
or providing certain treasury management products and services to Hanger and/or certain of its affiliates.
From July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from
Hanger and certain of its affiliates of approximately $6 million for investment and corporate banking services.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the
future may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Parent and
certain of its affiliates, including Patient Square and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, and have
received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having
acted or acting as an arranger and/or bookrunner for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans, credit
facilities and other credit arrangements of Parent and/or certain of its affiliates, including Patient Square
Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies (including acquisition financing), and (ii)
having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Parent and/or certain of

Except for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal year issued in connection with its ordinary
course earnings announcements, Hanger does not normally publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to
future performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying
assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer-term periods. In connection with the
evaluation of the Merger, Hanger’s management prepared and provided to the Board and BofA Securities the
Management Forecasts. Hanger is including a summary of the Management Forecasts to provide Company
stockholders with access to information that was made available to the Board in connection with its
evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Consideration. In addition, a summary of the Management
Forecasts was made available to Parent and Merger Sub at Parent’s request in connection with their due
diligence review of Hanger. The Management Forecasts were also made available to BofA Securities in
connection with the rendering of its financial fairness opinion to the Board, as more fully described in
“-​Fairness Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.” The summary of the Management Forecasts may not be
appropriate for other purposes and is not being included in this proxy statement to influence a Company
stockholder’s decision whether to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or any other proposal. Please read
the information set forth in this section below under the heading “Important Information Regarding the
Management Forecasts.”

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as operating income before
depreciation and amortization, and adjusted to exclude expenses associated with stock based
compensation, severance expenses, certain expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions
(including the Merger and the Merger Agreement) and certain other charges.
Unlevered Free Cash Flow, as derived from the Management Forecast, means (a) Adjusted EBITDA less
stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization, all tax effected, plus (b) depreciation and
amortization, less (c) changes in net working capital, acquisition expenditures and capital expenditures.
The amounts presented for 2022 reflect the nine-month period ending December 31, 2022. All other years
presented reflect full twelve-month periods.
Important Information Regarding the Management Forecasts
The Management Forecasts were developed by Hanger’s management on a standalone basis without giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the
Management Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
Although the Management Forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous
variables and assumptions made by Hanger’s management with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to Hanger’s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which
are beyond Hanger’s control. The Management Forecasts constitute forward-looking information and are
subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
forecasted in the Management Forecasts, including, but not limited to, the
52 
(3)
(1)
(2)TABLE OF CONTENTS
factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and the various risks
set forth in Hanger’s reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Management Forecasts
will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the Management Forecasts.
The Management Forecasts cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable
with each successive year. In addition, the Management Forecasts will be affected by Hanger’s ability to
achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Management Forecasts
reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be
considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The
inclusion of the Management Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that Hanger, BofA
Securities, their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who
received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and
this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Forecasts in this proxy
statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management Forecasts will be necessarily
predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by Hanger or any other person regarding the
Management Forecasts or Hanger’s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Management
Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information about Hanger contained in Hanger’s public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” In light of the
foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts, Company stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Forecasts.
The Management Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants with respect to the preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The
Management Forecasts included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility
of, Hanger’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor
applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Forecasts and, accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates
to Hanger’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Management Forecasts and
should not be read to do so.
Adjusted EBITDA contained in the Management Forecasts and Unlevered Free Cash Flow derived
therefrom, both as summarized above, are each a “non-GAAP financial measure,” which is a financial
performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures
used in the Management Forecasts were relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion and by
the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a
reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP
financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger
if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-
GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion or by the
Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Hanger has not provided a reconciliation
of the financial measures included in the Management Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial
information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Hanger may
not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations
inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be
included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered
together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The summary of such information above is included solely to give Company stockholders access to the
information that was made available to the Board, BofA Securities, Parent and Merger Sub, and is not
included in this proxy statement to influence any Company stockholder to vote their shares of Hanger
common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal or any other proposal contained herein. In addition, the
Management Forecasts have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, you should
be aware that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder generally. The Board was aware of these
interests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be adopted and approved by
the stockholders of Hanger. See “- Background of the Merger” and “- Recommendation of Our Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger”. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to
vote “FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal.
These interests are described in more detail below. For purposes of the discussion below, Vinit K. Asar,
Thomas E. Kiraly, Peter A. Stoy, Thomas E. Hartman, C. Scott Ranson, James H. Campbell, Mitchell D.
Dobson, Keri L. Jolly, and Gabrielle B. Adams are referred to as the “executive officers.” In certain instances,
Messrs. Asar, Kiraly, Stoy, Hartman and Ranson are referred to as the “named executive officers” as they
were Hanger’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the three other most highly compensated
executive officers, respectively, as determined for purposes of Hanger’s most recent annual proxy statement.
Compensation that may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger is
subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of the stockholders of Hanger and is quantified in the narrative
below and in “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation”. The
dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not
necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.
Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards
Under the Merger Agreement, the equity-based awards held by Hanger’s directors and executive officers
under the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Hanger, Inc. 2016 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, the Hanger, Inc. 2017 Special Equity Plan, the Hanger, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and
the Hanger, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (together, the “Equity Incentive Plans”), will not be continued
following the Merger and therefore will be cancelled and treated as explained below at the Effective Time.
Stock Options
Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will automatically be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount
in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of
Hanger common stock underlying the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option (less any taxes required to be withheld under
applicable law). If the exercise price of a Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, then such Company Option will be cancelled for no consideration.
Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Each outstanding award of Company RSUs will become fully vested and will automatically be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax
withholdings) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of
Company RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. Each outstanding award of Company PRSUs will
become vested as to the number of shares of Hanger common stock subject to such award that would vest
based on target level achievement of all performance targets (without application of any modifier) and will,
after giving effect to such vesting, automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to (x) the number of
vested shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of Company PRSUs, multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration, and the unvested portion of such Company PRSUs will be cancelled for no
consideration.

Severance and Other Termination Benefits
We have entered into executive employment agreements with each of our executive officers which include
severance benefits, and which would continue to apply following the change in control unless the Parent
(1)
severance benefits, and which would continue to apply following the change in control unless the Parent
negotiates otherwise with each executive.
Specifically, the agreements provide that if the executive officer is terminated by Hanger without “cause” or,
for each executive officer other than Ms. Adams, by the executive for “good reason,” in either case within
two years following a change in control of Hanger (such as the Merger), then the executive officer will be
entitled to (i) severance payments equal to the executive officer’s base salary plus target bonus multiplied by
a factor (which is equal to 2.5 for Mr. Asar; 2.0 for Messrs. Kiraly, Stoy, and Ranson; 1.5 for Mr. Hartman and
Ms. Jolly; 1.0 for Mr. Campbell and Mr. Dobson; and 0.5 for Ms. Adams), (ii) reimbursement for COBRA
coverage and other employee benefits for a period of time following termination (30 months for Mr. Asar; 24
months for Messrs. Kiraly, Stoy and Ranson; 18 months for Mr. Hartman and Ms. Jolly; 12 months for Mr.
Campbell and Mr. Dobson; and six months for Ms. Adams), (iii) a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of
termination, if earned based on the achievement of the relevant goals, and (iv) outplacement services.
55 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The foregoing amounts are in addition to the payment of all unpaid base salary to which the executive officer
is entitled through the termination date and other vested benefits to which the executive officer is entitled
under Hanger’s benefit plans and arrangements.
The employment agreements contain a “Section 280G better-of” provision, which provides that, if the total
compensation paid to an executive officer in connection with the Merger, which may include the severance
payments described above, would exceed the applicable threshold under Section 280G of the Code, such that
the executive officer would be subject to an excise tax (and Hanger would forego a tax deduction) on a
portion of those change in control payments, then those payments will either (i) be reduced to avoid the
imposition of the excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, or (ii) paid in full (resulting in the executive
becoming subject to the excise tax and resulting in a loss of a tax deduction for Hanger), whichever of (i) or
(ii) results in a better after-tax result for the executive officer.
“Cause” is generally defined to mean (i) the repeated failure or refusal of the executive to follow the lawful
directives of the Chief Executive Officer of Hanger or the Board (except due to sickness, injury or
disabilities), (ii) gross inattention to duty or any other willful, reckless or grossly negligent act (or omission
to act) by the executive, which materially injures Hanger, including the repeated failure to follow the written
policies and procedures of Hanger, (iii) the executive’s material breach of the employment agreement after
written notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, if curable, or (iv) the commission by the executive of a
felony or other crime involving moral turpitude or an act of financial dishonesty against Hanger or any of its
affiliates. Any determination of “cause” following a change in control (such as the Merger) can only be made
by the Board or by the board of directors of the successor or acquirer in the change in control, which may
terminate the executive for cause only after providing the executive (a) written notice that indicates in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances alleged to provide a basis for such termination, (b) a 30 day
opportunity to cure such facts or circumstances, if curable, (c) the opportunity to appear before such board
(with the accompaniment of counsel) and provide rebuttal to such proposed termination, and (d) written
notice following such appearance confirming such termination and certifying that the decision to terminate
the executive for cause was approved in good faith by at least 66% of the members of such board.
“Good Reason” is generally defined to mean (i) a material diminution of the executive officer’s
responsibilities, (ii) a change to the location of the executive officer’s principal place of employment to a
place that is 50 or more miles away from the executive officer’s current place of employment (unless the
change is no farther from the executive officer’s current residence than the prior location), or Hanger’s failure
to provide at least 60 days’ notice of its intent to relocate the executive officer, or (iii) Hanger’s material
breach of the employment agreement.
In addition, certain of the executive officers may become entitled to additional benefits under Hanger’s
supplemental executive retirement plans in connection with the Merger. Specifically, Mr. Asar and Mr.
Hartman would be entitled to an additional benefit accrual under Hanger’s Defined Benefit Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan if they are terminated without cause or for good reason equal to the benefit they
would have accrued if they had remained employed for the length of their severance period (30 months for
Mr. Asar, and 18 months for Mr. Hartman), and all participants in Hanger’s Defined Contribution
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan who are not yet vested in their benefit (which include Mr. Stoy, Mr.
Dobson and Ms. Jolly) would become fully vested if terminated without cause or with good reason following
the Merger.
Funding of Rabbi Trust
Mr. Asar and Mr. Hartman both participate in Hanger’s Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan, which provides benefit payments for 15 years following the executive’s retirement. The Defined Benefit
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan is an “unfunded plan,” meaning that benefits are generally paid out
of Hanger’s general assets when due. However, pursuant to the terms of the Defined Benefit Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan, no later than 30 days after a change in control, Hanger is required to establish and
fund a “rabbi trust” with assets equal to the present value of the accrued benefits of all participants in the
plan, and make periodic contributions to the trust so that trust assets remain adequate to pay benefit
amounts. As required by applicable tax laws, however, the trust assets continue to be subject to the claims of
creditors in the event of insolvency.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Transaction Bonus Pool
Hanger has approved a $350,000 transaction bonus pool to be paid in the form of cash bonuses to certain
employees in connection with their efforts with respect to the Merger if such employees remain employed by
Hanger through the closing of the Merger, with individual amounts to be determined by Hanger prior to the
closing of the Merger. Hanger has agreed that it will not allocate an amount from the bonus pool to any of
the named executive officers.
Continuing Employees
Under the Merger Agreement, from the Effective Time until the first anniversary thereof, Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to provide to each employee of Hanger and any of its subsidiaries who, as of the
closing of the Merger, continues to be employed with Hanger or any of its subsidiaries (a “Continuing
Employee”), during any period of employment during such twelve month period, base compensation and a
target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less favorable than the base compensation and target
annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and other compensation and benefits (excluding equity award compensation, defined benefit pensions,
nonqualified deferred compensation and change-in-control compensation or benefits) that are substantially
equivalent in aggregate economic value to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement further provides that the surviving
corporation will continue all existing annual bonus plans and commission plans and arrangements through
the end of 2022 without change.
With respect to benefit plans maintained by the surviving corporation (including any vacation, paid time-off
and severance plans, but excluding any defined benefit pension plans), the Continuing Employees will be
given service credit for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting
and benefit accruals under such benefit plans, for their length of service with (or otherwise recognized by)
Hanger or any of its subsidiaries, as reflected in Hanger’s records, except that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table provides information about certain compensation for each of our named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. The values in this table assumes that the Merger
closed on July 31, 2022, that the employment agreements described above remain in effect, and that each
named executive officer was terminated from employment immediately after the closing of the Merger without
cause or for good reason. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below is subject to a
non-binding, advisory vote of Hanger’s stockholders, as described in “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on
Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation”.
The footnotes to the table identify whether the benefit is “single-trigger”  (meaning the benefit is payable
solely as a result of the consummation of the Merger, and is not conditioned on a termination of the named
executive officer’s employment) or “double trigger”  (meaning a benefit that is only payable upon the named
executive officer’s termination of employment without cause or for good reason following the Merger).

that are payable under the terms of the executive employment agreements if the named executive
officer’s employment is terminated without cause or for good reason within two years after the Merger,
as described above under the heading “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of
Hanger in the Merger - Severance and Other Termination Benefits”, and (ii) a pro-rata annual bonus for

This represents the cash value that will be paid with respect to the Company RSUs and Company
PRSUs that will vest on an accelerated basis in connection with the Merger, as described above under
the heading “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger - 
Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards”. This is a “single-trigger” benefit. The value is
calculated by multiplying the total number of Company RSUs and Company PRSUs being vested by
$18.75 per share of Hanger common stock (i.e., the Merger Consideration). The number of Company
RSUs and Company PRSUs for which vesting will accelerate for each named executive officer can be
found above in the chart included above under the heading “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and
Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger - Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards -​Estimated
Value of Accelerated Equity”.
All amounts shown in this column are “double trigger” benefits. For Mr. Asar and Mr. Hartman, this
represents the present value of the additional benefit which would accrue under the Defined Benefit
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan if either of them are terminated by Hanger without cause or by
the executive for good reason, in either case within two years following the Merger. Such additional
benefit is equal to additional credited service under the Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan for the duration of any severance period (30 months for Mr. Asar, and 18 months for Mr.
Hartman). For Mr. Stoy, this represents the balance of his Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan account (determined as of July 31, 2022) which would vest in full if he is terminated at
any time following a change in control (such as the Merger) either by Hanger without cause or by him
for good reason. The Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan benefit otherwise
vests following five years of employment. Mr. Kiraly and Mr. Ranson also participate in the Defined
Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, but their accounts are already fully vested and
thus no additional benefit will be paid or accrue in connection with the Merger.
Amounts in this column are “double-trigger” benefits that will only be paid if the executive is terminated
by Hanger without cause or resigns for good reason within two years following the Merger. The
amounts shown in this column include continued group medical, dental and life and disability coverage,
for a period of 30 months in the case of Mr. Asar, 24 months for Messrs. Kiraly, Stoy and Ranson, and
18 months for Mr. Hartman, plus continued Hanger contributions to the 401(k) plan for the length of the
insurance continuation, plus continuation of the executive’s monthly automobile allowance over the
same period (other than for Mr. Stoy), plus the estimated cost of outplacement services for 18 months
(24 months for Mr. Asar). The estimated value of each of such benefits are set forth below:

“The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger”.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Under the Merger Agreement, beginning at the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the surviving
corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and will advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest
extent permitted under (i) applicable law and (ii) Hanger’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organizational documents in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, each present and former director
and officer of Hanger and its subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary
of a Hanger benefit plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity) against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions.
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors or officers of Hanger or any of its subsidiaries
serving in such capacity at or prior to the Effective Time and each of their respective employees who serves
as a fiduciary of a Hanger benefit plan as provided in its certificates of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. For a period of no less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to, and the surviving corporation will, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable party’s certificate of
incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement of Hanger or its subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect
as of the date of the Merger Agreement, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before
the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of Hanger or its subsidiaries;
provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of
any proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period will continue until the final
disposition of such proceeding; provided, however that the advancement and payment of such expenses
incurred by an indemnified party in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding will be made, unless
otherwise agreed by the surviving corporation, only upon delivery to the surviving corporation of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified party to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it is
ultimately determined as set forth in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the surviving corporation will be jointly and
severally responsible for maintaining for the benefit of the directors and officers of Hanger, as of the date of
the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the Merger, an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of Hanger, or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence will be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid “tail” policies have been
59 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
obtained by Parent or the surviving corporation on or prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been
committed by such directors and officers in coverage and amount no greater than the policies currently in
place so long as the total premiums paid would not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid for
Hanger’s directors and officers liability insurance policies in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, it
being understood that if the total premium payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent or the surviving corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal
to such amount.
In the event that, during the six year period after the Effective Time, either Parent or the surviving
corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent will,
and will cause the surviving corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to cause proper provisions to be
made so that such successor or assign will expressly assume the obligations set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
Compensation Arrangements with Parent
Parent held introductory discussions with certain members of Hanger’s management team in which Parent
indicated it intends to provide for an equity pool of up to approximately 12% of the equity of Parent or one
or more of its affiliates for the granting of new equity awards to Hanger employees after the closing of the
Merger, but there have not been any discussions regarding the amount of any such equity awards to be
granted to any particular Hanger employee, including Hanger’s executive officers. Parent also indicated in
such discussions that it expects members of Hanger’s management team to use a portion of the proceeds
they receive from the Merger to purchase equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates, on customary
terms. Following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Parent continued such introductory
discussions with Hanger’s management team, including regarding continued employment after the closing of
the Merger and potential terms of employment agreements, as well as a possible opportunity for Hanger’s
executive officers and other senior employees to purchase or otherwise participate in the equity of Parent or
one or more of its affiliates, on customary terms. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Hanger’s
executive officers or other senior employees has entered into any agreement with respect to the foregoing,
and there can be no assurances that any such agreements or arrangements will be entered into with any
executive officers in the future. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, some or all of
Hanger’s executive officers or other senior employees may enter into agreements with Parent or any of its
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or
more of its affiliates. If Parent or any of its affiliates and Hanger’s executive officers do not enter into
agreements regarding employment with Parent or one or more of its affiliates, then Hanger’s executive
officers will remain subject to their existing employment agreements with Hanger.",62,68
"HANGER, INC._20220826_DEFM14A_20309851_4510081.Pdf",Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger, including the funds needed to pay Hanger
stockholders and holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the Merger
Agreement, will be approximately $1.25 billion based upon (i) the consideration payable under the Merger
Agreement, (ii) the repayment and termination of Hanger’s existing credit agreement and (iii) fees,
commissions and expenses in connection with the foregoing, which will be funded through a combination of
the following:
Debt Financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $945 million, consisting of (i)
senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $685 million (comprised of an
initial $550 million first lien term loan facility, a $35 million delayed draw first lien term loan facility and
a $100 million super senior secured revolving credit facility) and (ii) a senior secured second lien term
loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $260 million (comprised of an initial $245 million
second lien term loan facility and a $15 million delayed draw second lien term loan facility); and
60 • 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Equity Financing by Patient Square Equity in an aggregate amount of $410 million.
The funding of the Financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letters under which the Financing will be provided, respectively. The obligation of the parties to complete
the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. However, the failure of Parent to obtain the Financing (or
to secure alternative financing) would likely result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. If Hanger
terminates the Merger Agreement due to Parent’s failure to complete the Merger when the closing conditions
have been satisfied, subject to the requirements described in the Merger Agreement, Parent would be
obligated to pay to Hanger a $45 million reverse termination fee. For a description of the circumstances in
which the reverse termination fee would be paid to Hanger, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Termination Fees”.
Debt Financing
Merger Sub, an affiliate of Patient Square, entered into a Debt Commitment Letter, dated as of July 21, 2022,
with Ares Capital Management LLC (together with such other lenders that become party thereto, the “Debt
Commitment Parties”). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Commitment Parties have committed to arrange and syndicate senior secured credit facilities and a senior
secured second lien term facility in an aggregate amount of up to $945 million, consisting of (i) senior
secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $685 million (comprised of an initial $550
million first lien term loan facility, a $35 million delayed draw first lien term loan facility and a $100 million
super senior secured revolving credit facility) and (ii) a senior secured second lien term loan facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $260 million (comprised of an initial $245 million second lien term loan facility
and a $15 million delayed draw second lien term loan facility). The Debt Financing will be used to, among
other things, (i) pay the consideration payable under the Merger Agreement, (ii) repay and terminate
Hanger’s existing credit agreement, (iii) pay fees, commissions and expenses in connection with the
foregoing and (iv) for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. The Debt Commitment
Letter and the commitments thereunder will automatically terminate in the event that the closing of the
Merger and the satisfaction of the conditions under the Debt Commitment Letter does not occur on or before
the earliest of (i) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five business days after the Extended
Outside Date, (ii) the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement by Merger Sub or with Merger Sub’s
written consent, in each case, prior to the closing of the Merger and (iii) the date of the closing of the Merger
without the use of the Debt Financing.
The availability of the Debt Financing is subject to conditions precedent, customary for financings of
transactions comparable to the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to satisfy all such conditions precedent and to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter in the event of a Financing Failure Event. Parent has also agreed not to permit any
amendment, replacement, modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless an equal amount from alternative financing
sources is then made available), impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand any conditions
that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the closing of the Merger, make the funding of the
Debt Financing materially less likely to occur or materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the Debt Commitment Parties.
If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, Parent is required to promptly notify Hanger and to use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain alternative financing in an amount that when added with the Equity Financing would be sufficient
to enable Parent to meet its funding obligations contemplated by the Merger Agreement, provided that the
terms of such alternative financing are on terms as favorable to Parent as the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter or are as are reasonably available for financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter in debt markets at such time. As of the last practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement
with the SEC, the Debt Commitment Letter remains in effect. The documentation governing the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual
terms of the Debt Financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement. The Debt Commitment
Parties may invite other banks, financial institutions and institutional lenders to participate in the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

Equity Financing
On July 21, 2022, Patient Square Equity entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with Parent pursuant to
which Patient Square Equity committed to make or cause to be made a cash equity investment of $410 million
to Parent. This Equity Financing is subject to the following conditions:
the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement;
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, written waiver by Parent and Merger Sub
(with the prior written consent of Patient Square Equity) of each of the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than
those closing conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at closing and would be, if the closing
of the Merger occurs, satisfied or waived);
the prior or substantially simultaneous receipt of the net cash proceeds of the Debt Financing and/or
any replacement debt financing; and
the substantially contemporaneous occurrence of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement.
Patient Square Equity’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter (including the obligation to fund the
Equity Financing) will terminate automatically and immediately, upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the
occurrence of the Effective Time; (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms;
(iii) Hanger or certain of its related parties that Hanger has the power to control instituting any proceeding
asserting a claim (other than any retained claims) against Patient Square Equity or certain of its related
parties under or otherwise related to the Equity Commitment Letter, the limited guaranty, the Merger
Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or transactions contemplated thereby; (iv) Hanger or certain of
its related parties instituting any proceeding asserting that any of the provisions of the Equity Commitment
Letter are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part or the limitations on Patient Square Equity’s or
certain of its related parties’ liabilities or obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter are illegal, invalid
or unenforceable in whole or in part or that Patient Square Equity is liable under the Equity Commitment
Letter in excess of the Equity Financing Commitment; or (v) the occurrence of any event under Patient
Square Equity’s limited guaranty that terminates Patient Square Equity’s obligations or liabilities under the
limited guaranty.
Hanger is an express third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter and is entitled to specifically
enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter to cause Parent to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter
and cause Patient Square Equity to fund the Equity Financing Commitment substantially simultaneously with
the occurrence of the Effective Time in the event the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter are
satisfied, the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to specific performance of the
Equity Financing are satisfied and Parent is required pursuant to a final and non-appealable order of a
chosen court to consummate the Transactions.",68,70

To induce Hanger to enter into the Merger Agreement, Patient Square Equity entered into a limited guaranty
in favor of Hanger pursuant to which Patient Square Equity absolutely and irrevocably guaranteed to
Hanger, on the terms and conditions set forth in the limited guaranty, the due, prompt and faithful payment
of (i) the reverse termination fee payable by Parent to Hanger, if and when due in accordance with the
Merger Agreement, (ii) if Parent fails to timely pay the reverse termination fee to Hanger, the obligation to
reimburse Hanger for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the collection of the
reverse termination fee up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate and interest on such unpaid reverse termination fee,
(iii) subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, any monetary damages awarded to Hanger
pursuant to a final and non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of any Willful
and Material Breach (as defined in “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement”) by
Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) any reimbursement and/or indemnification
obligations of Parent to Hanger and its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and other
representatives that may arise pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to the Debt
62 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Financing (collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”); provided, that the maximum amount payable by
Patient Square Equity under the limited guaranty may not exceed $50 million.
The guaranty by Patient Square Equity of the Guaranteed Obligations under the limited guaranty may be
enforced only for money damages. The limited guaranty may not be revoked or terminated and will remain in
full force and effect and binding on Patient Square Equity, its successors, and permitted assigns until the
complete, irrevocable, and indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.
However, the limited guaranty will automatically and immediately terminate as of the earliest to occur of (i)
the Effective Time, (ii) the funding of the commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter, provided the
Effective Time also occurs, (iii) for each of the following subclauses (a) and (b), the date that is 90 days after
the termination of the Merger Agreement by (a) Hanger due to a breach or failure to preform by Parent or
Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger
Agreement or by Hanger due to Parent’s failure to complete the Merger when the closing conditions under
the Merger Agreement have been satisfied, as more fully described in “The Merger Agreement - Termination
of the Merger Agreement”, or (b) Hanger or Parent, if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before the
applicable Outside Date and at a time when Hanger could have terminated the Merger Agreement pursuant to
the termination provisions discussed in subclause (a) immediately above (each, a “Specified Termination”),
unless prior to 90  day after such termination, Hanger has commenced a proceeding against Parent and/or
Patient Square Equity alleging that the Guaranteed Obligations are payable pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, (iv) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (other than pursuant to a
Specified Termination), (v) the time at which the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full
in cash, (vi) the time at which Hanger or certain of its related parties that Hanger has the power to control or
their respective successors and assigns institutes any proceeding asserting any theory of liability against
Patient Square Equity, certain of its related parties with respect to the Transactions, the limited guaranty, the
Equity Commitment Letter or any other ancillary agreement, other than the retained claims (as defined in the
limited guaranty) under the limited guaranty or (vii) the time at which Hanger or certain of its related parties
or their respective successors and assigns institutes any proceeding asserting that the limit on the
Guaranteed Obligations of $50 million is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part.",70,71

Following the announcement of the Merger on July 21, 2022, two substantially similar actions have been filed
by purported Hanger stockholders against Hanger and our board of directors, and Hanger has received one
demand letter. On August 9, 2022, a lawsuit styled Stein v. Hanger, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-6775
was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 17, 2022, a
lawsuit styled Singh v. Hanger, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-07023 was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints and demand letter assert similar claims
against Hanger and our board of directors under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The complaints and demand letter allege, among other things, that the
preliminary proxy statement filed August 5, 2022 with the SEC misstated or omitted material information
regarding the financial projections, the financial analyses performed by Hanger’s financial advisor, potential
conflicts of interest of our board of directors and management and the sales process leading up to the
Merger. The complaints seek to enjoin the Merger unless and until the alleged omitted material information is
disclosed, rescission of the Merger Agreement and/or rescissory damages, compensatory damages,
attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs. Hanger believes the lawsuits and the demand letter are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of
or relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed or made in the future, which could prevent or
delay completion of the Merger and result in additional costs to the Company. If additional similar
complaints or demands are filed or made, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company
will not necessarily announce them.",71,71

General
If the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Hanger common stock who do not vote in favor of or do not
otherwise consent in writing to the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement (and for which
63 
th• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal rights have not been waived) and who properly demand an appraisal of their shares and who
otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of the
DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements will result in the
loss of your appraisal rights.
This section summarizes material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following
discussion, however, is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as
Appendix B to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references within Section 262
of the DGCL to “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Hanger common stock. The following
discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to
whether or not a Hanger stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL.
Under the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of Hanger common stock, continuously hold such shares
through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of or do not otherwise consent in writing to the adoption
and approval of the Merger Agreement and otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL, you will be entitled to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger or related transactions) in
cash, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. It is possible
that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the
same as, the Merger Consideration which Hanger stockholders will be entitled to receive upon the
consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the special meeting at which the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, Hanger must notify each
stockholder who was a Hanger stockholder on the Record Date and who is entitled to exercise appraisal
rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This
proxy statement constitutes the required notice, and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Appendix B to
this proxy statement.
A HOLDER OF HANGER COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO
WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS AND
APPENDIX B CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO COMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES OF SECTION 262
OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK
APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF HANGER COMMON STOCK WHO IS
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH
ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL AND/OR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. ANY SHARES OF HANGER COMMON
STOCK HELD BY A HANGER STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT, SUCCESSFULLY WITHDRAWS
OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
CONVERTED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are a Hanger stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Hanger
common stock, you must comply with ALL of the following:
you must NOT vote “FOR,” or otherwise consent in writing to, the Merger Proposal. Because a proxy
that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,
be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal
rights, you must include voting instructions to vote your share “AGAINST,” or as an abstention with
respect to, the Merger Proposal;
64 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
you must continuously hold your shares of Hanger common stock from the date of making the written
demand for appraisal through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer
your shares of Hanger common stock before the Effective Time;
prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, you must deliver a
proper written demand for appraisal of your shares; and
you, another stockholder who has complied with the applicable subsections of Section 262 of the
DGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, an appropriate
beneficial owner or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
requesting a determination of the fair value of your shares of Hanger common stock within 120 days
after the Effective Time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any such petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of
the appropriate Hanger stockholders to initiate all necessary action to properly demand their
appraisal rights in respect of shares of Hanger common stock within the time prescribed in Section
262 of the DGCL.
Filing a Written Demand
Neither voting against the Merger Proposal, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger
Proposal, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section
262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of Hanger common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must
deliver to Hanger, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, a written
demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written demand
prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of
appraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote
on the Merger Proposal.
A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of
record may demand appraisal rights for the shares of Hanger common stock registered in that holder’s name.
Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Hanger of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends to demand appraisal of the “fair value” of his, her or its shares of Hanger common stock.
Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of Hanger common stock of record may not directly
make appraisal demands to Hanger. The beneficial owner must, in such case, arrange for the holder of record,
such as a bank, broker or nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of
Hanger common stock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, who holds shares of Hanger
common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the
shares of Hanger common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for
other beneficial owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of Hanger common stock as
to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Hanger common stock is expressly mentioned,
the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Hanger common stock held in the name of the holder of
record.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR
OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT
WITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE
BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.
IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF HANGER COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD
IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT
PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER
THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF
HANGER COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK OR BROKERAGE FIRM WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE
SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY
TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON
BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE
HOLDER OF RECORD.
65 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If your shares of Hanger common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, execution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your
shares are owned of record jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, the demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a
stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly
disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of
record. Stockholders who hold their shares of Hanger common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee
forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers or other nominees to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written
demand to:
Hanger, Inc. 
10910 Domain Drive, Suite 300 
Austin, Texas 78758 
Attention: Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Hanger stockholder that made a demand for appraisal
but has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have
the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger
Agreement for his, her or its shares of Hanger common stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a
written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal, but after such 60 day period a demand for appraisal may be
withdrawn only with the written approval of the surviving corporation.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation. Within ten days after the effective date of the Merger, Hanger, as the
surviving corporation, must notify each holder of Hanger common stock who has made a written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal of the date
that the Merger has become effective.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective
Time, but not later, either you or another stockholder, provided you or such other stockholder have complied
with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the
surviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by you or another
stockholder, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Hanger common stock held by all
stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. None of Patient Square, Parent, Merger Sub or Hanger,
as the surviving corporation, is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any intention to do
so. If you desire to have your shares of Hanger common stock appraised, you should initiate any petitions
necessary for properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed
in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, you will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Hanger common stock not voted in favor of the Merger
Proposal and with respect to which Hanger has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of
holders of those shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) ten
days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (ii) ten days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of Hanger common
stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf you may, in your own name, file
an appraisal petition or request from the surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph. If a
petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of Hanger common stock who has
properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation
66 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware
Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares of Hanger common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of
their shares of Hanger common stock have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the petition hearing be given to the
surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein.
Any such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or any other
publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notice by mail and by
publication will be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery and the costs thereof will be borne by the
surviving corporation.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to
conduct a hearing on the petition to determine which Hanger stockholders have complied with Section 262 of
the DGCL and have become entitled to appraisal rights and may require the Hanger stockholders demanding
appraisal who hold certificated shares of Hanger common stock to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware
Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any Hanger stockholder who fails to comply with this
direction. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such
shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Hanger common
stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Hanger common stock, or (ii) the value of
the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Hanger common stock exceeds
$1 million.
The appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Hanger common stock owned by such
stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Hanger common stock held by all Hanger stockholders
who have properly demanded their appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise
for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry
of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal
an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if
any, to the Hanger stockholders entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated
stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the surviving corporation of their stock
certificates.
Determination of Fair Value. In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to
take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the
factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community
and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires
consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has
stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which were known or which
could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
67 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the
DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair
value of shares of Hanger common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than,
the same as or less than the Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor Hanger, as the surviving corporation,
anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Hanger stockholder exercising appraisal
rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the
DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Hanger common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time, you will lose the right to an
appraisal and will instead receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement,
without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include
attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Hanger common stock entitled to appraisal.
In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you will not, from and
after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote the shares of Hanger common stock subject to the demand for
any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other
distributions payable to holders of record of Hanger common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective
Time.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may
withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of
the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration payable in the Merger to the surviving
corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require
written approval of the surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of
Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery.
Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided,
however, that this provision will not affect the right of any Hanger stockholder that has made an appraisal
demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within 60
days after the Effective Time. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your demand for
appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Hanger common stock will be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to
U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) of Hanger common stock who receive cash in
exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general
informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
consequences of the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than
those pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local and non-U.S.
tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings and
administrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date of this proxy statement.
These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations, and any such change or differing
interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and
conclusions set forth in this summary. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying
interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the
statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. There can be no assurance that the
IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of
the Merger.
This discussion is limited to holders of shares of Hanger common stock who hold such shares as “capital
assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This
discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in
light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the application of the alternative minimum tax. In
addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders subject to
special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
persons holding shares of Hanger common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction
strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;
banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;
brokers or dealers in securities or foreign currencies;
traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
“S corporations,” partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities (and investors therein);
real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies;
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;
persons deemed to sell their shares of Hanger common stock under the constructive sale provisions
of the Code;
persons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or, following the Merger, the
surviving corporation;
persons who hold or received their shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the exercise of any
employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; and
tax-qualified retirement plans.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequence to holders of shares of
Hanger common stock who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of
Hanger common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status
of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level.
Accordingly, partnerships holding Hanger common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult
their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF
HANGER COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE U.S.
FEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN THOSE PERTAINING TO INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT
TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME
TAX TREATY.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
Definition of a U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of Hanger common stock
that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is or is treated as:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created
or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more “United States
persons”  (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a “United States
person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or
loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger will
generally equal the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for such shares (determined
before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted basis in such
shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid
for such share. The amount and character of such gain or loss and the holding period of shares will be
determined separately for each block of shares of Hanger common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same
cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder
upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of Hanger common stock in the Merger will generally be
capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more
than one year at the Effective Time. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss, which
is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized
by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a reduced rate. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
A surtax of up to 3.8% may apply to so-called “net investment income” of certain U.S. citizens or residents,
and to undistributed “net investment income” of certain estates and trusts. Net investment income includes
any gain recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the
Merger. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the tax on gain recognized
pursuant to the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock pursuant to the Merger may
be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid
backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should
complete and return to the Paying Agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of
transmittal certifying that such holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is
correct and that such holder is not subject to backup withholding. Certain holders (including corporations)
are not subject to backup withholding or these information reporting rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. holder
pursuant to the Merger under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against
such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an
exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Hanger common
stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt
of cash in exchange for shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger unless:
the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, such gain is also attributable to a
permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base, maintained by the non-U.S.
holder in the United States);
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year of the disposition of shares of Hanger common stock in the Merger, and
certain other requirements are met; or
Hanger is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger
or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of Hanger common stock and the non-U.S. holder
held (actually or constructively) more than five percent of the shares of Hanger common stock at any
time during such five-year period.
Gain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net
income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S.
holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax
at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax
profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not
reinvested and maintained in the business.
Gain described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate
of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset
by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident
of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with
respect to such losses.
With respect to the third bullet point above, the determination of whether Hanger is a USRPHC depends on
the fair market value of its United States real property interests relative to the fair market value

"HANGER, INC._20220826_DEFM14A_20309851_4510081.Pdf",Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act has expired or been terminated. In addition, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable
waiting period under Washington Revised Code 19.390.010 et. seq., a statute pertaining to certain health care
transactions in the State of Washington, has expired. Although we expect that all required regulatory
clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and
approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and
approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the Merger cannot be completed until
Hanger and Parent (the “Parties”) each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the DOJ under
the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period thereunder has expired or been terminated. A transaction
notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period
following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that
waiting period. The Parties filed their respective HSR Act pre-merger notification and report forms on August
2, 2022 with the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act.
Under Washington Revised Code 19.390.010, et. seq., the Merger cannot be completed until Hanger submits
a copy of its HSR Act filing to the Washington Attorney General and the applicable waiting period
thereunder has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under Washington Revised Code
19.390.010, et. seq., may not be completed until the expiration of a 60 calendar day waiting period following
the submission of Hanger’s HSR Act notification form to the Washington Attorney General. Hanger filed its
HSR Act notification form with the Washington Attorney General on August 2, 2022.
The Parties may receive a request for additional information and documentary material (a “Second Request”)
from the FTC or DOJ in connection with the FTC’s or DOJ’s review of the transaction. The
72 TABLE OF CONTENTS
effect of a Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after the
Parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by
the Parties or terminated sooner by the FTC or DOJ.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger,
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the Parties or requiring the Parties to license, or hold separate,
assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of
the Merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any
state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such
action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial
assets of the Parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.

Merger Consideration
Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each share of Hanger common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) shares held by Hanger as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger
Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hanger, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) Dissenting
Shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All shares of
Hanger common stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and will thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.
Outstanding Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Hanger or any holder of securities of Hanger, for the following treatment with
respect to equity and equity-based awards relating to Hanger common stock:
Stock Options
Each option to purchase shares of Hanger common stock (each, a “Company Option”), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and be
converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax
withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying the
Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of
such Company Option (less taxes required to be withheld under applicable law). If the exercise price of
75 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
a Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will be
cancelled for no consideration.
Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Each outstanding award of (i) Hanger restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units or performance-
based restricted stock units, in each case that at such time is subject solely to service-based vesting
conditions (collectively, the “Company RSUs”) will become fully vested and will automatically be cancelled
and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less any applicable tax
withholdings) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Hanger common stock underlying such award of
Company RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and (ii) Hanger performance-based restricted
stock units that at such time is subject to performance-based vesting conditions (collectively, the “Company
PRSUs”) will become vested as to the number of shares of Hanger common stock subject to such award that
would vest based on target level achievement of all performance targets (without application of any modifier)

instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon receipt of (i) in the case of shares of Hanger common stock represented by a stock
certificate, a surrendered certificate or certificates (or affidavit of loss) in respect of such shares together
with the signed letter of transmittal, or (ii) in the case of shares of Hanger common stock held in book-entry
form (other than shares held through The Depository Trust Company), the receipt of the signed letter of
transmittal, the Paying Agent or such other agent, in accordance with the letter of transmittal and
instructions, will transmit to the holder of such shares the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor and
such certificates or book-entry shares will be cancelled.
As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to
The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, in respect of each book-entry share held through The
Depository Trust Company, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration
(subject to any withholding of taxes) that holders of such book-entry shares will be automatically entitled to
receive, and such book-entry shares of such holder will be cancelled.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Hanger will be closed and thereafter there will be no further
registration of transfers of shares on the records of Hanger, and holders of Certificates and book-entry
shares will cease to have rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided in the Merger
Agreement or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the surviving
corporation for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the Merger Agreement.
If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent remains unclaimed by holders of Hanger common stock on the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, such cash (including any interest received in respect thereto) will be
returned to the surviving corporation, and any holders of Hanger common stock who have not complied with
the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Parent and the surviving
corporation (as general unsecured creditors) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to any applicable withholding taxes and abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the holders of Hanger common
stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any governmental entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving
corporation free and clear of any claim or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder of such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (and if required by Parent, the posting by the
owners of a bond, in a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the surviving corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such
Certificate), the Paying Agent will, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate, pay the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement.",84,85

All of Hanger’s representations and warranties are qualified by reference to the disclosure in Hanger’s
filings with the SEC on or after January 1, 2020 and prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (other than
disclosures contained in the “Forward Looking Statements” or “Risk Factors” sections of such SEC filings)
and as set forth in Hanger’s disclosure schedule delivered to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.
In addition, many of Hanger’s representations and warranties are qualified by knowledge or by a materiality
or “Company Material Adverse Effect” standard. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company
Material Adverse Effect” means any change, effect, event, occurrence, circumstance, condition, fact, state of
facts or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, assets, liabilities, operations or results of
operations of Hanger and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The foregoing notwithstanding, adverse effects
arising out of or arising from the following will not constitute or be deemed to contribute to a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and will not otherwise be taken into account in determining whether such Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur:
any changes or proposed changes in applicable laws, GAAP or the interpretation or enforcement
thereof;
any changes in general economic, business, labor or regulatory conditions or in securities, credit or
other financial markets, including inflation, monetary policy, commodity prices, interest rates or

(whether declared or not), military action or operation, sabotage, civil unrest, civil disobedience,
national or international calamity, the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism), changes due to
natural disasters or changes in the weather or changes due to the outbreak or worsening of an
epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis (including COVID-19, or the taking of any permitted actions
by Hanger or COVID-19 measures required to be taken by Hanger, or changes in such COVID-19
measures required to be taken by Hanger after the date of the Merger Agreement));
any actions or omissions required of Hanger under the Merger Agreement or taken or not taken at the
request of, or with the consent of, Parent;
the negotiation, announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger Agreement and the
Merger;
any proceeding commenced by or involving any governmental entity or a current or former
stockholder of Hanger arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or violation of Law relating
to the Merger Agreement or the Transactions;
changes in the trading price or trading volume of shares of Hanger common stock or any suspension
of trading, or any changes in the ratings or the ratings outlook for Hanger by any applicable rating
agency or changes in the analyst’s recommendations or ratings with respect to Hanger (provided that
the underlying cause of such change may be taken into account in determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred); or
any failure by Hanger or any of its subsidiaries to meet any revenue, earnings, adjusted EBITDA or
other financial projections or forecasts (provided that the underlying cause of such failure may be
taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred).
Any change referred to in the first four bullets above may be taken into account in determining whether there
has occurred, or would reasonably be expected to occur, a Company Material Adverse Effect to the

If at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval (i) Hanger has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party, (ii)
Hanger has not breached the “no solicitation” provisions of the Merger Agreement in any respect with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines
in good faith (after consultation with and advice from its financial advisor and outside counsel), based on

their respective representatives) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and otherwise facilitate such
Acquisition Proposal or assist such third party making such Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives,
prospective debt and equity financing sources and/or their respective representatives) with such
Acquisition Proposal.
Hanger will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in the event that Hanger receives any
Acquisition Proposal including providing (i) the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal
and (ii) a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or, where no such copy is available, a reasonable description of
such Acquisition Proposal. Hanger will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after such determination)
advise Parent if Hanger determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal.
If Hanger has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with and advice from its financial advisors
and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board may at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal and/or terminate the Merger Agreement and pay the termination fee to Parent as described in “-
Termination Fees” in order to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal. Hanger, however, is not entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate the
Merger Agreement unless:
Hanger provided to Parent at least five days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice will specify the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and will
have provided to Parent a copy of the available proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in
respect of such Acquisition Proposal;
during the five day notice period described above, if requested by Parent, Hanger will have, and will
have caused its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
regarding any amendment to the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and intended to
cause the relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and
the Board will have considered in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to the
Merger Agreement (including a change to the price terms thereof) and the other agreements
contemplated thereby that were irrevocably offered in writing by Parent no later than 11:59 A.M.,
Eastern time, on the last day of such five day notice period, and will have determined in good faith
that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such adjustments or
amendments proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal offered in writing by the party making the
Superior Proposal, Hanger is required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the
requirements of the “no solicitation” provisions of the Merger Agreement with respect to such new written
notice, except that the five day notice period will be three days with respect to any such revised Superior
Proposal.
The Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, effect a Change of Board Recommendation if the Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that (i) an Intervening
Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Hanger stockholders under applicable law. However, the Board will not be entitled to effect a Change of
Board Recommendation because of the occurrence of an Intervening Event unless:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Hanger has given Parent at least five days’ prior written notice advising Parent of the material
information and facts relating to such Intervening Event and stating that the Board intends to make a
Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event;
during the five day notice period described above, Hanger has engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent (if Parent wishes to so negotiate) regarding any adjustments to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement as would obviate the need for the Board to proceed with a Change of Board
Recommendation; and
at the end of such five day notice period described above, the Board (after consultation with
Hanger’s outside legal counsel and taking into account any adjustments offered by Parent to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) maintains its determination that the failure of the
Board to make such a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Hanger stockholders
under applicable law.
Each time any material amendment or modification to the Intervening Event occurs, Hanger will notify Parent
of such amendment or modification in writing and the notice period will be extended for two days from the
date of such notification.
Hanger or the Board may (i) disclose to the Hanger stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a),
Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) make any
disclosure to the stockholders of Hanger if the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Hanger stockholders or violate
applicable law. The issuance by Hanger or the Board of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending
disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
will not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.
As used in this proxy statement:
“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal from a third party concerning (i) a merger,

The parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and
to specific performance as to its terms, and the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and will waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law.
Hanger’s or Parent’s pursuit of seeking specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled,
including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the other party in the
case of a breach of the Merger Agreement involving a Willful and Material Breach, as described in the next
paragraph. Under no circumstances will Hanger or any of its affiliates be permitted or entitled to seek or
receive both (i) a grant of specific performance in accordance with the Merger Agreement and (ii) the
payment of all and a portion of Parent’s reverse termination fee or any other monetary damages from Parent
or any related party to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hanger will be entitled to specific performance
to enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter (subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein) and to consummate the
closing in accordance with the Merger Agreement, only if, (i) the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to complete the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than the conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the closing, all of which would be satisfied if the closing of the Merger would
occur as of such date), (ii) Hanger has irrevocably confirmed in writing that (a) all of the conditions to the
obligations of Hanger to complete the Merger have been satisfied (other than those conditions to the
closing of the Merger that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, all of which will be
satisfied if the closing of the Merger would occur as of such date) or that Hanger is willing to waive any
such open conditions and (b) if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, the closing of
the Merger will occur, (iii) the Debt Financing (or any replacement of the Debt Financing) has been funded or
will be funded at the closing of the Merger if the Equity Financing is funded at the closing of the Merger,
and (iv) Parent has failed to cause the closing of the Merger to occur by the date the closing of the Merger is
required to have occurred pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
In circumstances where the Parent reverse termination fee described under “- Termination Fees” is not
payable in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Hanger may seek to recover monetary damages from
Parent for a Willful and Material Breach (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not for any other breach or failure
to perform under the Merger Agreement) that occurs prior to such termination. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the parties acknowledged and agreed the maximum aggregate liability
of Parent, Merger Sub and Parent’s related parties for monetary damages relating to or arising out of the
Merger Agreement or the Transactions, including any breach or failure to perform thereunder (whether such
breach or failure to perform is knowing, deliberate, willful, unintentional, a Willful and Material Breach or
otherwise), or the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated, exceed an amount
equal to $50 million, and in no event will Hanger or any of its related parties seek or be entitled to obtain, nor
will they permit any of their representatives or any other person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor
will any person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary damages (including any consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages) from Parent or any of its related parties in excess of such amount. Neither
Hanger nor any of its related parties will be permitted or entitled to receive both the Parent reverse
termination fee, on the one hand, and to seek monetary damages, awards, fees or other amounts against
Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parent’s related parties for any losses suffered by Hanger or any of its related
parties in connection with the specified matters related to Transactions, on the other hand.",106,106

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. For a detailed discussion of the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, see “The Merger Agreement”. A copy of the Merger Agreement is
attached as Appendix A of this proxy statement.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
As discussed in “The Merger - Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger”,
after considering various factors described in such section, the Board unanimously (i) determined and
declared that the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger is a party and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Hanger and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the ancillary agreements to which Hanger
is a party and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of Hanger for its adoption and approval
and (iv) recommended that Hanger’s stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
Under Delaware law, approval of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Hanger common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter as of the
Record Date. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.

The Adjournment Proposal
We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or
dates if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt and approve the Merger
Agreement at the time of the special meeting. If our stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we
could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting to solicit additional
proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement. Among other things,
approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a
sufficient number of votes against adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement such that the Merger
Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares of Hanger common
stock to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement.
Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present at the special meeting.
If the special meeting is adjourned, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to
revoke them at any time prior to the vote on the proposals. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a
notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
of Hanger common stock represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. Abstentions as to the Adjournment Proposal with respect to shares of Hanger common stock
otherwise present at the special meeting and entitled to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of Hanger and its stockholders to be able to adjourn the
special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in respect
of the Merger Proposal if there are insufficient votes to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement at the time
of the special meeting.
In addition, if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the meeting or the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all of the shares of Hanger common stock represented at the
special meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon, although less than a quorum, may
adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
The Compensation Proposal
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Hanger is providing its stockholders with the
opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on certain compensation that will or may become payable
to the named executive officers of Hanger in connection with the Merger, including the agreements and
understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may become payable, the value of which is set
forth in “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger - Named
Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation”.
For purposes of this proxy statement, our named executive officers consist of:
Vinit K. Asar, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Thomas E. Kiraly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
Peter A. Stoy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,
Thomas E. Hartman, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and
C. Scott Ranson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Services and Chief Information Officer.
The Board encourages you to carefully review the named executive officer Merger-related compensation
information disclosed in this proxy statement. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Hanger is
asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption and approval of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or
may become payable to Hanger’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the
agreements and understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may become payable, as
disclosed in “The Merger - Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Hanger in the Merger -
Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation” in Hanger’s proxy statement for the special
meeting.”
Stockholders should note that this proposal is separate and apart from Proposal 1 above and is not a
condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Hanger, the
Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and payments
made pursuant to the terms of these plans and agreements are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, our
named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to
the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Hanger common stock represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. Abstentions as to the Compensation Proposal with respect to shares of Hanger common stock
otherwise present at the special meeting and entitled to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”

The following tables set forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of Hanger common
stock as of August 24, 2022, the Record Date, by (i) each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of
more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of Hanger common stock; (ii) each of our directors;
(iii) each of our named executive officers; and (iv) all of our directors and executive officers as a group. Such
information (other than with respect to our directors and executive officers and their affiliates) is based on a
review of statements filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act with
respect to our common stock.
The amounts and percentages of shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of SEC regulations
governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be
a “beneficial” owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power, which
includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be
a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within
60 days. Securities that can be so acquired are not deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing any
other person’s percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner
of securities, and some persons may be deemed to be beneficial owners of securities as to which such
persons have no economic interest.
Except as otherwise indicated in these footnotes, each of the beneficial owners listed has, to our knowledge,
sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of our common stock reported and the business
address of each such beneficial owner is c/o Hanger, Inc., 10910 Domain Drive, Suite 300, Austin, Texas

stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in our stockholders’ meetings. Hanger will
hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2023 (the “2023 Annual Meeting”) only if the Merger has not
already been completed.
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at and
included in the proxy materials for the 2023 Annual Meeting, which presently is expected to be held in May
2023, must be received by the Secretary of Hanger, 10910 Domain Drive, Suite 300, Austin, Texas 78758, no
later than December 8, 2022 for them to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2023

In addition, a stockholder desiring to submit a proposal to be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting,
including nominating persons for election as directors, but not desiring to have such proposal included in
the proxy materials for the 2023 Annual Meeting, must submit such proposal in accordance with the
requirements set forth in our bylaws. Among other things, a stockholder must submit such a proposal to
Hanger between December 8, 2022 and January 7, 2023. Failure to comply with this advance notice
requirement will permit management to use its discretionary voting authority if and when the proposal is
raised at the 2023 Annual Meeting without having had a discussion of the proposal in the proxy materials.
Further, to comply with the Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee’s policy pursuant to which a

DELAWARE - APPRAISAL RIGHTS","TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Appendix B​
DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW
Section 262. Appraisal Rights.
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds
such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor
consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant
by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected
pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately
prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either:
(i) listed on a national securities exchange or
(ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did
not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in
§ 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof
are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares
of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of
the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders;
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares
or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this
section.
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §
253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed by 2020 Amendment.]
B-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its
certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to
be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such
meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that
appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may
be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing
system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or
consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so
by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger
or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or
consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
effective; or
(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title,
then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class
or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of
the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing
from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a
demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying
each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to
appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective
date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to
appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this
B-2 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given
on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date.
If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding
as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled
to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded
stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and
accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a
statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value
of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The
Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing
of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices
by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class
or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a
national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who
are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds
1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
B-3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger
was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall
accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled
to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each
such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.
The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether
such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.
(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion
of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation
a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in
subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of
such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept
the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders
would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of
authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Hanger, Inc. (“Hanger”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of July 21, 2022 (the “Agreement”), among Hanger, Hero Parent, Inc. (“Parent”) and Hero Merger Sub,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger
Sub will merge with and into Hanger (the “Merger”), and each outstanding share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Hanger (“Hanger Common Stock”) will be converted into the right to receive $18.75
per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in
the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Hanger
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares, as defined in the Agreement) of the Consideration to be
received by such holders in the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Hanger;
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business,
operations and prospects of Hanger furnished to or discussed with us by the management of
Hanger, including certain financial forecasts relating to Hanger prepared by the management of
Hanger (such forecasts, the “Hanger Forecasts”);
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Hanger
with members of senior management of Hanger;
reviewed the trading history for Hanger Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history
with the trading histories of other companies we deemed relevant;
compared certain financial and stock market information of Hanger with similar information of
other companies we deemed relevant;
compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available,
of other transactions we deemed relevant;
considered the results of our efforts on behalf of Hanger to solicit, at the direction of Hanger,
indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible
acquisition of Hanger;
reviewed a draft, dated July 21, 2022, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as
we deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the management of

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a nationally recognized bank

A-3 TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Shares represented by certificates (the “Certificates”), which Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section
2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to
such Certificates, the Paying Agent or such other agent, in accordance with the letter of transmittal
and instructions, shall transmit to the holder of such Certificates the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates (subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required

holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall be
required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a). In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository
Trust Company whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry Shares of such
holder shall be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than
three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal,
which shall be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B)
instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
delivery of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall at the Effective Time be cancelled. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall only be made to the Person
in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Agreement.

are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such
Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement, including the Merger,
or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal rights with
respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, in
accordance with, but only if and when required by, the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
rights, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, on the terms and subject
to the conditions in this Agreement and shall no longer constitute Dissenting Shares hereunder. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other

2.4 Treatment of Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.
(a) Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any securities of the Company, each option to
purchase Shares (each a “Company Option”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and be converted into the right
to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product
of (x) the total number of Shares underlying the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option, which amount, less any
Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Law, shall be payable by the Surviving Corporation as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system, but
no later than five Business Days following the Closing Date; provided that any such Company Option
with respect to which the exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.

(without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to (x) the total number of
Shares underlying such award of Company RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and (ii)
each outstanding award of Company performance-based restricted stock units that at such time is
subject to performance-based vesting conditions (“Company PRSUs”) and is outstanding immediately

modifier), and shall, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive

(a) Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any securities of the Company, each option to
purchase Shares (each a “Company Option”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and be converted into the right
to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product
of (x) the total number of Shares underlying the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option, which amount, less any
Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Law, shall be payable by the Surviving Corporation as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system, but
no later than five Business Days following the Closing Date; provided that any such Company Option
with respect to which the exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.

Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company

based restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units or restricted stock units, in each case that at
such time is subject solely to service-based vesting conditions (collectively, “Company RSUs”), shall
become fully vested and shall automatically be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to (x) the total number of
Shares underlying such award of Company RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and (ii)
each outstanding award of Company performance-based restricted stock units that at such time is
subject to performance-based vesting conditions (“Company PRSUs”) and is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become vested as to the number of Shares subject to such award that
would vest based on target level achievement of all performance targets (without application of any
modifier), and shall, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to (x) the number of vested
Shares underlying such award, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration and the unvested portion of
such Company PRSUs will be cancelled for no consideration.
(c) Payment by Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company RSUs and Company PRSUs the amounts
described in Sections 2.4(a) and 2.4(b), less any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Law with
respect to such payments, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, through the Surviving
Corporation’s payroll system, but not later than five Business Days following the Closing Date.
(d) Termination of Company Equity Plans. As of the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plans shall be
terminated and no further Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PRSUs, other Equity
Interests in the Company or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. Following
the Effective Time, no such Company Option, Company RSU, Company PRSU, Equity Interest or other
right that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each
former holder of any such Company Option, Company RSU, Company PRSU, Equity Interest or other
right shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
set forth in this Section 2.4.
(e) Board Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall provide such notices, if any, to the extent required under the terms of any of the Company
Equity Plans, adopt appropriate resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary,

date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received
a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) the Company has not breached this
Section 5.3 in any respect with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with and advice from its
financial advisor and outside counsel), based on information then available, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company
and its Representatives may, directly or indirectly through the Company’s Representatives: (A) subject
to the entry into, and solely in accordance with, an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, furnish to
such Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives, prospective debt and
equity financing sources and/or their respective Representatives) any non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to such Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives, prospective debt and equity financing sources and/or their respective
Representatives) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
any material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made
available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent or
Merger Sub, be provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub as promptly as reasonably
practicable after it is provided or made available to such Third Party; and (B) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal (and its

prospective debt and equity financing sources and/or their respective Representatives) with such
Acquisition Proposal.
(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal, including providing (i) the
identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonable description of such Acquisition Proposal).
Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours after such determination) advise Parent if the Company determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to Section 5.3(b).
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), if the Company has received a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with and advice from its financial advisors and
outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with
respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), in
either case subject to the requirements of this Section 5.3(d). The Company shall not be entitled to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) unless the Company shall have provided to Parent at least five days’ prior
written notice (the “Notice Period”) of the Company’s intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and shall have provided to
Parent a copy of the available proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in respect of such
Acquisition Proposal, and:
(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have caused
its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
any amendment to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the
relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and
(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed
amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other
agreements contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
“Proposed Changed Terms”) no later than 11:59 a.m., Eastern time, on the last day of the Notice
Period and shall have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.
In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in writing by the Third Party
making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
and to again comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d) with respect to such new written
notice, except that the Notice Period shall be three days with respect to any such revised Superior
Proposal.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
effect a Change of Board Recommendation if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that (i) an Intervening Event
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that such Change
of Board Recommendation shall not occur unless (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least five
days’ prior written notice advising Parent of the material information and facts relating to such
Intervening Event and stating that the Company Board intends to make a Change of Board
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event, (B) during such five day period, the Company
has negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate the need for the Company
Board to effect a Change of Board Recommendation, and (C) at the end of such five day period, the
Company Board (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and taking into account
any adjustments offered by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) maintains its
determination described in this clause (ii) that the failure of the Company Board to make such a Change
of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
provided, further, that each time any material amendment or modification to the Intervening Event
occurs, the Company shall notify Parent of such amendment or modification in writing and the time
period set forth in the preceding clause (ii) shall be extended for two days from the day of such
notification.
(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company or violate applicable Law. The issuance by the Company or the Company
Board of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Board
Recommendation.

comment on such written communication, which comments will be considered and reflected by the filing
party in good faith. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will
advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its
staff for (A) any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or
any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, (B) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its

necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Regulatory
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Transactions so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than the Extended
Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing or agreeing to, and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, transfer, licensing or disposition of any

properties, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other Order in any suit or Proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing, as applicable, and (iii)
resisting, contesting, defending and appealing, including through litigation, any Proceeding (including
any administrative or judicial Proceeding) or any other claim asserted by any Person in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated, reversed or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring by the Extended Outside Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, none of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate
holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition,
ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of
rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
in each case, is not conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions.
(c) Parent shall control and direct the overall process and strategy for effecting filings and obtaining
approvals under the HSR Act and applicable Regulatory Laws (including but not limited to determining
whether to pull and refile the notification and report form required under the HSR Act and any other
filing under applicable Regulatory Laws, and determining whether to enter into a timing agreement with
any Governmental Entity) and take the lead in all communications with Governmental Entities in
connection with the same; provided, that, to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent shall consult in
advance with the Company and in good faith take the Company’s views into account regarding the
overall strategic direction in connection with such filings and approvals.

assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or equity, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (A)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate any of the
Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (B) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking an Order prohibiting the consummation of any of the
Transactions, (C) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or
otherwise, or (D) materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the Transactions.
(e) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, including Section 5.1, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control, supervise or
direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete

indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent
permitted under (i) applicable Law and (ii) the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws or similar
organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director

a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an
“Indemnitee” and, collectively, the “Indemnitees”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.
(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses arising
from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the Effective Time in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries serving in
such capacity at or prior to the Effective Time and each of their respective employees who serves as a
fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan as provided in its certificates of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect
the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable party’s
certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or
employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals
who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding; provided, however, that the
advancement and payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the final
disposition of a Proceeding shall be made, unless otherwise agreed by the Surviving Corporation, only
upon delivery to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party
to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be determined as set forth in a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 5.9(b), upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall
promptly notify the Surviving Corporation in writing (but the failure to so notify shall not relieve a party
from any obligations that it may have under this Section 5.9(b), except to the extent such failure
prejudices such Party’s position with respect to such claims) and shall reasonably cooperate (subject
to, for the avoidance of doubt, his or her indemnification and expense advancement rights in this
Section 5.9(b)) with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates in connection with any such
Proceedings.
(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly
and severally responsible for maintaining for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company, as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy
of the Company, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied
if prepaid “tail” policies have been obtained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the
Effective Time, which policies provide directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six
years with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time
that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such directors and officers in coverage and
amount no greater than the policies currently in place so long as the total premiums paid would not
exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid for the Company’s directors and officers liability insurance
policies in effect as of the date hereof, it being understood that if the total premium payable for such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

(d) In the event that, during the six (6) year period after the Effective Time, either Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to cause
proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.9.
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have
under the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws or similar organizational documents in effect as of
the date of this Agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
The obligations of Parent under this Section 5.9 shall not, during the six (6) year period after the
Effective Time, be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies, except as required by Law, and then only to the minimum
extent required by Law, and unless the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification or advancement of expenses
provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing in an amount necessary,
together with the Equity Financing, to fund the Financing Amounts and to consummate the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date, including the following:
(i) maintaining in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter and not permitting any
amendment or modification to be made to, not consenting to any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, and not replacing, the Debt Commitment Letter (other than as contemplated by the Debt

replacement: (A) reduces (or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount in connection with the Debt Financing) (unless an equal amount from
alternative financing sources is then made available) to an amount, together with the Equity
Financing, less than what is necessary to fund the Financing Amounts or (B) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the
funding of any of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) delay or
prevent the Closing, (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing) materially less likely to occur or (3) materially and adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto when required pursuant to this Agreement
(provided that (x) so long as not otherwise prohibited by the other provisions of this Section 5.10,
for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; and (y) Parent shall reasonably promptly furnish to the
Company copies of any executed versions of any agreements or other documentation with respect
to such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement);

consent of the Company.

documents relating to the Debt Financing to the Company and (y) keep the Company informed in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and any material developments
with respect to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any Financing Failure Event.
(d) Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing.
(e) If any Financing Failure Event occurs, Parent shall promptly notify the Company thereof and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date,
in consultation with the Company, on terms as favorable to Parent as the terms in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including “market flex”  (if any)) or as are reasonably available for financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in the debt markets at such time, alternative debt
financing (“Debt Replacement Financing”) in an amount that when added with the Equity Financing
would be sufficient to pay the Financing Amounts. Parent shall deliver to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of all contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which any alternative source shall
have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Replacement Financing (provided that any fee letters
in connection therewith may be redacted in a manner consistent with the Debt Fee Letter provided as of

by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that

the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such courts. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment

to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will

(a) The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, (i)
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any

parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law.

such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered by the other party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving a Willful and Material
Breach; provided, however, under no circumstances shall the Company or any of its affiliates be
permitted or entitled to seek or receive both a grant of specific performance in accordance with this
Section 8.13, on the one hand, and payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination Fee or any other
monetary damages (subject to the limitations set forth herein) from Parent or any Parent Related Party,

satisfied if the Closing would occur as of such date), (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in
writing that (A) all of the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those

all of which would be satisfied if the Closing would occur as of such date) or that the Company is
willing to waive any such open conditions and (B) if specific performance is granted and the Financing
is funded, the Closing will occur, (iii) the Debt Financing (or any Debt Replacement Financing in
accordance with Section 5.10(e)) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity

Section 262. Appraisal Rights.
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds
such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor
consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant
by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected
pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately
prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either:
(i) listed on a national securities exchange or
(ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did
not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in
§ 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof
are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares
of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of
the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders;
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares
or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this
section.
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §
253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed by 2020 Amendment.]
