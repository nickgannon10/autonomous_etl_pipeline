Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the stockholders of Veoneer (the “Veoneer Stockholders”) as a part of the
solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) to be held
on December 16, 2021, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Due to public health
concerns surrounding COVID-19 and to prioritize the health and well-being of Veoneer’s employees, stockholders
and other community members, Veoneer will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual format only at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting in person.
Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the Special Meeting, Veoneer Stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on proposals (collectively, the
“Special Meeting Proposals”) to:
•
adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
Only Veoneer Stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2021 (the “Record Date”), are
entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Veoneer’s
headquarters located at Klarabergsviadukten 70, Section C6, Box 13089, SE- 103 02, Stockholm, Sweden, during
regular business hours for a period of at least ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and online at the meeting
website during the Special Meeting. To access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting
website link set forth here: www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. In order to constitute a
quorum for the conduct of business at the Special Meeting, a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer’s
common stock, par value $1.00 per share (“Veoneer Common Stock”), entitled to vote at the Special Meeting must be
present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be
treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present.
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Holders of Veoneer’s Swedish Depository Receipts (“SDRs”) are entitled to
vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they directly held Veoneer Common Stock.
Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR
held on the Record Date. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Veoneer Common
Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum
is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation
that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This
means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty percent (50%) of
the total number of outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
Abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the proposal to approve compensation that will or
may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both
proposals presented to Veoneer Stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, a bank, broker or other nominee
that holds shares in street name for a beneficial owner may not, under applicable rules, vote those shares without
specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If the beneficial owner does not provide instructions on either
proposal, then the bank, broker or other nominee will not be entitled to vote the shares at the Special Meeting and, as
a result, those shares will be deemed not present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner provides
instruction as to how the bank, broker or other nominee should vote on one proposal, but does not provide any
instruction regarding how to vote on the other proposal, then the shares will be deemed present at the Special
Meeting, the bank, broker or other nominee will vote the shares as instructed on the proposal for which it received
instruction, and the bank, broker or other nominee will not vote the shares on the other proposal, which is known as a
“broker non-vote” on that proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve compensation that will or may
become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Shares Held by Veoneer’s Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the Record Date, Veoneer’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned 420,551
shares of Veoneer Common Stock (including their vested Veoneer stock options), which represented approximately
0.4% of the shares of outstanding Veoneer Common Stock on that date (and approximately 0.4% of the outstanding
shares of Veoneer Common Stock when taking into account Veoneer stock options (the “Company Options”)). The
directors and executive officers have informed Veoneer that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Veoneer
Common Stock “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal
regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger.
Voting of Proxies
If your shares are registered in your name with Veoneer’s transfer agent, Computershare, you may cause your shares
to be voted by submitting, electronically over the internet or by phone, a proxy authorizing the voting of your shares
by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the
instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. We
encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a
touch-tone phone or the internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid
envelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your
shares according to your directions.
If you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a virtual
ballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, your vote by
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued in your name from
your broker, bank or other nominee.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of
2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” adoption of
the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. No proxy that is
specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in favor of the proposed compensation
arrangements for Veoneer’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, unless it is specifically marked
“FOR” the approval of such proposal.
If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,”
your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special
Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other
nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage you to authorize your
broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the
instructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the internet or telephone through your
broker, bank or other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, or do not attend
the Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, it will be counted as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to approve,
by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger. If you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares
on one proposal, but do not provide instructions as to the other proposal, your shares will be voted as instructed on
the one proposal and a broker non-vote will occur on the other proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to
approve, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they
directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer
Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. We encourage you to vote prior to the meeting to
ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear
Sweden AB (“Euroclear”) or with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to
vote over the internet by following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR
holders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes
from their clients, aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set
forth in the proxy materials received by regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to contact
your broker to vote.
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically.
Please submit your proxy via the internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If
you do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and
returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special
Meeting in a virtual format. If you properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy
holders will vote your shares as you have directed.
The Magna Merger Agreement has been terminated and the proposed merger with Magna has been abandoned.
Therefore, the special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders to adopt the Magna Merger Agreement was cancelled and
any proxy given to vote at that special meeting will not be counted at the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger
Agreement with Qualcomm and SSW or at all. Failure to return or submit your proxy or vote at the Special Meeting in
accordance with the instructions provided in this Proxy Statement will have the effect of voting your shares
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the internet,
by telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or
superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no
direction is indicated on a proxy card, such shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the enclosed proxy
card according to the recommendation of the board of directors of Veoneer (the “Board”) “FOR” both of the Special
Meeting Proposals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Record Date
The Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting
is November 12, 2021. Only Veoneer Stockholders who held shares of Veoneer Common Stock of record at the close of
business on November 12, 2021, are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting and any adjournment or postponement of
the Special Meeting.
Quorum
A quorum is necessary to conduct business at the Special Meeting. A quorum requires the presence at the Special
Meeting of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote generally at the meeting
considered at the Special Meeting, via the Veoneer meeting website or represented by proxy.
For purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, all shares that are present will count towards the quorum,
which will include proxies received but marked as abstentions. Because both proposals presented to stockholders
will be considered non-discretionary, shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name for a beneficial
owner will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if the beneficial owner provides no instructions regarding
how those shares should be voted. As a result, such shares will be deemed not present at the Special Meeting and
not count for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of shares provides voting
instructions on either or both proposals, then the bank, broker or other nominee is entitled to vote such shares as
instructed and they will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and count towards the quorum.

Agreement, Veoneer Stockholders should be aware that certain of Veoneer’s non-employee directors and executive
officers for purposes of this Proxy Statement have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to,
those of Veoneer Stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other
7TABLE OF CONTENTS
matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be
adopted by Veoneer Stockholders. These interests include the following:
•
the accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested restricted stock units (the “Company RSUs”) and Veoneer
performance-based restricted stock units (the “Company PSUs”), and conversion of the Company Options,
Company RSUs and Company PSUs into the Merger Consideration;
•
the eligibility of certain named executive officers to receive enhanced severance payments and benefits
under their respective employment or change in control severance agreements in connection with the
Merger;
•
the eligibility of certain executive officers of the Company to receive severance payments under their
respective employment agreements in connection with a qualifying termination of employment;
•
the entitlement of certain executive officers to receive the balance of such executive’s Veoneer Non-
Qualified Retirement Savings Plan account balance, distributed in a single lump sum payment within sixty
(60) days following the closing of the Merger under the terms of the plan;
•
the possibility of receiving a retention bonus payable based on continued employment as of certain
vesting dates including the “Closing Date” (as defined in Section 2.2 of the Merger Agreement) of the
Merger and the 60th day following the Closing Date, as permitted by the Merger Agreement; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving
Corporation.

Treatment of Company Options
Each Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically and without any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested)
and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the Merger
Consideration over (b) the per-share exercise price for such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of
shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of Veoneer
Common Stock of such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Treatment of Company RSUs
Each Company RSU which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required under

Company RSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in respect of dividend equivalent units credited
thereon (if any)) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Treatment of Company PSUs
Each Company PSU which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by
applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such Company
PSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in respect of dividend equivalent units credited thereon (if
any)) with performance measured (x) based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level
of performance for any performance periods that have concluded prior to October 4, 2021, and (y) based on the
greater of attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the target level of performance or at the actual level of
performance (as determined by the Board) as measured through the Closing Date, for any open performance periods

The Acquiring Parties represented to Veoneer that as of the date of the Merger Agreement they have access to, and
at the Effective Time will have, sufficient funds available to fund all amounts required to be paid by the Acquiring
Parties and/or Merger Sub for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Completion of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.
Qualcomm Actions (page 84)
Qualcomm has agreed to take all actions necessary to cause SSW and Merger Sub (i) to perform their respective
obligations under the Merger Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement and (ii) to have available sufficient funds to satisfy the required merger payments when due and
payable, including the payment of the Merger Consideration when required in accordance with the Merger
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, if (x) either SSW or Merger Sub has failed to perform any of the
obligations applicable to such party in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger
Agreement and (y) Veoneer has delivered written notice to Qualcomm of any such failure to perform by SSW or
Merger Sub, as applicable, then, promptly after its receipt of such notice, Qualcomm shall take all action necessary to
satisfy (on behalf of SSW and/or Merger Sub) such obligations, including, if required, making any necessary
payments in satisfaction of the required merger payments when due and payable and delivering the Merger
Consideration when required in accordance with the Merger Agreement, in each case, on behalf of SSW and Merger
Sub.
Interim Financing (page 84)
Qualcomm will provide for a loan facility from Qualcomm (or a third party and guaranteed by Qualcomm) providing
financing in order to satisfy the cash flow and liquidity needs of the Arriver Business and assets related to the
Arriver Business in a manner consistent with Veoneer’s ordinary course of business consistent with Veoneer’s past
practice to the extent requested by the Company for the quarter commencing April 1, 2022, and each of the two
subsequent quarters of $120,000,000 per quarter (up to $360,000,000 in the aggregate) which amounts may in certain
circumstances be forgiven with an additional $120,000,000 (for the first quarter of 2023) to be provided if either party
extends the final Outside Date to April 4, 2023.

The receipt of cash by a “U.S. Holder” (as defined in the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
of the Merger-U.S. Holders” beginning on page 84 of this Proxy Statement) in exchange for shares of Veoneer
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general,
such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined
separately for each block of shares of Veoneer Common Stock (that is, shares acquired for the same cost in a single
transaction). Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.
Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on
capital gain will generally apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.
Any gain realized by a “Non-U.S. Holder” (as defined in the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations of the Merger-Non-U.S. Holders” beginning on page 84 of this Proxy Statement) pursuant to the
Merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain will generally be subject to U.S.
9TABLE OF CONTENTS
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a United States person as defined under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”), and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such
gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate
under an applicable tax treaty); or
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-three
(183) days or more in the taxable year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which
case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate
under an applicable tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the Non-
U.S. Holder.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the Merger, see the section entitled
“The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger” beginning on page 84 of this Proxy Statement.
Holders of Veoneer Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the
Merger to their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of any state, local, foreign or other
tax laws.

Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (“HSR
Act”) has expired or been terminated. Consummation of the Merger is also conditioned on approvals being obtained
or applicable waiting periods having expired or been terminated pursuant to the investment screening laws of France,
Germany and Italy, and no governmental authority of the United States, the People’s Republic of China, France,
Germany or Italy having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect
and has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger.
We currently expect to obtain all antitrust and other regulatory approvals that are required for the completion of the
Merger in 2022.

Between October 29 and November 10, 2021, three (3) complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and one (1) complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York against Veoneer and its directors: Stein v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08869 (S.D.N.Y.);
Whitfield v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-09177 (S.D.N.Y.); Anderson v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-
09190 (S.D.N.Y.); and Amodwala v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06240 (E.D.N.Y.). The complaints each allege
that the preliminary Proxy Statement issued in connection with the proposed Merger between Veoneer and Qualcomm
omitted material information which rendered the preliminary Proxy Statement incomplete and misleading. Specifically,
the complaints allege that the preliminary Proxy Statement failed to disclose material information regarding Veoneer’s
financial projections, Rothschild’s and Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses, and additional information regarding
prior work Morgan Stanley performed for Veoneer and Qualcomm.
Each complaint seeks, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction unless and until additional disclosures
are issued; and, if the Merger closes, damages. The defendants believe the complaints are without merit. It is possible
additional lawsuits may be filed between the date of this Proxy Statement and consummation of the Merger.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay
consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Veoneer, including any costs associated with the
indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
governmental authority in the U.S. or other specified foreign jurisdictions shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect and has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering
illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an
injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent
the Merger from being consummated, or from being consummated within the expected time frame.

immediately cease and cause to be immediately terminated all soliciting activities, discussions, negotiations and
access to nonpublic information of Veoneer with, to or by any third party relating to any Competing Proposal or any

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the termination
provisions of the Merger Agreement, Veoneer agreed that it will not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and each of its
and their respective directors, officers and controlled representatives not to, and shall instruct its other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any Competing Proposal or any inquiries
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal;

expected to lead to a Competing Proposal;
•
grant any waiver of, terminate, amend or release any standstill or similar obligation of any third party with
respect to Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries (and Veoneer shall enforce any and all such provisions;
provided that if the Board determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Veoneer may waive any such standstill or similar
agreement to the extent necessary to permit the person bound by such provision or agreement to make a
Competing Proposal to the Board);
•
take any action to make the provisions of any takeover law, or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in Veoneer’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a Competing Proposal (including approving any transaction under, or a third party
becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL); or
•
approve or recommend, or allow Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding with respect to any

longer time as required by applicable law (such period, the “Continuation Period”), Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable,
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to, provide each employee of Veoneer
or any of its subsidiaries who remain employees of the Acquiring Parties, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
affiliates following the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) at least the same base salary and wage

required pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or applicable law) and retention or change in control
payments or awards) to the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the

and benefits to each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during the Continuation Period that are
no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to the Acquiring Parties simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement (the “Company

Notwithstanding the above, to the extent a Continuing Employee is employed in a jurisdiction where applicable law
requires different treatment of such Continuing Employee’s compensation or benefits entitlements, or such
Continuing Employee’s terms of employment are governed by a collective bargaining, works council or similar
agreement, SSW or Qualcomm, as applicable, will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective

Veoneer Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “VNE” and its SDRs are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm
under the symbol “VNE SDB.” As of November 12, 2021, there were 111,997,942 shares of Veoneer Common Stock
outstanding, held by approximately 1,308 stockholders of record.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of the Merger, neither Veoneer nor any of its subsidiaries may authorize, declare, pay or make
any dividend or other distribution, payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to Veoneer securities or

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Veoneer Stockholders and the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall not have their shares converted into the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of Veoneer Common Stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective date of the
Merger, and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the Merger
Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the “fair value” of the
shares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the Court
of Chancery. Veoneer Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares
as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the $37.00 per share
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
18TABLE OF CONTENTS
Veoneer Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Veoneer Common Stock
must fully comply with Section 262 of the DGCL, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Veoneer a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares
before the Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date
of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of
doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should
not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not
vote its shares. Only a holder of record of shares of Veoneer Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for
the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Veoneer Common Stock
held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the
record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you
hold your shares of Veoneer Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or the other nominee.

A:
The Special Meeting will take place on December 16, 2021, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Due to public health

Q:
What happened to the proposed merger with Magna and the related special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders?
A:
On October 4, 2021, we terminated the Magna Merger Agreement in order to enter into the Merger Agreement
with Qualcomm, SSW and Merger Sub, and accordingly, we also cancelled the special meeting of Veoneer
Stockholders in connection with the approval of the Magna Merger Agreement. Concurrently with the
termination of the Magna Merger Agreement and pursuant thereto, Qualcomm paid to Magna the $110,000,000
Termination Fee in satisfaction of Veoneer’s obligations under the Magna Merger Agreement.
On October 4, 2021, following termination of the Merger Agreement, Veoneer entered into the Merger Agreement
following a determination by the Board that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger-Background of the Merger”) constituted a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger-Background of the Merger”).
20TABLE OF CONTENTS
For more information regarding the background of the merger, see the section entitled “The Merger-Background
of the Merger” beginning on page 39 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
I have already given my proxy to vote my shares at the special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders in connection
with the approval of the Magna Merger Agreement. Do I need to give my proxy or vote my shares again?
A:
Yes. The Magna Merger Agreement has been terminated and the proposed merger with Magna has been
abandoned. Therefore, the special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders to adopt the Magna Merger Agreement was
cancelled and any proxy given to vote at that special meeting will not be counted at the Special Meeting to
adopt the Merger Agreement with Qualcomm and SSW or at all. Failure to return or submit your proxy or vote at
the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement will have the effect of
voting your shares “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote
electronically.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Veoneer?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Veoneer by the Acquiring Parties through the Merger of Merger Sub
with and into Veoneer pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is
approved by the requisite number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under
the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Veoneer, with Veoneer
continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Veoneer will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of SSW and you will no longer own shares of Veoneer Common Stock. Veoneer expects to delist its
securities from the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm and de-register its Veoneer Common Stock under the Exchange
Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Veoneer would no longer be a publicly traded
company, and Veoneer will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $37.00 in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Veoneer Common Stock that
you own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL
with respect to such shares. For example, if you own one hundred (100) shares of Veoneer Common Stock, you
will be entitled to receive $3,700.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in
exchange for your one hundred (100) shares of Veoneer Common Stock. In either case, your shares will be
canceled and you will not own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the Surviving Corporation or the Acquiring
Parties. Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs will be treated in accordance with the Depository Agreement.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2021, are entitled to notice of the
Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your
shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-routine
matters,” your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the
Special Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name or if you are a holder of SDRs
are described under the question “How may I vote?” below.
Q:
Are holders of Veoneer’s SDRs entitled to vote?
A:
Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if
they directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share
of Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. We encourage you to vote prior to the
meeting to ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at
Euroclear or with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the
internet by following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
SDR holders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their clients and to
retrieve votes from their clients, aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and Code (and
other actions) set forth in the proxy materials received by regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we
encourage you to contact your broker to vote.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
For Veoneer Stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the Special Meeting and are a stockholder of
record, you may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
•
by voting over the internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name and you do not
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting
Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority
to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in
street name, your broker, bank or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy
Statement. SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear or with a Swedish nominee will receive
proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the internet by following the instructions set forth in
the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR holders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail
an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes from their clients, aggregate these and vote for their
clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set forth in the proxy materials received by regular
mail. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the
Special Meeting Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form.
If you submit your proxy by internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Veoneer Common Stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot, you are encouraged to vote your shares of
Veoneer Common Stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid legal proxy to vote
shares which you beneficially own and wish to change your vote, you may still vote your shares of Veoneer
Common Stock by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the
Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
Each holder of Veoneer Common Stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the
Special Meeting for each share of Veoneer Common Stock that such holder owned as of the Record Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Due to public health concerns surrounding COVID-19 and to prioritize the health and well-being of Veoneer’s
employees, stockholders and other community members, Veoneer will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual
meeting format only on the virtual meeting website. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically
in person. Holders of SDRs must vote in accordance with the instructions they receive with their proxy materials,
but may attend the virtual Special Meeting as a guest at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM.
Once admitted to the Special Meeting, stockholders may vote their shares and view a list of stockholders by

postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format. We
encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically. If you properly and timely submit your
proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you have directed. If you attend the
Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by virtual ballot, your vote by virtual ballot will revoke any

proxy previously submitted. If you hold your shares in street name, because you are not the stockholder of
record, you may not vote your shares by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting in a virtual format unless you
request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank, broker, bank or other nominee.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Veoneer Common Stock prior to the
announcement of the Merger?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $37.00 per share represents a premium of:
•
approximately 85.6% over the closing stock price on July 22, 2021, the last trading day prior to the
announcement of Magna Merger Agreement;
•
approximately 73.2% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Veoneer Common Stock
during the one-month period ended July 22, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of Magna
Merger Agreement; and
•
approximately 18% over the $31.25 per share price contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Veoneer encourages you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement, including all documents incorporated by
reference into the accompanying Proxy Statement, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety. Then as
promptly as possible, follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to submit your proxy electronically
over the internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. We encourage all
stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically. Holders of SDRs must vote in accordance with the
instructions they receive with their proxy materials. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a touch-tone
phone or the internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope
provided. If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee
has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. Please do not send your stock certificate(s)
with your proxy card. See “How may I vote?” in this section of the Proxy Statement for more information.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
On October 4, 2021, the Board, after considering various factors, including those described the section entitled
“The Merger-Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 53 of this Proxy
Statement, and after consultation with Veoneer’s independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i)
approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the
Merger, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Veoneer and Veoneer Stockholders and (iii) resolved
to recommend that the stockholders of Veoneer vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including in the Merger; and “FOR”
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by
Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you
will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the paying agent in order to
receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Veoneer Common Stock represented by
such stock certificate(s). You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the
Merger Consideration to which you are entitled upon the consummation of the Merger. If you hold your shares
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank or other nominee for instructions as to how to effect the
surrender of your shares of Veoneer Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Please do not send in your stock certificates now.
Q:
If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares of
Veoneer Common Stock?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the closing of the Merger will
include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an
affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to
post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Veoneer Stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Veoneer Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Veoneer Common Stock.
Instead, Veoneer will remain an independent public company, Veoneer Common Stock and SDRs will continue to
be listed and traded on the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm, respectively, and registered under the Exchange Act,
and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Veoneer may be required to pay
the Acquiring Parties the Termination Fee of $110,000,000. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under other
specified circumstances, the Acquiring Parties may be required to pay Veoneer the Reverse Termination Fee of
$225,000,000. Further, under specified circumstances Veoneer may be required to reimburse Qualcomm for the
$110,000,000 that Qualcomm paid to Magna in connection with the termination of the Magna Merger Agreement.
See the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees; Expenses” beginning on page 110 of
this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Do any of Veoneer’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ from
those of Veoneer Stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Veoneer’s directors and executive officers for purposes of this Proxy
Statement may have interests in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Veoneer
Stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests
existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in
approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted
by Veoneer Stockholders. For a description of the interests of Veoneer’s directors and executive officers in the
Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the
Merger” beginning on page 76 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Veoneer’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger, commonly referred to as “golden parachute” compensation.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special
Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the
proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if
the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of
outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with
24
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Merger. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation
that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
As of November 12, 2021, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there
were approximately 111,997,942 shares of Veoneer Common Stock issued and outstanding. Each holder of
Veoneer Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Veoneer Common Stock owned by such holder as of
the Record Date.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy
card have been sent directly to you by Veoneer. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by
proxy, which involves granting your voting rights directly to Veoneer or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at
the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of
those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other
nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial
owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Without your
voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your broker, bank or
other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.
Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if
they directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share
of Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. We encourage you to vote prior to the
meeting to ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at
meeting to ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at
Euroclear or with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the
internet by following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR holders
acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes from
their clients, aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set
forth in the proxy materials received by regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to
contact your broker to vote.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Veoneer
Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special
Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Veoneer
Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Jan Carlson and Lars Sjöbring and each of
them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following
ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
25
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Lars Sjöbring, Veoneer’s Corporate Secretary, at Veoneer’s
mailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you
have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote
by virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Your latest dated proxy card, internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee.
Q:
If a Veoneer Stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting. Holders of SDRs must
vote in accordance with the instructions they receive with their proxy materials.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The holders of a majority in voting power of all issued and outstanding Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote
generally at the Special Meeting, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
business at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 111,997,942 shares
of Veoneer Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a properly executed proxy
by internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition, abstentions will be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Because both proposals presented to stockholders will be
considered non-discretionary, shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name for a beneficial
owner will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if the beneficial owner provides no instructions
regarding how those shares should be voted. As a result, such shares will be deemed not present at the Special
Meeting and not count for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of shares provides
voting instructions on either or both proposals, then the bank, broker or other nominee is entitled to vote such
shares as instructed and they will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and count towards the quorum. As
a result, at least 55,998,972 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not
present, the holders of a majority in voting power of the Veoneer Common Stock, present or represented by
proxy, and entitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting
pursuant to Veoneer’s bylaws.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.
For Veoneer Stockholders of record: Please call Georgeson LLC (“Georgeson”) at (866) 741-9588.
For holders in “street name”: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.
For SDR holders: SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear or with a Swedish nominee will
receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the internet by following the instructions set
forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR holders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged
to mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes from their clients, aggregate these and vote for
their clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set forth in the proxy materials received by
regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to contact your broker to vote.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Veoneer Common Stock after the close of business on
the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
consummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Veoneer Common Stock after the close of business on the
Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the provision of a proxy) are
made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies
Veoneer in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Veoneer Common Stock,
but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer
your shares of Veoneer Common Stock after the close of business on the Record Date, you are encouraged to
complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the internet or telephone.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and
multiple proxy cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote via the internet or telephone (or complete, date, sign and return) with respect to each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive. Holders of SDRs must vote in accordance with the instructions they
receive with their proxy materials.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Veoneer Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective
Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Veoneer Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective Time,
you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares of Veoneer Common Stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of
Veoneer Common Stock through the Effective Time.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
The cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Veoneer. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit
proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these
directors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding this Proxy
Statement and related materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners
of Veoneer Common Stock. Veoneer has retained Georgeson as its proxy solicitor. Georgeson will solicit proxies
in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. Under our agreement with
Georgeson, Georgeson will receive an estimated fee not to exceed $25,000 plus reimbursement of its reasonable,
out-of-pocket expenses for its services. In addition, Georgeson and certain related persons will be indemnified
against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Veoneer has retained The Carideo Group, Inc. to serve as independent inspector of elections in connection with
the Special Meeting. Veoneer intends to notify stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by issuing a
press release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Veoneer Common Stock for cash pursuant to
the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Veoneer Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger” beginning on page 84 of this Proxy Statement) who
exchanges shares of Veoneer Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled
“The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger” beginning on page 84 of this Proxy
Statement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have certain
connections with the United States.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger” beginning on page 84 of this
Proxy Statement.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Veoneer equity awards receive in the Merger?
A:
In general, holders of outstanding Veoneer equity awards will receive the cash value of the award, based on the
Merger Consideration. If the Merger is completed:
Each Company Option, whether or not vested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will
automatically and without any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if
unvested) and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and
subject to any withholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
(a) the Merger Consideration over (b) the per-share exercise price for such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the
total number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such Company Option. If the exercise price per
share of Veoneer Common Stock of such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof.
Each Company RSU, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Veoneer Common Stock underlying such Company RSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in
respect of dividend equivalent units credited thereon (if any)) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Each Company PSU, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Veoneer
Common Stock underlying such Company PSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in respect of
dividend equivalent units credited thereon (if any)) with performance measured (x) based on the attainment of
the applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance for any performance periods that have
concluded prior to October 4, 2021, and (y) based on the greater of attainment of the applicable performance
metrics at the target level of performance or at the actual level of performance (as determined by the Board) as
measured through the Closing Date for any open performance periods after October 4, 2021, multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Veoneer equity award that may be granted to employees after October 4,
2021, will have terms and conditions that are consented to by the Acquiring Parties.
For additional information regarding the treatment of Veoneer’s outstanding equity awards, see the section
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Outstanding Company Equity Awards”
beginning on page 89 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Veoneer and the Acquiring Parties are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. At this
time, the timing of receipt of necessary regulatory approvals is difficult to predict. However, assuming the timely
receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Veoneer Stockholders of the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in 2022. See the section entitled “Terms
of the Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on 107 of this Proxy Statement.

Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. See the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 30 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Veoneer Stockholders and the Merger is consummated, stockholders
who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his,
her or its demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall not have their shares converted into
the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Veoneer
Stockholders are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any elements
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest based to be paid
upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery. Veoneer
Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning
on page 18 of this Proxy Statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is
reproduced and attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement.
Q:
What if during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing
the virtual meeting website?
A:
If Veoneer experiences technical difficulties during the Special Meeting (e.g., a temporary or prolonged power
outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Veoneer will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the virtual
meeting website.
Technical support will be ready to assist you with any individual technical difficulties you may have accessing
the virtual meeting website. Contact information for technical support will appear on the virtual meeting login
page prior to the start of the Special Meeting.

"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Proxy Statement may include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the Merger. In
this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and
financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,”
“see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” “forecast,” “project,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.
The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature
address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed
Merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed Merger or to
make any filing or take other action required to consummate such Merger in a timely matter or at all. The inclusion of
such statements should not be regarded as a representation that any plans, estimates or expectations will be
achieved. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to: (i) the Merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; (ii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to
the consummation of the transaction, including approval of the Merger by Veoneer Stockholders and the receipt of
certain governmental and regulatory approvals on the terms or at the timing expected; (iii) the occurrence of any
event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; (iv) operating
costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships
with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) may be greater than expected; (v) risks related to diverting
management attention from ongoing business operations; (vi) the business of Veoneer may suffer as a result of
uncertainty surrounding the Merger or the potential adverse changes to business relationships resulting from the
proposed Merger; and (vii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Veoneer or the
Acquiring Parties related to the Merger Agreement or the transaction contemplated thereby. The foregoing list of
factors is not exhaustive. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the
forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial
loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Veoneer’s
financial condition, results of operations, credit rating or liquidity.
You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties relating to Veoneer
described in Veoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recently completed fiscal year, and other reports

This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the Veoneer Stockholders as a part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held on December 16, 2021, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof. Due to public health concerns surrounding COVID-19 and to prioritize the health and well-
being of Veoneer’s employees, stockholders and other community members, Veoneer will hold the Special Meeting in
a virtual format only at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM. You will not be able to attend the Special

At the Special Meeting, Veoneer Stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on proposals to:

Only Veoneer Stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2021, are entitled to notice of the
Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Veoneer’s headquarters located
at Klarabergsviadukten 70, Section C6, Box 13089, SE- 103 02, Stockholm, Sweden, during regular business hours for a
period of at least ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and online at the meeting website during the Special
Meeting. To access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting website link set forth here:
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. In order to constitute a
quorum for the conduct of business at the Special Meeting, a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common
Stock entitled to vote generally at the Special Meeting must be present or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to shares held in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee generally has the discretionary
authority to vote uninstructed shares on “routine” matters, but cannot vote such uninstructed shares on “non-
routine” matters. A “broker non-vote” will occur if your broker, bank or other nominee cannot vote your shares on a
particular matter because it has not received instructions from you and does not have discretionary voting authority
on that matter or because your broker, bank or other nominee chooses not to vote on a matter for which it does have
discretionary voting authority. Because both proposals presented to stockholders will be considered non-
discretionary, shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name for a beneficial owner will not be entitled
to vote at the Special Meeting if the beneficial owner provides no instructions regarding how those shares should be
voted. As a result, such shares will be deemed not present at the Special Meeting and not count for purposes of
establishing a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of shares provides voting instructions on either or both
proposals, then the bank, broker or other nominee is entitled to vote such shares as instructed and they will be
deemed present at the Special Meeting and count towards the quorum.
Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they
directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer
Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. We encourage you to vote prior to the meeting to
ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear or
with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the internet by
following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR holders acting as non-
Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes from their clients,
aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set forth in the proxy
materials received by regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to contact your broker to vote.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer
Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs
is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon,
which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to
approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become
payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated thereby, including the Merger, will be approved if the
number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding
shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be
counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. Abstentions will also be counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger, but broker non-votes will have no effect on such proposal.

At the close of business on the Record Date, Veoneer’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned 420,551
shares of Veoneer Common Stock (including their vested Veoneer stock options), which represented approximately
0.4% of the shares of outstanding Veoneer Common Stock on that date (and approximately 0.4% of the outstanding
shares of Veoneer Common Stock when taking into account Company Options). The directors and executive officers
have informed Veoneer that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Veoneer Common Stock “FOR” the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will
or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Voting of Proxies",44,44
"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Voting of Proxies,"Voting of Proxies
If your shares are registered in your name with Veoneer’s transfer agent, Computershare, you may cause your shares
to be voted by submitting, electronically over the internet or by phone, a proxy authorizing the voting of your shares
by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the
instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. We
encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a
touch-tone phone or the internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid
envelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your
shares according to your directions.
If you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a virtual
ballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, your vote by
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued in your name from
your broker, bank or other nominee.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of
the stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” adoption of
the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. No proxy that is
specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in favor of the proposed compensation
arrangements for Veoneer’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, unless it is specifically marked
“FOR” the approval of such proposal.
If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,”
your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special
Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other
nominee has
32TABLE OF CONTENTS
enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank or
other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the instructions
provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the internet or telephone through your broker, bank or
other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, or do not attend the Special
Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, it will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. If you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares on one
proposal, but do not provide instructions as to the other proposal, your shares will be voted as instructed on the one
proposal and a broker non-vote will occur on the other proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve, by
non-binding advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers
in connection with the Merger.
Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they
directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer

You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you attend
the Special Meeting in a virtual format, by voting by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares as a
record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Lars Sjöbring, Veoneer’s Corporate Secretary, at Veoneer’s
address above before the Special Meeting, which states that you have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote by ballot at
the Special Meeting for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Please note that to be effective, your new proxy card, internet or telephonic voting instructions or written notice of
revocation must be received by Veoneer’s Secretary prior to the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your voting instructions
by following the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee. You may also vote at the Special Meeting by
ballot if you register in advance to attend the Special Meeting following the procedures described below and if you
provide a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.
SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear or with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by
regular mail and are urged to vote over the internet by following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such
SDR holder receives. SDR holders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their
clients and to retrieve votes from their clients, aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and

encourage you to contact your broker to vote.

If a quorum is not present or if there are not sufficient votes for the approval of the merger proposal, Veoneer expects
that the Special Meeting will be adjourned by the chairman of the Special Meeting pursuant to Veoneer’s bylaws to
solicit additional proxies in accordance with the Merger Agreement. At any subsequent reconvening of the Special
Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the manner in which such proxies would have been voted at
the original convening of the Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been validly revoked or withdrawn
prior to the subsequent meeting.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting

For purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, all shares that are present will count towards the quorum,
which will include proxies received but marked as abstentions. Because both proposals presented to stockholders
will be considered non-discretionary, shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name for a beneficial
owner will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if the beneficial owner provides no instructions regarding
how those shares should be voted. As a result, such shares will be deemed not present at the Special Meeting and
not count for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of shares provides voting
instructions on either or both proposals, then the bank, broker or other nominee is entitled to vote such shares as
instructed and they will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and count towards the quorum.

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Veoneer Stockholders and the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall not have their shares converted into the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Veoneer Stockholders will be entitled to have their
shares of Veoneer Common Stock appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount

determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery. Veoneer Stockholders who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would
receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to Veoneer
before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, you must not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in
favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and you must continue to hold the shares of Veoneer Common
Stock of record through the effective date of the Merger. Your failure to fully comply with the procedures specified
under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights
are described in further detail in this Proxy Statement in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page
118 of this Proxy Statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and
attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares of Veoneer Common Stock through a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other
nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such broker, bank or
other nominee.

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Veoneer Stockholders and certain other conditions to the consummation of
the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Veoneer, pursuant to the DGCL, with
Veoneer continuing under the name “Veoneer, Inc.” as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Veoneer
will become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of SSW and Veoneer Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded.
In addition, Veoneer’s securities will be delisted from the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm and deregistered under the
Exchange Act, in each case, in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and Veoneer will no longer file
periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own
any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Holders of Veoneer’s SDRs will be treated in accordance
with the Depository Agreement.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary (or at such later time as
the Acquiring Parties, Merger Sub and Veoneer may agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger).",50,50

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Qualcomm, SSW and Merger Sub entered into the
Investment and Separation Matters Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which, following
the closing of the Merger, the Non-Arriver Business will be extracted from Veoneer. Immediately thereafter the Arriver
Business will be sold to Qualcomm (or its designated affiliate) by way of the Arriver Sale.
The foregoing description of the Investment and Separation Matters Agreement does not purport to be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Investment and Separation Matters Agreement, a

"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Effect on Veoneer if the Merger is Not Consummated,"Effect on Veoneer if the Merger is Not Consummated
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Veoneer Stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other
reason, Veoneer Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Veoneer Common Stock. Instead,
Veoneer will remain an independent public company, Veoneer Common Stock and SDRs will continue to be listed and
traded on the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm, respectively, and registered under the Exchange Act, and Veoneer will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock. In addition, if the Merger is not
consummated, Veoneer expects that Veoneer’s management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in
which it is being operated today.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the
Merger not to be consummated, it is possible that the price of Veoneer Common Stock will decline significantly. If that
were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Veoneer Common Stock would return to the price at which it
trades as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of Veoneer Common Stock. If the Merger is not consummated, the
Board will continue to evaluate and review Veoneer’s business operations, properties, dividend policy and
capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify
strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Veoneer Stockholders
or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction
acceptable to Veoneer will be offered or that Veoneer’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be
adversely impacted.

In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Veoneer may be required to pay the
Acquiring Parties the Termination Fee of $110,000,000. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under other specified
circumstances, the Acquiring Parties may be required to pay Veoneer the Reverse Termination Fee of $225,000,000.
Further, under specified circumstances Veoneer may be required to reimburse Qualcomm for the $110,000,000 that

Since Veoneer became an independent public company as a result of its separation from Autoliv, Inc., and the
distribution of Veoneer by Autoliv, Inc. in June 2018, as part of Veoneer’s strategic planning process, the Board has
regularly reviewed and discussed with Veoneer’s senior management and its advisors, including Morgan Stanley,
which advised Autoliv, Inc. in its separation of Veoneer into an independent public company, Veoneer’s performance,
business strategy and competitive position in the automotive technology industry. These reviews and discussions
have focused on topics including, among others, growth strategies, potential divestitures, commercial collaborations
and joint ventures with third parties and potential acquisitions by Veoneer, as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen
Veoneer’s overall business and enhance stockholder value. The Board has also periodically reviewed with senior
management and external advisors, including Morgan Stanley, the automotive technology industry landscape and
trends and has discussed the possibility of an acquisition of Veoneer. In addition, in an effort to enhance
preparedness in the event of potential strategic opportunities or activity, the Board formally engaged Morgan Stanley
as its financial advisor in October 2018 to advise Veoneer regarding strategic and financial matters, and members of
Veoneer’s senior management have from time to time met with representatives of Morgan Stanley and other
investment banks and advisory firms, including Rothschild & Co, to discuss dynamics of the automotive industry
and potential strategic alternatives that Veoneer could consider.
Following a strategic review initially launched in April 2019, in light of the significant opportunity for future growth in
the Active Safety industry, accompanied with increasing competition in that sector and the resulting need for scale
and significant up-front investment capital and research and development, Veoneer made a decision, after
consultation with its advisors, including Morgan Stanley, to narrow the focus of its standalone strategic plan to the
commercialization of Active Safety and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In pursuit of that goal, (i) in May 2019,
Veoneer raised capital in an underwritten public offering of $420 million of Veoneer Common Stock and $207 million
aggregate principal amount of 4.00% convertible senior notes due in 2024, with Morgan Stanley acting as lead book-
running manager for such offerings, and (ii) Veoneer elected to exit the brake systems business, which exit was
substantially completed in 2020, and to dissolve Zenuity, Veoneer’s software joint venture with Volvo Cars. At the
same time, as part of Veoneer’s ongoing strategic planning process, representatives of Veoneer have, in the ordinary
course and from time to time, discussed with various companies in the automotive sector potential commercial
partnerships and strategic collaboration opportunities that might expand their respective businesses, improve their
respective customer offerings and create value for Veoneer Stockholders.
In mid-2019, Veoneer was contacted by an entity that indicated preliminary interest in pursuing a potential strategic
transaction with Veoneer; however following limited preliminary due diligence and preliminary discussion, that entity
did not make a proposal for a transaction, and discussions were terminated in early September 2019. On June 28, 2019,
Veoneer entered into a non-disclosure agreement with a standstill provision, with customary fallaways and the ability
to make confidential proposals to the Company, and to provide such entity with access to limited non-public financial
information on Veoneer.
39TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 10, 2019, Mr. Jan Carlson, Chief Executive Officer of Veoneer and Chairman of the Board, met with Mr.
Donald Walker, then Chief Executive Officer of Magna at an industry conference, Mr. Walker indicated that Magna
would be interested in exploring a potential transaction with Veoneer.
During the last several weeks in September 2019, Mr. Carlson had several follow-up conversations with Mr. Walker
and representatives from Magna during which Magna provided its preliminary views on the strategic benefits of a
potential transaction involving Veoneer and Magna, and described the information Magna would need to further
develop its views on such a potential transaction. In the course of Mr. Carlson’s regular communications with
members of the Board, Mr. Carlson updated the Board on Magna’s indication of interest in a potential transaction
with Veoneer. Mr. Walker confirmed Magna’s interest in a letter to Mr. Carlson dated October 3, 2019. On October 4,
2019, Mr. Carlson informed the directors of the receipt of Magna’s letter. Messrs. Carlson and Walker agreed that
Veoneer and Magna would enter into a non-disclosure agreement as a pre-condition to Veoneer providing
confidential information to Magna. On October 9, 2019, Veoneer entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Magna,
which did not include a standstill provision, to provide Magna with access to limited non-public financial information
on Veoneer.
On October 10, 2019, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Nishant Batra, then Chief Technology Officer of Veoneer, met with Mr.
Walker and Mr. Swamy Kotagiri, then Chief Technology Officer of Magna, to discuss the general strategic landscape
in which both companies operate, including potential challenges and opportunities for their respective businesses.
Over the course of the following week, representatives of Veoneer met with and provided representatives of Magna
with limited non-public financial information on Veoneer responsive to select requests sent from Magna. Mr. Walker
followed up on the additional information provided with an email on October 17, 2019, confirming Magna’s interest in
a transaction and requesting additional financial information to support Magna in submitting an indication of
interest. Over the next two weeks Veoneer provided the requested information.
On October 22, 2019, the Board held an informational session to receive an update from Mr. Carlson on the most
recent communication from Magna and provide an overview of the limited financial information being made available
to Magna to support Magna in submitting an indication of interest.
On October 31, 2019, Mr. Walker sent to Mr. Carlson a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for Magna to
acquire all of Veoneer’s outstanding equity at a value of $18.00-19.25 per share (“October 2019 Proposal”).
On November 6 and November 7, 2019, the Board held meetings, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co were present, to consider the unsolicited October 2019
Proposal from Magna. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co provided their preliminary
perspectives on the value indicated by such proposal. After discussion, the Board determined that the October 2019
Proposal did not provide adequate basis for further engagement. As such, the Board instructed Veoneer’s senior
management to convey such message to Magna. On November 8, 2019, as instructed by the Board, Mr. Carlson
contacted Mr. Walker to convey Veoneer’s response, and later that day sent a written response to Magna reflecting
such decision. Messrs. Carlson and Walker agreed that the parties would terminate discussions and proceed with
executing their respective standalone strategic plans.
Over the course of the following twelve months, Veoneer continued to execute its standalone strategic plan, including
executing definitive agreements to exit the brake systems business and dissolve the Zenuity joint venture with Volvo
Cars.
During the same period, representatives from Qualcomm and Veoneer engaged in numerous discussions regarding
potential opportunities for commercial collaborations between Veoneer and Qualcomm, including regarding the
development of the Arriver Business. Qualcomm and Veoneer entered into a confidentiality agreement in June 2020 in
connection with these commercial collaboration discussions. On August 27, 2020, Veoneer and Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc. (“QTI”), a subsidiary of Qualcomm, announced their decision to collaborate on the delivery of
scalable ADAS and AD solutions, powered by Veoneer’s next-generation perception and driving policy software
stack and the Qualcomm® Snapdragon Ride™ ADAS/AD scalable portfolio of System on a Chip (SoC) and
Accelerators. The August 27, 2020 press release announcing such collaboration noted that the next generation
software stack would be developed in a dedicated organization within Veoneer and that Veoneer and QTI had signed
a non-binding letter of intent, with definitive agreements anticipated to be finalized thereafter. Following this time
through January 2021, Veoneer and QTI negotiated agreements to implement such collaboration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 22, 2020, Mr. Kotagiri, who was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Magna on October 19, 2020,
contacted Mr. Carlson to update Mr. Carlson on his recent appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of Magna and
to discuss general market dynamics. Subsequently, in the course of Mr. Carlson’s regular communications with
members of the Board, Mr. Carlson informed the Board of the outreach by Mr. Kotagiri.
In January 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had informal discussions during which Mr. Kotagiri indicated that
Magna had been impressed with Veoneer’s strategic accomplishments since discussions between the parties had
terminated in 2019, including Veoneer’s disposition of its brake systems business, the collaboration on ADAS and
the restructuring of existing joint ventures, and that Magna was interested in exploring a strategic transaction with
Veoneer. On February 16, 2021, Mr. Carlson updated the Board at its regularly scheduled meeting of Magna’s
continued interest and engagement.
On January 26, 2021, Veoneer and QTI announced the execution of definitive agreements pursuant to which the
parties would collaborate on the delivery of scalable ADAS/AD solutions (the “Master Collaboration Agreement”).
On March 22, 2021, Magna submitted a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of Veoneer’s
outstanding equity for up to $30 per share in an all-cash transaction (the “March 2021 Proposal”), which
represented a premium of up to 20% to Veoneer’s closing share price on March 22, 2021. Later that same day, Mr.
Kotagiri contacted Mr. Carlson to reiterate Magna’s interest in an acquisition of Veoneer. Mr. Carlson conveyed to
Mr. Kotagiri that he would discuss the March 2021 Proposal with the Board. On March 23, 2021, Mr. Carlson sent an
email to the Board providing an update on Magna’s continued interest in Veoneer and Veoneer’s receipt of the March
2021 Proposal.
On March 25, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on his discussions
with Mr. Kotagiri, and the Board discussed the terms of the March 2021 Proposal, with members of management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley providing their perspectives. After discussion, the Board determined that the
March 2021 Proposal was inadequate to provide a basis for further engagement, as it did not provide a per share
value or value range, only a maximum possible value, and did not provide any of Magna’s assumptions underlying
the maximum possible value offered. The Board instructed management to convey such a response to Magna and
also convey that, subject to the execution of a new non-disclosure agreement, Veoneer would be willing to provide
certain limited, non-public business and financial information to facilitate Magna’s submission of a more substantive
indication of interest. The Board instructed management to engage outside legal counsel, and after receiving
information about Rothschild & Co’s expertise, experience and relationships, authorized management to formally
engage Rothschild & Co as an additional financial advisor for Veoneer due to Rothschild & Co’s industry expertise,
experience and relationships. The scope of Rothschild & Co’s engagement was consistent with Morgan Stanley’s as
the Board determined it would benefit from additional perspectives provided by Rothschild & Co.
As instructed by the Board, Mr. Carlson contacted Mr. Kotagiri and conveyed the Board’s response, indicating that a
letter would follow. Mr. Kotagiri stated that Magna would be willing to provide an updated proposal based on such
additional information from Veoneer. Later that day, Veoneer and Magna entered into a non-disclosure agreement to
facilitate such further discussions, which did not include a standstill.
On March 29, 2021, Mr. Carlson sent a letter to Mr. Kotagiri, informing Magna that the March 2021 Proposal was
inadequate to provide a basis for further engagement, and that while the Board was not pursuing a sale of Veoneer, if
Magna sought further engagement, it would have to provide a clearer and more definitive indication of interest,
including a clear per share price range fully reflecting the strategic value of Veoneer to Magna.
On April 1, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had a telephonic discussion regarding the additional information that
Magna needed in order to provide an updated proposal with a clearer indication of value. On April 7, 2021, Veoneer
provided Magna with select non-public financial information, in response to certain of the items that Magna had
identified as being required to update its proposal.
In April 2021, Veoneer entered into an indemnification agreement with Rothschild & Co, and subsequently, in June
2021 received certain disclosures for the Board regarding Rothschild & Co’s material relationships with Veoneer,
Magna and Qualcomm during the prior two years (the “Rothschild Relationship Disclosure”), and, in July 2021
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
entered into an engagement letter with Rothschild & Co. In July 2021, Veoneer also entered into an addendum to its
existing engagement letter with Morgan Stanley and received certain disclosures for the Board regarding Morgan
Stanley’s material relationships with Veoneer, Magna and Qualcomm during the prior thirty (30) months (the “Morgan
Stanley Relationship Disclosure”).
On April 11, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri submitted an updated, non-binding indication of interest for Magna to acquire all of
Veoneer’s outstanding equity for between $28 and $30 per share in an all-cash transaction (the “April 2021
Proposal”), which represented a premium between 13% and 21% to Veoneer’s closing share price on April 9, 2021.
The April 2021 Proposal set forth certain key assumptions underlying the proposed value and stated that Magna’s
ability to confirm proposed value would depend on validating certain of those assumptions through due diligence on
Veoneer, which Magna was prepared to engage in immediately. Magna also indicated in the April 2021 Proposal that
being able to engage on a bilateral basis would be critical to Magna. The April 2021 Proposal also contained Magna’s
request to enter into an exclusivity agreement.
On April 12, 2021, Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley”), Magna’s outside legal counsel, provided Veoneer and its outside
counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), with a draft exclusivity agreement.
On April 15, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on his
discussions with Mr. Kotagiri and the limited non-public information that had been provided to Magna, in
accordance with the Board’s instructions, and the Board discussed the terms of the April 2021 Proposal, including
the request for Veoneer to enter into an exclusivity agreement. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild &
Co reviewed their preliminary analyses of the proposed transaction. Following the Board’s discussion of the terms of
the April 2021 Proposal, with management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co providing
their perspectives, the Board determined that the indicated value range in the April 2021 Proposal did not fully reflect
the value represented by Veoneer and did not provide an appropriate basis for further engagement. The Board
instructed management to reject Magna’s April 2021 Proposal, including the request for an exclusivity agreement, but
to inform Magna that the Board would be willing to engage further if Magna were to provide a meaningfully higher
indication of value. Furthermore, the Board directed management to provide limited additional non-public information
to Magna, subject to the parties’ existing non-disclosure agreement, and to make select members of management
available to answer follow-up questions relating to the information provided, which the Board believed would
enhance Magna’s ability to put forward a meaningfully higher indication of value. In a letter dated April 19, 2021,
Veoneer conveyed the Board’s determinations to Magna and subsequently worked with Magna to provide additional
due diligence materials during the weeks thereafter.
On May 7, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri submitted an updated, non-binding indication of interest for Magna to acquire all of
Veoneer’s outstanding equity for $30 to $32 per share in an all-cash transaction (the “May 2021 Proposal”), which
represented a premium of between 30% and 38% to Veoneer’s closing share price on May 6. Later that same day, Mr.
Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had a telephonic discussion, in which Mr. Kotagiri emphasized that the value range
indicated in the May 2021 Proposal was the highest possible proposed value range that Magna was willing to offer
prior to engaging in comprehensive diligence and reiterated Magna’s expectation of bilateral negotiations if the
parties were to move forward on the basis of the May 2021 Proposal.
On May 10, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
on the terms of the May 2021 Proposal from Magna and his discussions with Mr. Kotagiri, with members of
management providing their perspectives. At the request of the Board, the representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Rothschild & Co reviewed the financial terms of the May 2021 Proposal from Magna and their preliminary financial
analyses of the proposed transaction, representatives of Skadden reviewed certain legal matters, including directors’
fiduciary duties in the context of evaluating a proposal to acquire Veoneer, and process considerations relevant to
such an evaluation. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co also reviewed with the Board certain
alternative paths available to Veoneer, including determining not to further pursue a potential transaction with Magna
and focusing on Veoneer’s standalone plan, engaging in further due diligence and discussions with Magna on a
bilateral basis, and engaging further with Magna in the context of a broader process involving additional parties,
along with the potential benefits and considerations in connection with each alternative. Members of Veoneer
management noted for the Board parties with whom preliminary discussions regarding various transactions had been
held in the past, and reviewed the nature of more recent contacts received regarding interest in various types of asset
transactions with Veoneer, which included discussions with Magna, a verbally communicated
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
interest from a strategic firm involved in the automotive safety industry (“Party A”) in an acquisition of the Restraint
Control Systems (“RCS”) business without any indication of proposed value, and a verbally communicated interest
from another strategic firm involved in the automotive safety industry (“Party B”) in an acquisition of the Arriver
Business. The Board discussed such alternative paths and the potential benefits and risks associated with each such
path, including the potential negative impact of disposing particular assets on the remainder of Veoneer. The Board
determined, based on such discussions, that management should clarify the intentions of Party A and Party B,
including any initial indication of value.
The Board also discussed Veoneer’s relationship with Qualcomm in its capacity as a commercial partner, its possible
reaction to an acquisition of Veoneer by a third party, and related considerations for further engagement with Magna.
The Board, members of management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden also
discussed Magna’s request for an exclusivity agreement and reviewed the potential impact of an exclusivity grant on
process and Veoneer’s flexibility, the potential impact on negotiating leverage, the possibility of Magna not
proceeding with further engagement absent exclusivity, and other factors.
Following discussion, the Board determined that the May 2021 Proposal from Magna appeared to represent a
potential opportunity for Veoneer Stockholders to realize value that could be superior to the continued execution of
the current standalone business plan, considering market uncertainties and execution risks including challenges as
Veoneer seeks to transition its business to focus on ADAS and Active Safety, which requires significant investment
in order to fund future operations with uncertainty as to the timing and amount of return on investment, and ongoing
semiconductor supply shortages that are creating industry delivery and cost challenges for Veoneer as well as other
industry participants. The Board noted, however, that the May 2021 Proposal from Magna still lacked definitiveness
in key aspects. The Board instructed management to prepare to continue further engagement with Magna in order to
seek further definitiveness in its proposal, and to reject the request for an exclusivity agreement, but not to respond
with this message until members of management had clarified the terms of outreach that had recently been received
from Party A.
On May 13, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson provided an update
on his discussions with members of management of Party A, which indicated it was not willing to provide an
indicative value range or further clarity on any proposed terms, and that management was working to schedule a call
to discuss with Party B’s management its interest. The Board further discussed, with input from the advisors,
Magna’s May 2021 Proposal, Veoneer’s current market prices, Veoneer’s standalone business plan and the risks of
successfully executing the standalone business plan. The Board also discussed the status of Magna’s interest,
Magna’s request for an exclusivity agreement, the ability to continue to keep Magna engaged in developing a
solidified proposal and the potential risks posed by contacting additional parties to solicit possible interest, and
determined that Veoneer should not contact additional parties at that time. Following discussion, the Board instructed
management to proceed with further engagement with Magna, including through the provision of due diligence to
allow Magna to solidify a proposal, but only after entry into a more comprehensive non-disclosure agreement with a
customary standstill, and not to enter at that time into the exclusivity agreement requested by Magna. In light of the
determination to further engage with Magna, the Board also instructed management to notify Qualcomm of Veoneer’s
receipt of a proposal for a potential acquisition in accordance with the terms of the Master Collaboration Agreement.
On May 14, 2021, Veoneer provided QTI with notice pursuant to the Master Collaboration Agreement that Veoneer
had received a proposal from a third-party relating to a potential acquisition of Veoneer.
In addition, on May 14, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had a telephonic discussion, in which Mr. Carlson
conveyed that while the Board did not believe that Magna’s May 2021 Proposal reflected the full value of Veoneer,
the Board was willing to pursue further engagement, including giving Magna access to broader due diligence, to
support Magna in making a more definitive proposal at a higher value. Following such conversation, Mr. Carlson sent
a response letter to Magna’s May 2021 Proposal, reflecting the foregoing conversation. Also, on May 14, 2021, Mr.
Lars Sjöbring, General Counsel of Veoneer, sent to members of Magna management a revised version of the existing
non-disclosure agreement, updated to include a standstill provision, along with a draft clean team agreement with
respect to provision of certain commercially sensitive information. Over the course of the following week,
representatives of Skadden and Sidley negotiated the terms of the non-disclosure agreement and clean team
confidentiality agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 17, 2021, Qualcomm’s President and Chief Executive Officer elect, Cristiano Amon, had a telephonic
discussion with Mr. Carlson to discuss the potential impact of an acquisition of Veoneer on the collaboration
arrangements between Qualcomm and Veoneer.
On May 18, 2021, Mr. Nakul Duggal, the Senior Vice President and General Manager, Automotive, and Mr. Duane
Nelles, the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Qualcomm, had a telephonic discussion with Mr.
Carlson and Mr. Sjöbring to express Qualcomm’s interest in acquiring Veoneer’s Arriver Business, and to express
concern about the impact an acquisition of Veoneer by a third party would have on the collaboration arrangements
between Qualcomm and Veoneer under the Master Collaboration Agreement.
Also, on May 18, 2021, members of the managements of Veoneer and Magna held a telephonic discussion with
respect to the diligence process for the next several weeks, including application of clean team protocols with respect
to commercially sensitive information.
On May 20, 2021, Magna and Veoneer finalized and entered into the amended and restated non-disclosure agreement
(the “Magna NDA”), which included a standstill provision with customary fallaways and the ability to make
confidential proposals to the Company, and the clean team confidentiality agreement.
On May 20, 2021, following up on the telephonic discussions held on May 17 and May 18, 2021, Qualcomm notified
Veoneer that it desired to enter into discussions regarding the acquisition of the Arriver Business. Representatives of
Veoneer and Qualcomm had subsequent communications regarding their commercial relationship during the course of
which Qualcomm reiterated its intention to submit a proposal to acquire Arriver.
Mr. Carlson subsequently provided an update to the Board regarding diligence by Magna, Qualcomm’s indicated
interest, status of communications with Party B with respect to its interest in the Arriver Business and related assets
and the outreach from a company in the automotive technology industry (“Party C”) regarding its interest in
pursuing an undefined transaction involving the Arriver Business. No subsequent proposals were submitted by
Party B or Party C, and discussions with Party A, Party B and Party C did not progress to the point where such
parties executed non-disclosure agreements or received non-public information regarding Veoneer.
Over the course of the following three weeks, members of Veoneer management and Magna management, along with
their advisors, held multiple video conference calls to discuss a variety of diligence topics, including finance,
business, human resources, legal, tax and regulatory matters. Representatives of Veoneer’s and Magna’s advisors
also attended these calls. On June 9, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co, on behalf of
Veoneer, sent a letter to Magna outlining the process for Magna to submit a solidified proposal for its proposed
acquisition of Veoneer, and requesting that such solidified proposal be submitted on or before June 11, 2021.
On June 15, 2021, in response to the process letter of June 9, Mr. Kotagiri submitted an updated, non-binding
indication of interest for Magna to acquire all of Veoneer’s outstanding equity for $31.25 per share in an all-cash
transaction (the “June 2021 Proposal”), which represented a premium of 29% to Veoneer’s closing share price on
June 14. In the June 2021 Proposal, Magna requested certain changes to diligence protocols to enhance Magna’s
access to information and reiterated its request for Veoneer to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Magna. On the
same day, Magna sent a revised draft exclusivity agreement, providing exclusivity for a period of 28 days, subject to
automatic extensions.
On June 16, 2021, the Board held a meeting by video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
with respect to the process with Magna, including receipt of the June 2021 Proposal and Magna’s request for
additional due diligence to permit it to offer enhanced value to Veoneer’s Stockholders, and management’s
interactions with Qualcomm, including Qualcomm’s expressed intention to submit a proposal for an acquisition of the
Arriver Business. Representatives of Skadden discussed legal matters and representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Rothschild & Co provided their preliminary perspectives on the June 2021 Proposal from Magna. Mr. Ray Pekar, the
Chief Financial Officer of Veoneer, reviewed with the Board an overview of management’s business planning
assumptions through 2030 for purposes of management’s standalone valuation of Veoneer. The Board discussed the
terms of Magna’s June 2021 Proposal and the possibility of a proposal from Qualcomm, and discussed issues
associated with any potential sale of the Arriver Business by Veoneer. Following discussion, the Board instructed
management to, among other things, (1) request a detailed due diligence plan from Magna, to help assess the status
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and the level of difficulty involved in further developing the proposed transaction with Magna, and (2) seek a
solidified proposal, including value, from Qualcomm with respect to an acquisition of the Arriver Business to enable
management and the Board to determine whether further engagement with Qualcomm regarding its proposal would be
warranted at that time.
Also on June 16, 2021, in accordance with the Board’s directions, Veoneer’s senior management communicated to
Qualcomm Veoneer’s desire that Qualcomm submit a solidified proposal, including an indication of value.
On June 18, 2021, Qualcomm submitted a non-binding indication of interest for an acquisition by Qualcomm of one
hundred percent (100%) of the Arriver Business, and any associated assets, on a cash and debt free basis, for an
aggregate purchase price of $2 billion (“Initial Arriver Proposal”). In the Initial Arriver Proposal, Qualcomm
indicated that it would be willing to consider Veoneer retaining a minority equity stake in the Arriver Business for a
period of time, as well as exploring a partnership with other potential acquirors for a combined acquisition offer for
Veoneer. The Initial Arriver Proposal also described Qualcomm’s interest in Veoneer’s Arriver Business due to the
complementary strengths and technical abilities demonstrated under the Master Collaboration Agreement, including
Qualcomm’s belief that its intimate knowledge of the technology and product roadmap of the Arriver Business would
permit Qualcomm to diligence and execute such a transaction expeditiously.
On June 20, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on the status of the due diligence
process with Magna and the terms of the Initial Arriver Proposal received from Qualcomm. Mr. Pekar reviewed with
the Board management’s business plan for 2020-2023 and preliminary long-term planning financial extrapolations
through 2030 based on business planning assumptions previously reviewed with the Board, which the Board
approved for purposes of providing to Veoneer’s financial advisors as the bases for their financial analyses. The
Board discussed considerations with respect to a potential sale of the Arriver Business, including the strategic
importance of the Arriver Business to Veoneer’s future business plan, the potential value represented, and additional
risks and challenges in such a transaction, including, among other things, complexity in separation, tax costs and
ramifications to the remaining business and other reasonably available alternatives to Veoneer. Representatives of
Skadden discussed legal matters. Following discussion, the Board instructed management to (1) continue to engage
with Magna, refine the plan for additional required diligence and reject exclusivity at this stage, and (2) respond to
Qualcomm with the message that the Arriver Business was not for sale on the terms proposed by Qualcomm in the
Initial Arriver Proposal, but that the Board might be willing to engage in a discussion with respect to a transfer of
ownership in tranches over a period of time at a significantly higher valuation.
Over the following weeks, members of Veoneer management engaged with representatives of Qualcomm to discuss
possible terms of a transaction pursuant to which Qualcomm would acquire the Arriver Business in a staged sale
transaction over time, allowing for a more organized disentanglement of the Arriver Business from Veoneer’s other
businesses and providing for continuing ownership by Veoneer of an interest in the entities of the Arriver Business
for several years with upside value potential to Veoneer.
On June 24, 2021, as instructed by the Board, Mr. Carlson sent a letter to Mr. Kotagiri in response to Magna’s June
2021 Proposal, stating that, after careful consideration, the Board’s view was that Magna’s June 2021 Proposal still
did not reflect the full value of Veoneer, but that the Board was willing to continue providing diligence materials to
Magna with the expectation that it would help Magna to improve its proposal. Veoneer also indicated that Magna’s
request for additional diligence materials was overly generic, and proposed that the management teams work together
to ensure targeted scope and process for remaining diligence. Members of Veoneer management and Magna
management, along with representatives of their respective advisors, worked together over the following days to
refine the scope of remaining due diligence.
On June 27, 2021, Qualcomm submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest to Veoneer, together with a term
sheet for an acquisition of the Arriver Business indicating an increase in its proposed valuation for the Arriver
Business to $2.5 billion if certain milestones were met. Subsequently, on June 28, 2021, Qualcomm provided Veoneer
with a further revised non-binding indication of interest, increasing the potential earnout valuation if certain
milestones were met.
On July 1, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Pekar updated the Board on
the financial performance of Veoneer. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on the terms of Qualcomm’s proposal for an
acquisition of the Arriver Business and the status of discussions with Magna, including management’s continued
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
engagement on diligence in an effort to enable Magna to improve its June 2021 Proposal. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley and Rothschild & Co provided preliminary perspectives on Magna’s June 2021 Proposal and Qualcomm’s
proposal for an acquisition of the Arriver Business. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters with the
Board, including an overview of key provisions that will be in the merger agreement, including customary “no-shop”
covenants. The Board, management and Veoneer’s advisors discussed, among other things, Magna’s request for an
exclusivity agreement, potential outreach to additional third parties soliciting interest in a transaction with Veoneer
and the potential benefits and risks of reaching out to additional parties. Following discussion, the Board determined
that at such time the potential risks of outreach to third parties outweighed the potential benefits, and instructed
management to continue to engage with Magna and to seek to improve its June 2021 Proposal, to continue rejecting
entry into an exclusivity agreement and to engage further with Qualcomm if it reverted with a meaningful increase in
value offered for the Arriver Business.
Over the course of the following three weeks, members of Veoneer management and Magna management continued
to engage in the due diligence process. Representatives of Veoneer’s and Magna’s advisors attended certain of these
meetings.
On July 6, 2021, Qualcomm submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest, dated July 4, 2021, and revised
term sheet, indicating its proposed valuation for the Arriver Business, comprising a baseline valuation of $2.5 billion
through a series of three (3) investments by Qualcomm - an initial $1.0 billion dollar investment followed by a $500
million investment on the first anniversary of the initial investment and a $1.0 billion investment on the second
anniversary of the initial investment, with up to $400 million in potential additional consideration based on the
achievement of certain performance targets relating to the Arriver Business being awarded a prescribed number of
OEM contracts, which it stated as constituting its best and final offer for the Arriver Business.
On July 8, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
on the diligence process with Magna, the revised proposal from Qualcomm for an acquisition of the Arriver Business
and an informal unsolicited contact from a private equity firm regarding potential interest in Veoneer’s Non-Arriver
Business. With respect to the revised proposal for the Arriver Business, management reviewed with the Board the
potential ramifications from a sale of the Arriver Business that might not be accounted for in Qualcomm’s proposal,
including significant tax costs and the obligation to continue funding future operational and capital expenditures of
the Arriver Business until the closing of the final investment tranche. Management also reviewed with the Board the
challenges to the remaining business posed by a sale of the Arriver Business, including the potential for negative
reactions from customers, loss of revenue and potential risks to the ability to capture certain business opportunities
as a result of significantly reduced size. The Board discussed the need to assess the value of Qualcomm’s proposal in
light of the foregoing ramifications and challenges on the remaining business. The Board also discussed whether to
reach out to additional parties at that time, and, determined that the potential downsides of outreach to third parties
would outweigh the potential benefits, and that at such time, it would be advisable to focus on maximizing value in
the transactions proposed by each of Magna and Qualcomm. As such, the Board instructed management to continue
pursuing both potential transactions with Magna and Qualcomm, and to encourage Qualcomm to make a proposal for
the whole company in light of the challenges posed by a sale of the Arriver Business. At the same meeting,
representatives of Skadden also reviewed a summary of the terms of the draft merger agreement prepared for possible
distribution to Magna.
On July 9, 2021, Skadden sent a draft of the Magna Merger Agreement to Sidley.
In the lead up to July 11, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Amon, the Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm, had a telephonic
discussion regarding its revised proposal for the Arriver Business. Mr. Carlson conveyed Veoneer’s position and
followed up with a letter on July 11, 2021, indicating that while Veoneer remained open to any value-maximizing
transaction for its stockholders, the revised proposal from Qualcomm did not fully compensate Veoneer for the value
of the Arriver Business and the associated costs and potential impact of such a sale on Veoneer’s remaining
businesses. During the same discussion, Mr. Carlson encouraged Mr. Amon to find a buyer of the Non-Arriver
Business as part of an acquisition of Veoneer. Veoneer’s response letter also provided that a proposal with a
substantially higher baseline valuation and opportunity for meaningful upside, might be viewed favorably the Board
but would need to address the associated challenges and dis-synergies, or that alternatively, a proposal for the whole
company could address these issues.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 15, 2021, Veoneer management sent a mark-up of the draft term sheet to Qualcomm. Among other things,
Veoneer management requested that Qualcomm consider making a proposal for the whole company and indicated that
any sale of the Arriver Business would need to compensate Veoneer Stockholders for any of the costs and dis-
synergies that might be realized in connection with separating the Arriver Business.
On July 16, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
on discussions with Magna and Qualcomm. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co reviewed their
preliminary financial analyses of the June 2021 Proposal from Magna, including based on preliminary long-term
planning financial extrapolations through 2030 based on business planning assumptions previously reviewed with
the Board, which the Board approved for purposes of providing to Veoneer’s financial advisors as the basis for their
financial analysis, as well as preliminary long term planning financial extrapolations for 2031-2035 based on business
planning assumptions provided by Veoneer’s management and reviewed with the Board. Mr. Pekar reviewed
management’s financial analyses of Qualcomm’s proposal for the Arriver Business, including sensitivity analyses
based on the Arriver Business’s future performance, which would determine any potential upward adjustment in
purchase price under the proposal. Members of management also reviewed in more depth with the Board the
challenges for the remaining Veoneer businesses following a sale of the Arriver Business, including the burden of a
significantly smaller company maintaining dual listing status, costs of restructuring resulting from the Arriver
Business carve-out, dis-synergies and the potential for negative impact on retention of employees. Management
informed the Board that Qualcomm continued to decline to make a proposal with respect to a whole company
transaction. The Board discussed the attractiveness of Magna’s June 2021 Proposal and the preliminary financial
analyses reviewed by Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co, the risks to management’s standalone plan and the
benefits and risks of the potential alternatives available to the Company, including a sale of the Arriver Business to
Qualcomm. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters with the Board. Following discussion, the Board
instructed management to continue engaging with Magna and Qualcomm, with the goal of maximizing value
proposed by both parties.
On July 16, 2021, Skadden received a mark-up of the Magna Merger Agreement from Sidley, which raised several
issues, including the standard for regulatory efforts, a requirement of Magna receiving certain stockholder support
agreements, certain exclusions to the definition of “Material Adverse Effect,” treatment of unvested equity awards
and certain restrictions on the business prior to closing.
On July 19, 2021, representatives of Skadden discussed the mark-up of the Magna Merger Agreement with Sidley,
and identified the key open issues that would need to be resolved. Over the course of the following few days,
representatives of Skadden, Sidley and members of Veoneer and Magna management, negotiated the Magna Merger
Agreement, the stockholder voting agreements related to the Magna Merger Agreement and the disclosure
schedules to the Magna Merger Agreement, and also completed confirmatory due diligence by Magna.
On July 19, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
on negotiations with Magna and Qualcomm noting that Qualcomm declined to deliver a written proposal for the
whole company. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co each reviewed their preliminary financial
analyses of Qualcomm’s proposal to acquire the Arriver Business. Following discussion, the Board instructed
management to prioritize negotiations with Magna, in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in, and substantial
potential negative ramifications arising from, Qualcomm’s proposal to acquire the Arriver Business but to continue to
seek to further develop the terms of its proposal. At the instruction of the Board, representatives from Veoneer and its
advisors continued to make themselves available to Qualcomm in an effort to clarify and develop the terms of
Qualcomm’s proposal; however, at the time, Mr. Amon advised Mr. Carlson that Qualcomm was not prepared to make
an offer for the entire company and that Qualcomm was not, at that time, willing to improve the terms of its prior
proposal to acquire the Arriver Business.
On July 20, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
on negotiations with Magna and Qualcomm, including Qualcomm’s indication to Mr. Carlson that it was unwilling to
make a proposal to acquire Veoneer in its entirety. Mr. Sjöbring and representatives of Skadden updated the Board on
the open issues being negotiated in the Magna Merger Agreement, including the standard for regulatory efforts,
delivery of stockholder support agreements related to the Magna Merger Agreement, certain exclusions to the
definition of “Material Adverse Effect,” treatment of unvested equity awards and certain restrictions on the business

prior to closing, covenants relating to non-solicitation of competing transactions and recommendation of the
transaction by the Board and exceptions to such covenants, the definition of a superior transaction and whether a
proposal for the Arriver Business should be included therein, the size of the termination fee payable by Veoneer in
certain circumstances, including to enter into a superior proposal, and certain termination events giving rise to
payment of the termination fee. Following discussion, the Board instructed management to continue prioritizing
negotiations with Magna and to continue moving toward finalizing the Magna Merger Agreement.
On July 21, members of Veoneer and Magna management, and representatives of Skadden and Sidley, continued to
negotiate the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and stockholder support agreements with certain Veoneer
Stockholders who had entered into non-disclosure agreements with Veoneer.
On July 21, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board
on negotiations with Magna, and Mr. Sjöbring provided an update on due diligence, negotiation of the Magna
Merger Agreement and communications planning. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co
reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of the June 2021 Proposal from Magna. Following discussion, the Board
instructed management to continue finalizing negotiations with Magna, with the goal of entering into a definitive
agreement with Magna prior to Veoneer’s second quarter earnings release.
On July 22, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to consider the proposed
Magna Merger Agreement. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters and the proposed terms of the Magna
Merger Agreement, and noted for the Board the resolution of previously open points that had been reviewed with
the Board, including the regulatory efforts obligations, certain termination rights, the size of the termination fee and
the definition of superior proposal. The directors discussed the terms of the proposed transaction, Veoneer’s
prospects, the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and other matters. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Rothschild & Co reviewed their respective financial analyses of the proposed transaction with Magna, and each
rendered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its respective written opinion to the
Board, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations
and assumptions set forth in such written opinion, the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of
Veoneer Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the Magna Merger Agreement was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. After discussing the proposed transaction and considering the
presentations by Skadden, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co, the Board unanimously (i) approved the Magna
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement, including the merger, (ii)
determined that the Magna Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Magna
Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Veoneer and its stockholders and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of Veoneer vote in favor of the approval of the merger, the Magna Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of the Magna Merger Agreement.
Following the meeting of the Board, the parties executed the Magna Merger Agreement on July 22, 2021, and shortly
thereafter, Veoneer and Magna issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Magna Merger
Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of the Magna Merger Agreement, Magna entered into voting and
support agreements with certain stockholders (the “Voting Agreement Stockholders”), each of which agreed,
subject to certain conditions, to vote its shares of Veoneer Common Stock for the adoption of the Magna Merger
Agreement. The Voting Agreement Stockholders and their respective affiliates collectively owned 20,738,124 shares
of Veoneer Common Stock as of the date of the voting and support agreements, representing approximately eighteen
and a half percent (18.5%) of the total outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock.
On July 22, prior to the announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement, Mr. Carlson informed Mr. Amon of the
pending announcement.
On August 5, 2021, Qualcomm publicly announced that it had submitted an unsolicited non-binding proposal to the
Board pursuant to which Qualcomm proposed to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the Veoneer Common Stock
for $37.00 per share in cash (as such proposal and documents relating thereto were revised and amended as further
described herein, the “Qualcomm Competing Proposal”), which described, among other things, Qualcomm’s belief
that together Qualcomm and Veoneer would be uniquely positioned to accelerate competition and create a choice for
the automotive ecosystem, as well as Qualcomm’s indication that it was prepared to offer “regulatory-related closing
protection” to Veoneer, following the completion of its focused due diligence review. The Qualcomm Competing
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Proposal also noted that while Qualcomm’s interest in Veoneer is driven by the Arriver Business and Qualcomm plans
to explore a divestment of the Non-Arriver Business to parties who are better positioned to grow the Non-Arriver
Business, neither the separation nor sale of the Non-Arriver Business was a condition of the Qualcomm Competing
Proposal and neither would be required to be completed prior to closing of the proposed acquisition of Veoneer.
On August 6, 2021, the Board held a meeting at which members of Veoneer’s senior management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.
Following discussion, the Board determined to meet again on August 8, 2021, and instructed management and
Veoneer’s advisors to continue evaluating the Qualcomm Competing Proposal in advance of the Board’s next
meeting.
On August 8, 2021, the Board held a meeting at which members of Veoneer’s senior management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing Proposal. After
reviewing the Qualcomm Competing Proposal and Veoneer’s obligations under the Magna Merger Agreement,
consultation with Veoneer’s financial and legal advisors, and discussion, the Board determined, in accordance with
the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal constituted a “Competing
Proposal” (as defined in the Merger Agreement), that such Competing Proposal would reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Magna Merger Agreement) and that the failure to engage with
Qualcomm would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties to Veoneer’s stockholders. After the meeting, and
at the direction of the Board, Veoneer issued a press release announcing its intention to engage with Qualcomm in
accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and instructed Skadden to deliver a draft confidentiality
agreement to Qualcomm’s counsel, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”). Shortly thereafter,
on August, 8, 2021, Veoneer sent a notice to Magna informing it of the Board’s determination in accordance with the
terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and Veoneer’s intention to engage in negotiations and/or discussion with,
and furnish information to, Qualcomm. On the same day, Veoneer sent a notice to Qualcomm notifying them of the
Board’s determination.
On August 11, 2021, Veoneer and Qualcomm entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the
Magna Merger Agreement) (the “Qualcomm NDA”), the terms of which were substantially identical to the terms of
the existing Magna NDA, including a standstill provision with customary fallaways and the ability for Qualcomm to
make confidential proposals to the Company. Following the execution of the Qualcomm NDA, representatives from
Veoneer, Qualcomm, and their counsels discussed expectations regarding Qualcomm’s due diligence. Thereafter,
Veoneer began to provide Qualcomm and its representatives with due diligence access.
Following execution of the Qualcomm NDA, Veoneer provided Qualcomm and its representatives with due diligence
information as permitted by the Magna Merger Agreement, including access to confidential information regarding
financial, legal, tax and intellectual property matters, and holding discussions with representatives of Qualcomm and
its respective advisors.
On August 19, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden updated the Board on the
pending transaction with Magna including progress on regulatory filings and other pre-closing matters, as well as
updating the Board on the due diligence process being pursued by Qualcomm and the potential risk to Veoneer from
an extended period of uncertainty and devotion of management resources to Qualcomm’s due diligence. The
directors considered ongoing engagement with Qualcomm with respect to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and
instructed management to continue to engage with Qualcomm by continuing to provide due diligence access.
On August 24, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, at which members of Veoneer’s senior
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden updated the Board on the
pending transaction with Magna including progress on regulatory filings and other pre-closing matters, as well as
updating the Board on the due diligence process being pursued by Qualcomm. Representatives of Skadden noted
that Qualcomm had not yet provided terms of a proposed merger agreement in connection with its proposal, and
reviewed for the Board’s consideration potential merger agreement terms for a Qualcomm transaction based on the
Magna Merger Agreement, but reflecting a limited number of changes, including changes intended to provide
substantial closing certainty in a potential transaction with Qualcomm. The directors considered ongoing
engagement with Qualcomm with respect to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and instructed management to
continue to engage with Qualcomm by continuing to provide due diligence access and providing to Qualcomm a
proposed draft merger agreement on the terms discussed, including a regulatory efforts covenant requiring
Qualcomm to take all actions

TABLE OF CONTENTS
necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and a reverse termination fee if such approvals were not obtained, and no
closing condition based on a material adverse effect occurring with respect to Veoneer, in an effort to obtain a
detailed, solidified proposal from Qualcomm as promptly as practicable. On the same day, Mr. Carlson wrote to Mr.
Amon requesting that Qualcomm promptly make a definitive proposal to acquire Veoneer for the Board to consider, if
it was planning to do so.
Also on August 24, 2021, Skadden sent the draft merger agreement to Paul Weiss, and concurrently provided the
draft to Sidley in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.
The following week representatives of Veoneer contacted representatives of Magna to inquire whether Magna would
consider enhancements at that time to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, including with respect to
enhanced regulatory efforts requirements and increased price.
On September 7, 2021, members of Veoneer’s senior management team took part in a diligence call with senior
personnel and other representatives from Qualcomm and SSW to discuss, among other matters, diligence questions
raised by Qualcomm in connection with the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.
On September 8, 2021, Magna, in light of, among other things, uncertainty surrounding the acquisition of Veoneer
and third-party efforts to recruit certain Veoneer engineers, provided Veoneer with its written consent to increase the
size of the employee retention pool from $5 million to $35 million and provided Veoneer with additional flexibility
regarding the vesting terms for any such payments.
On September 9, 2021, Veoneer filed its definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A soliciting stockholder approval for
the Magna Merger Agreement, which stated that should Qualcomm provide a complete proposal for the acquisition
of Veoneer, including a merger agreement, the Board intended to evaluate, in consultation with Veoneer’s financial
and legal advisors, whether it would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Magna
Merger Agreement) and, if so, negotiate with Qualcomm and/or Magna, if appropriate, to seek to obtain the best
available transaction for Veoneer’s stockholders.
During this period, Qualcomm engaged in discussions with various potential buyers of the Non-Arriver Business
who could partner with Qualcomm. Ultimately, Qualcomm entered into advanced discussions with SSW Investors LP
(“SSW Investors”) regarding a potential acquisition of Veoneer by Qualcomm and SSW Investors. Qualcomm and
SSW Investors agreed that Qualcomm would lead and control negotiations with Veoneer with respect to such
potential transaction, in consultation with SSW Investors.
On September 10, 2021, Qualcomm sent Veoneer a proposed merger agreement and an investment and separation
matters agreement (the “Qualcomm September 10 Documents” and such proposal, the “Qualcomm September 10
Proposal”). The Qualcomm September 10 Proposal described a transaction pursuant to which (i) SSW would acquire
Veoneer in a merger for $37.00 per share in cash, (ii) after the closing of the Merger, Qualcomm and SSW would effect
the Non-Arriver Extraction in accordance with the terms of the Qualcomm September 10 Documents, with the Merger
not being conditioned on Qualcomm and SSW being able to concurrently complete the Non-Arriver Extraction at the
closing of the Merger and (iii) following SSW’s acquisition of Veoneer and completion of the Non-Arriver Extraction,
Qualcomm (or its designated affiliate) would acquire Veoneer, which would then hold only the Arriver Business, from
SSW. The Qualcomm September 10 Proposal, consistent with the Qualcomm Competing Proposal submitted on
August 5, 2021, proposed a regulatory efforts commitment that was consistent with the terms of the Magna Merger
Agreement, but did not include any of the enhancements previously requested by Veoneer, including the regulatory
efforts standard, a reverse termination fee and the absence of a closing condition based on a material adverse effect
on Veoneer.
In accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, on September 11, 2021, Veoneer provided notice to
Magna that it had received the Qualcomm September 10 Documents and provided Magna with copies of the
Qualcomm September 10 Documents.
On September 13, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference to discuss the Qualcomm September 10
Proposal, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild &
Co and Skadden were present. Representatives of Skadden reviewed the legal matters and the proposed transaction
structure and terms proposed by Qualcomm in the Qualcomm September 10 Documents. The Board, after considering
the terms of the transaction proposed by Qualcomm, and receiving the advice of Veoneer’s financial and legal
advisors, determined that the Qualcomm September 10 Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal (as defined in the Magna Merger Agreement). On September 14, 2021, Veoneer provided notice
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to Magna, in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, that the Board had reached such a
determination. That day, Skadden sent a revised draft of the Qualcomm merger agreement to Paul Weiss, and
subsequently on that day shared such draft with Magna as required under the terms of the Magna Merger
Agreement.
Throughout this period, Veoneer, Magna and its respective representatives continued to progress regulatory filings
and cooperate in pursuit of the transactions contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement. During the same period,
Veoneer and its representatives continued to facilitate diligence by Qualcomm and its representatives as permitted
under the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.
On September 15, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri, on behalf of Magna, delivered a letter by email to Mr. Carlson and the Board in
which he expressed Magna’s concern that Veoneer’s ongoing consideration of the Qualcomm Competing Proposal
and the Qualcomm September 10 Proposal could result in damage to Veoneer. Magna described certain adjustments it
was willing to make to the regulatory covenants of the Magna Merger Agreement that it believed would increase
certainty of closing by including an enhanced standard of efforts for Magna to obtain regulatory approval. Magna
did not propose an increase to its price per share.
On September 16, 2021, representatives of Veoneer, Qualcomm and their counsel held a call regarding the transaction
structure proposed by the Qualcomm September 10 Proposal and related matters.
On September 20, 2021, Veoneer sent Qualcomm a further revised draft of the merger agreement included with the
Qualcomm September 10 Documents (the “Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement”), which was provided to
Magna in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement. On September 21, 2021, Veoneer and
Qualcomm and their counsel held a call to discuss regulatory matters, including how Qualcomm’s proposed
regulatory approach compared to that of the Magna transaction.
Also on September 21, 2021, Veoneer received a communication from a strategic party expressing interest in buying
Veoneer assets in Asia, but no proposal was subsequently received.
On September 22, 2021, Veoneer management provided an update to the Board including with respect to the
transaction with Magna, the transaction proposal from Qualcomm and ongoing engagement with Qualcomm to
finalize diligence and negotiate improved terms to the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement, and discussions with
Magna regarding enhanced terms to the Magna Merger Agreement. At the meeting, the Board was apprised of the
communication received regarding interest in Veoneer’s Asian business.
Also on September 22, 2021, representatives of Veoneer and Qualcomm and their advisors met telephonically and
discussed proposed changes to the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement. On September 23, 2021, representatives
from Skadden and Sidley held a call to discuss certain potential enhancements to the terms of the Magna Merger
Agreement in response to Qualcomm’s Competing Proposal. That day, Veoneer and Qualcomm’s counsels exchanged
revised drafts of the documents related to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and Veoneer provided Magna with
copies of such documents as required under the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.
On September 24, 2021, the Board met to discuss the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, at which time representatives
from Skadden reviewed the terms of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement, including how it compared to the
terms offered by Magna in the Magna Merger Agreement, as well as regulatory considerations with respect to each
transaction. The Board instructed management to ask Qualcomm and Magna to each put forward its best offer. On
September 25, 2021, Skadden sent Magna’s counsel a draft of an amendment to the Magna Merger Agreement.
Also on September 25, 2021, Skadden sent revised drafts of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement and draft
disclosure schedules to representatives of Paul Weiss and shared the revised documents with Magna’s counsel in
accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.
Throughout the days of September 26 and September 27, 2021, Veoneer and Qualcomm’s counsel exchanged further
markups of the documents related to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.
On September 28, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri sent a letter on behalf of Magna to Mr. Carlson indicating potential proposed
changes to the Magna Merger Agreement, including that Magna would be willing to implement under certain
circumstances an enhanced standard of efforts for Magna to obtain regulatory approvals; the addition of carve-outs
to the definition of “Company Material Adverse Effect” related to adverse deterioration of customer or supplier
relationships or employee attrition; and changing the measurement date for the vesting of certain performance-based
51

stock awards to the date of such proposed amendment (the “Magna Amendment Proposal”). Magna also indicated
that it would be willing to extend financing to Veoneer during the period between the adoption of the Magna Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting and closing, but did not provide the amount or terms of any such financing.
Magna did not propose an increase to its price per share.
Also on September 28, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden updated the Board on the
pending transaction with Magna including progress on regulatory filings and other pre-closing matters, as well as
updating the Board on the latest terms of the Magna Amendment Proposal and the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.
The directors considered ongoing engagement with Qualcomm with respect to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal,
and instructed management to continue to engage with Qualcomm and Magna in accordance with the terms of the
Magna Merger Agreement.
On September 29, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent a revised draft of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger
Agreement to Paul Weiss. Thereafter, Skadden and Paul Weiss exchanged drafts of the documents related to the
Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and Veoneer shared these with Magna in accordance with the terms of the Magna
Merger Agreement.
On September 30, 2021, Mr. Carlson spoke separately with Mr. Amon and Mr. Kotagiri regarding the Qualcomm
Competing Proposal and the Magna Amendment Proposal, respectively, asking that Qualcomm and Magna each
confirm that Veoneer had received their best offers, including with respect to price, so that Mr. Carlson could ensure
that the Board had the best information available as it considered the Qualcomm Competing Proposal and the Magna
Amendment Proposal. During Mr. Carlson’s discussions with Mr. Kotagiri, Mr. Kotagiri indicated that Magna would
likely not be willing to increase its proposed price to a level that would be competitive with the price offered in the
Qualcomm Competing Proposal.
On October 1, 2021, Veoneer and SSW held a call as part of Veoneer’s diligence on SSW.
On October 2, 2021, the Board held a videoconference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing
Proposal, which Paul Weiss had confirmed was being signed by Qualcomm and SSW substantially
contemporaneously with Veoneer’s Board meeting and thus would be binding on Qualcomm and SSW, and the
Magna Amendment Proposal and the uncertainty around whether Magna would be willing to increase its proposed
price to a level that would be competitive. Representatives from Skadden reviewed legal matters, the key terms of the
Magna Merger Agreement, the Magna Amendment Proposal and the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement and
the key terms of the investment and separation matters agreement and ancillary agreements included with the
Qualcomm Competing Proposal and noted for the Board the resolution of previously open points that had been
reviewed by the Board at prior meetings. The directors discussed the terms of each proposed transaction, the
uncertainty around whether Magna would be willing to increase its proposed price to a level that would be
competitive, Veoneer’s prospects and other related matters. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co
reviewed their respective financial analyses of each proposed transaction.
On October 2 and 3, 2021, at the direction of Veoneer and Magna, representatives from Skadden and Sidley discussed
the possibility of Magna waiving its right to negotiate adjustments to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement
during the Notice Period (as defined in the Magna Merger Agreement) and prepared documentation to memorialize
such a waiver to the extent Magna determined to waive its rights in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger
Agreement.
On October 3, 2021, the Board held a videoconference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing
Proposal and the Magna Amendment Proposal. Skadden reviewed with the Board certain legal matters and the terms
of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement, the Magna Merger Agreement and the Magna Amendment Proposal.
The directors discussed the terms of each proposed transaction, Veoneer’s prospects and other related matters.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co reviewed their respective financial analyses of each
proposed transaction. On October 3, 2021, Rothschild & Co and Morgan Stanley each sent Veoneer updated versions
of the Rothschild Relationship Disclosure and the Morgan Stanley Relationship Disclosure, respectively, including
with respect to SSW, which were provided to the Board. Following discussion, the Board requested that Mr. Carlson
again seek to confirm whether Magna would increase its proposed price to be competitive, or, if not, alternatively,
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to confirm that Magna would waive its right to negotiate adjustments to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement
during the Notice Period to permit Veoneer to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement if the Board were to determine
that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal to be a Superior Proposal.
On October 4, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri, had a call to discuss the Board’s consideration of the proposed
transaction with Qualcomm during which Mr. Kotagiri did not propose an increase in the price offered by Magna and
indicated that if the Board determined that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal was a Superior Proposal, Magna
would waive its right to negotiate adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement during the
Notice Period and execute a waiver of those rights pursuant to the waiver agreement previously prepared by Skadden
and Sidley.
On October 4, 2021, the Board held a videoconference, at which members of Veoneer’s senior management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Skadden reviewed legal matters and
proposed terms of the Merger Agreement, the Magna Merger Agreement and the Magna Amendment Proposal.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co reviewed their respective financial analyses of each
proposed transaction, and each rendered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its
respective written opinion to the Board, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject
to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth in such written opinion, the Merger Consideration payable
to the holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The directors discussed the terms of each
of the Qualcomm Competing Proposal and the Magna Amendment Proposal, and compared the terms, structure,
regulatory features and other aspects of the two alternatives, Veoneer’s business and prospects, and other matters.
After discussing the proposed transaction and considering the presentations by Skadden, Morgan Stanley and
Rothschild & Co, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal constituted a
Superior Proposal under the Magna Merger Agreement and that failure to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement
and approve Veoneer’s entry into the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties to
Veoneer’s stockholders under applicable law, (ii) determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the Magna Merger Agreement, it intended to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement and approve Veoneer’s
entry into the Merger Agreement and (iii) instructed Skadden to provide Magna with written notice of the Board’s
determination and termination intentions. At the direction of the Board, Skadden delivered written notice to Magna of
the Board’s intention to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement and approve Veoneer’s entry into the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Magna Merger Agreement. Concurrently
with the delivery of written notice from Skadden to Magna, Magna waived its right to negotiate any adjustments to
the terms and conditions of the Magna Merger Agreement with Veoneer. Thereafter, the Board unanimously (i)
authorized Veoneer to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement, enter into the Merger Agreement and require that
Qualcomm pay the $110,000,000 termination fee to Magna in connection with the termination of the Magna Merger
Agreement, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Veoneer and its stockholders, (iii) approved the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of Veoneer vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
At the direction of the Board, Skadden delivered written notice to Magna terminating the Magna Merger Agreement,
and Qualcomm concurrently caused to be paid to Magna the $110,000,000 termination fee in satisfaction of Veoneer’s
obligations under the Magna Merger Agreement. Immediately following the termination of the Magna Merger
Agreement, Veoneer, Qualcomm and SSW executed the Merger Agreement on October 4, 2021, and shortly thereafter,
Veoneer, Qualcomm and SSW issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Board to Adopt the Merger Agreement, Thereby Approving the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement
On October 4, 2021, the Board, after considering various factors, including those described in this section below, and
after consultation with Veoneer’s independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) approved the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) determined that
the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable
53TABLE OF CONTENTS
and in the best interests of Veoneer and Veoneer Stockholders and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders
of Veoneer vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby and the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
thereby approving the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) “FOR”
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may be payable by Veoneer to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger and contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Reasons for the Merger
In recommending that Veoneer Stockholders vote in favor of the Merger proposal, the Board, considered a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):
•
Attractive Value. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration represents an attractive value for the
shares of Veoneer Common Stock, based on, among other things, the Board’s familiarity with Veoneer’s
financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and prospects, as well as
Veoneer’s business plan and long-term potential; and, after its review, the Board believed that $37.00 per
share in cash pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement represented the best value reasonably
available for holders of Common Stock, while providing an opportunity, in certain circumstances, to
consider an unsolicited superior proposal made after the announcement of the Merger Agreement.
•
Premium to Market Prices. The Board considered that the Merger Consideration of $37.00 per share in
cash to be received by the holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock in the Merger represents a
significant premium over the market price at which shares of Veoneer Common Stock traded prior to
announcement of Magna Merger Agreement, including that the Merger Consideration of $37.00 per share
represents a premium of:
•
approximately 85.6% over the closing stock price on July 22, 2021, the last trading day prior to the
announcement of Magna Merger Agreement;
•
approximately 73.2% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Veoneer Common
Stock during the one-month period ended July 22, 2021, the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement; and
•
approximately 18% over the $31.25 per share price contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement.
•
Valuation Multiples. The Board considered that the Merger Consideration of $37.00 per share in cash, to
be received by the holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock in the Merger, represents a valuation of
Veoneer at a multiple of:
•
approximately 2.23 times Veoneer’s projected sales for the 2021 fiscal year; and
•
approximately 1.87 times Veoneer’s projected sales for the 2022 fiscal year.
•
Form of Consideration. The Board considered that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides
stockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Veoneer Common Stock, eliminating
exposure to long term business and execution risks.
•
Financial Analyses and Opinions of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co. The Board considered the
financial analyses of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co and the opinions of Morgan Stanley and
Rothschild & Co, both dated October 4, 2021, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based
upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Morgan
Stanley’s opinion and Rothschild & Co’s opinion, the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
shares of Veoneer Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as described in the section entitled
“The Merger -Opinions of Veoneer’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 58 of this Proxy Statement.
•
Risks and Uncertainties in Business. The Board considered Veoneer’s historic results of operations,
strategic plan and the Company Projections (which are defined and described in the section entitled “The
Merger-Projections Provided by Veoneer’s Management” beginning on page 73 of this Proxy Statement),
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and the perceived challenges and risks associated with the Company’s ability to execute on its business
plan, including risks and uncertainties described as “risk factors” in the Company’s disclosure filed with
the SEC. The Board considered that while Veoneer’s business continues to present opportunities for
growth, it faces challenges as it seeks to transition its business, requires significant investment in order to
fund future operations with uncertainty as to the timing and amount of return on investment, and is faced
with the ongoing semiconductor supply shortages that are creating industry delivery and cost challenges
for Veoneer as well as other industry participants. In evaluating the Merger, the Board concluded that even
though the Board believed in the viability of the standalone plan for Veoneer, the value and certainty
presented by the Merger was a more attractive alternative given the execution risks, especially in light of
Veoneer’s status as a smaller company with negative cashflows and particular sensitivity to semiconductor
chip shortages, work stoppages, delays and customer volume reductions.
•
Best Available Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. The Board determined, based on its review,
and after consultation with senior management and its financial advisors, that entering into the Merger
Agreement was more favorable to Veoneer Stockholders than pursuing other potential alternatives,
including the transactions contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement. Further, the Board considered
that between the announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement on July 22, 2021, the initial
announcement of the Qualcomm Competing Proposal on August 5, 2021 and the execution of the Merger
Agreement on October 4, 2021, no other proposals had emerged from other parties. The Board also
considered that it was able to negotiate with both Magna and Qualcomm to improve their respective
proposals before determining to proceed with Qualcomm.
•
Review Process. The Board considered Veoneer’s business, strategy and business plan, prospects and
alternatives over an extended period, during which the Board met, including, as needed, with Veoneer’s
independent legal and financial advisors, twenty two (22) times between March 22, 2021, the date on which
Magna submitted the March 2021 Proposal, and October 4, 2021, the date the Merger Agreement was
approved by the Board.
•
Likelihood of Completion. The Board considered the conditions to closing of the transaction and factors
including (i) regulatory requirements and the regulatory efforts provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii)
stockholder approval requirements.
•
Arriver/Non-Arriver Separation. The Board considered that (i) the Arriver/Non-Arriver Separation
Planning and Cooperation provisions of the Merger Agreement require Veoneer to use its reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Acquiring Parties and their respective representatives, subject to certain
limitations, so that the Non-Arriver Extraction and the Arriver Sale can be implemented as promptly as
practicable after the closing of the Merger and (ii) the Non-Arriver Extraction is not a condition to the
closing of the Merger.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered that the Board and Veoneer’s senior management, in
coordination with Veoneer’s independent legal and financial advisors, negotiated on an arm’s-length basis
with Qualcomm with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The Board
considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the respective representations, warranties,
covenants and termination rights of the parties and the Termination Fee payable by Veoneer as finally
negotiated are reasonable and customary.
•
Opportunity to Receive Competing Proposals and to Terminate the Transaction in Order to Accept a
Superior Proposal. The Board considered Veoneer’s right, in circumstances specified in the Merger
Agreement before the time Veoneer Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, to respond to and negotiate
unsolicited Competing Proposals that are or would reasonably be expected to result in superior proposals
made and to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal (as defined under “The
Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitations of Other Offers” beginning on page 97 of this Proxy
Statement) subject to payment to the Acquiring Parties of the Termination Fee of $110,000,000, which
amount the Board believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and taking into account the range of
such Termination Fees in similar transactions and that the size of the fee should not be a meaningful
deterrent to alternative Competing Proposals.
•
Change of Recommendation. The Board considered that it has the right to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change to Veoneer Stockholders in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) or if Veoneer receives an unsolicited Competing Proposal that the Board determines in
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with Veoneer’s directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law, subject to Veoneer’s payment of a $110,000,000 Termination Fee. The Board
considered that while Veoneer is required to negotiate in good faith with the Acquiring Parties (to the
extent the Acquiring Parties desire to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, Competing Proposals are not precluded under the Merger Agreement.
•
Level of Required Regulatory Efforts. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement requires that the
parties use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary or advisable approvals from
governmental authorities necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as expeditiously as practicable (and in any event at least five (5)
business days prior to the Outside Date, subject to certain limitations, including that the Acquiring Parties
are not required to divest assets having a fair market value exceeding a certain amount or take other actions
that would materially diminish or materially interfere with the benefits that Qualcomm reasonably expects to
receive from its ownership of the Arriver Business).
•
Reverse Termination Fee. The Board considered the Reverse Termination Fee of $225,000,000 that could
become payable to Veoneer under specified circumstances, if at the time of such termination (i) all
conditions other than regulatory conditions have been satisfied or waived (provided no breach by Veoneer
of its regulatory efforts covenant principally caused the failure of the regulatory conditions to be satisfied)
or (ii) any governmental authority of certain competent jurisdictions has issued a final non-appealable law,
order or other action prohibiting the Merger relating to antitrust or investment screening laws (provided no
breach by Veoneer of its regulatory efforts covenant principally caused the imposition of such law, order or
other action).
•
Interim Financing. The Board considered that Qualcomm will provide for a loan facility from Qualcomm (or
a third party and guaranteed by Qualcomm) providing financing in order to satisfy the cash flow and
liquidity needs of the Arriver Business and assets related to the Arriver Business in a manner consistent
with Veoneer’s ordinary course of business consistent with Veoneer’s past practice to the extent requested
by Veoneer for the quarter commencing April 1, 2022, and each of the two subsequent quarters of
$120,000,000 per quarter (up to $360,000,000 in the aggregate) which amounts may in certain circumstances
be forgiven with an additional $120,000,000 (in 2023) to be provided if either party extends the final Outside
Date to April 4, 2023.
•
Stockholder Approval. The Board considered that the consummation of the Merger is subject to the
approval of Veoneer Stockholders, who will have the opportunity to adopt or reject the Merger Agreement.
•
Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights with respect to the Merger for
Veoneer Stockholders who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these
stockholders the ability to seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the “fair value” of their
shares at the completion of the Merger, as described in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning
on page 118 of this Proxy Statement.
The Board also considered, in addition to the above factors, various uncertainties, risks and other potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of
relative importance):
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that Veoneer
Stockholders would lose the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful
execution of Veoneer’s current strategy as an independent public company.
•
Impact of Announcement on Veoneer. The Board considered that the announcement and pendency of the
Merger, or the failure to consummate the Merger, may disrupt Veoneer’s business operations or divert
employees’ attention away from Veoneer’s day-to-day operations, result in significant costs to Veoneer or
harm Veoneer’s relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and others.
•
Tax Treatment. The Board considered that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of Common
Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Possibility of More Attractive Alternative Proposals. The Board considered that because Veoneer did not
engage in active outreach to multiple parties in a broad solicitation of interest, despite the fact that over
seventy-five (75) days had passed since the Company announced its merger agreement with Magna and
over sixty (60) days had passed since Qualcomm announced its competing proposal, it is possible that
other parties could be interested in a potential transaction with Veoneer on more attractive terms than the
Merger (although the Board concluded that the Merger Agreement adequately allows for consideration of
Superior Proposals, under appropriate circumstances).
•
Closing Certainty. The Board considered that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or, if permissible, waived.
•
Possibility of Failure to Receive Stockholder Approval. The Board considered that while it expects the
Merger Agreement to be approved by Veoneer Stockholders, there can be no assurance that Veoneer
Stockholders will approve the Merger Agreement.
•
Regulatory Uncertainty; Prolonged Regulatory Scrutiny. The Board considered that the completion of the
Merger would require antitrust clearance in the United States and potentially other jurisdictions, and
approvals under the investment screening laws of certain countries, and that notwithstanding the parties’
obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals as set forth in the Merger Agreement,
governmental entities may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such
approvals, including the risk of potential delays in granting or failure to grant, by such governmental
entities, regulatory approvals for the Merger and considered these risks in comparison to the risks under
the transactions contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement. Further, the Board considered that the
contemplated transaction may be under regulatory scrutiny for a lengthy time while seeking such
approvals, during which time Veoneer’s conduct of business would be constrained by the pre-closing
covenants in the Merger Agreement.
•
Possibility of Material Adverse Effect. The Board considered the possibility of the occurrence Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on Veoneer, the non-occurrence of which is a
condition to the Acquiring Parties’ obligation to consummate the Merger.
•
Pre-Closing Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions on Veoneer’s conduct of business prior to
completion of the Merger contained in the Merger Agreement, which could delay or prevent Veoneer from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise, or taking other actions with respect to its operations
during the pendency of the Merger without the Acquiring Parties’ consent.
•
No Solicitation. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on Veoneer’s ability to
solicit competing bids to acquire Veoneer during the pendency of the Merger.
•
Adverse Recommendation Change. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the
Board’s ability to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, and that, subject to certain conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, in the event of Veoneer’s receipt of a Superior Proposal, Veoneer is required
to negotiate in good faith with the Acquiring Parties (to the extent the Acquiring Parties desire to
negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which the Board
must take into account, in good faith, in determining whether to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change.
•
Termination Fee. The Board considered the Termination Fee of $110,000,000 that could become payable to
the Acquiring Parties under specified circumstances, including upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal,
which may discourage third parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or
acquisition of, Veoneer from making unsolicited proposals (although the Board concluded that the
Termination Fee is reasonable in amount, consistent with or below fees in comparable transactions and will
not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in acquiring Veoneer). The Board also considered
the requirement that Veoneer may be required to, under certain circumstances, reimburse Qualcomm for the
$110,000,000 that Qualcomm paid to Magna in connection with the termination of the Magna Merger
Agreement.
•
Litigation. The Board considered the risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be
instituted against Veoneer or its directors and officers, and potential effects of outcomes related thereto.
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Expenses. The Board considered the risk that, if the Merger is not consummated, Veoneer will, with certain
exceptions, be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement and the Merger, as
well as, under certain circumstances, an amount equal to the Acquiring Parties’ expenses (provided that
such amount shall not exceed $15 million).
•
Director and Officer Interests. The Board considered that Veoneer’s directors and officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Veoneer Stockholders generally, as
described in the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer
in the Merger” beginning on page 76 of this Proxy Statement.
•
Risk Factors; Forward-Looking Statements. The Board considered risks of the nature identified in the
section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 30 of
this Proxy Statement.
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the risks,
uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed by the
positive factors associated with the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the
material factors considered by the Board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their
evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching their determinations and
recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the
process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its
ultimate determinations. The Board based its recommendations on the totality of the information presented, including
thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Veoneer’s senior management and the Board’s independent legal and
financial advisors. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 30 of this Proxy Statement.

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan
Stanley by Veoneer, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the Company Projections, Morgan

and judgments of Veoneer’s management of the future financial performance of Veoneer. Morgan Stanley expressed
no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley

with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of
the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Veoneer’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such
persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by Veoneer Stockholders in the transaction. Morgan
Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Veoneer, nor was Morgan
Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on
financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan
Stanley as of, October 4, 2021. Events occurring after October 4, 2021, may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the
assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm
its opinion.
Summary of Morgan Stanley’s Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its
opinion dated October 4, 2021, to the Board. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan
Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with
its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of

summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in
the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and the
factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and
relied upon primarily on the Company Projections. The Company Projections are more fully described below in the
section entitled “The Merger- Projections Provided by Veoneer’s Management” on page 73 of this Proxy Statement.
In accordance with direction from the Board, Morgan Stanley utilized the Company Projections in its financial
analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a
company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared
certain financial estimates for Veoneer with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research
estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share
similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things,
similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar
operating characteristics (the “Comparable Companies”). These companies were the following:
•
Diversified Auto Suppliers with Electronics Exposure: Aptiv, Continental, Denso Corporation, HELLA
GmbH & Co., Magna International, Valeo;
•
Automotive Focused Technology / Electronics Players: Garmin, Gentex Corporation, Softing, TomTom,
Visteon Corporation;
•
Applied Technology Software Leaders: Autodesk, Cadence Design Systems, Dassault Systèmes, Hexagon,
PTC, Synopsys; and
•
Chip / Semiconductor Players: Allegro MicroSystems, Ambarella, Cree, Infineon Technologies, Intel
Corporation, Melexis, NVIDIA, Renesas Electronics, Sensata Technologies, Silicon Laboratories,
STMicroelectronics.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to sales and adjusted EBITDA,
which, for purposes of this analysis, (i) for Veoneer, was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan
Stanley’s use, by Veoneer’s management for calendar years 2021 and 2022 with respect to sales and 2024 with respect
to adjusted EBITDA as part of the Company Projections; and (ii) for each of the Comparable Companies, was based
on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For purposes of its
analyses, Morgan Stanley defined (i) “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus debt including
financial leases, plus tax-effected pension liabilities, plus preferred equity, plus investments in associates, less
unconsolidated assets and cash and cash equivalents, as applicable, and (ii) “adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA
adjusted by Morgan Stanley based on its professional judgment and experience. Based on its analysis of the relevant
metrics for each of the Comparable Companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to sales and adjusted EBITDA multiples and
applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for Veoneer. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan
Stanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as of October 1, 2021 (the last full trading day prior
to the meeting of the Board to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the multiples it derived for the Comparable Companies and based on its professional judgment and
experience, Morgan Stanley applied a range of aggregate value to sales and aggregate value to adjusted EBITDA
multiple to Veoneer’s estimated sales for 2021 and 2022 and estimated adjusted EBITDA for 2024 discounted to year
end 2021 and 2022. Based on the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, and
Veoneer’s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt including financial leases, plus tax-effected pension liability,
less cash and cash equivalents and investments in associates) as provided by Veoneer’s management and the
selected ranges of aggregate value to sales and adjusted EBITDA, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied
value per share of Veoneer Common Stock as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Veoneer. In evaluating the Comparable
Companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Veoneer’s
control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Veoneer’s business and the industry
generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects
of Veoneer and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the
average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a DCF analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by
calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley
calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for the Veoneer Common Stock based on a DCF analysis to
value Veoneer as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized the Company Projections for purposes of its DCF
analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP EBIT, plus
depreciation and amortization expense, less (1) cash taxes, (2) capital expenditures, and plus or minus changes in net
working capital and other adjustments. The Company Projections included estimates provided by Veoneer’s
management through 2023 and estimates based on certain extrapolations prepared based on assumptions provided
by Veoneer’s management (which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by Veoneer’s management)
from 2024 through 2035. The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a mid-year convention, to
present values as of June 30, 2021, at a discount rate ranging from ten point four percent (10.4%) to eleven point nine
percent (11.9%), which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment
and experience, to reflect an estimate of Veoneer’s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of
the capital asset pricing model. For purposes of estimating Veoneer’s weighted average cost of capital, Veoneer’s
convertible note was treated as equity and a beta based on trading history up until July 22, 2021 (the last full
unaffected trading day prior to the announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement) was used.
In its analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetuity growth rates of one and a half percent (1.5%) to two and a half
percent (2.5%). Such perpetuity growth rates were selected upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional
judgment and experience. Morgan Stanley performed the DCF analysis over two periods, a 10-year period and a 15-
year period. The 15-year DCF was developed to capture the potential upside from Arriver beyond the 10-year
projections. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted for total debt including financial leases, plus tax-
effected pension liability, less cash and cash equivalent and investments in associates. Based on the outstanding
shares of

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a
company based on publicly available financial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for
selected automotive technology transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable transactions because they
shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably because they were similar automotive technology
transactions. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the estimated aggregate value of the transaction to the
LTM sales based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of each such transaction. For
purposes of the precedent transactions multiple analysis, Veoneer’s convertible note was treated as debt, assumed to
be repaid and discharged in full in cash following the closing.

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Veoneer or the Merger. In
evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond Veoneer’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Veoneer’s
business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of Veoneer and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the
public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared.
The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of Veoneer derived from the valuation of
precedent transactions were less than or greater than the per share Merger Consideration is not necessarily
dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the Merger, but is one of many
factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis
with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Board, including the following information
described under the sections of this Proxy Statement entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Veoneer’s Financial
Advisors-Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-Historical Trading Ranges” and “The Merger-Opinions of Veoneer’s
Financial Advisors-Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”
Historical Trading Ranges
Morgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical share prices of Veoneer Common Stock.
Morgan Stanley reviewed a range of closing prices of the Veoneer Common Stock for various periods ending on July
22, 2021 (the last full unaffected trading day prior to the announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement). Morgan
Stanley observed the following:
•
Last 30D VWAP: $22.17
•
Last 60D VWAP: $22.71
•
Last 90D VWAP: $23.39
Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for Veoneer Common Stock prepared and
published by equity research analysts prior to July 22, 2021 (the last full unaffected trading day prior to the
announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement). These targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the future public
market trading price of Veoneer Common Stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for the Veoneer
Common Stock was $17 to $38 per share as of various dates ranging from April 28, 2021 to July 15, 2021.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current
market trading prices for Veoneer Common Stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the
future financial performance of Veoneer and future financial market conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to
any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and
opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other
analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As
a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of Veoneer. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Veoneer’s control. These include, among other things, the
impact of competition on Veoneer’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Veoneer and the industry, and in the financial
markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future
results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated October 4, 2021, to the
Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of Veoneer Common
Stock might actually trade.
The Merger Consideration to be received by Veoneer Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was
determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Veoneer and Qualcomm and SSW and was approved by the
Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Board during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend
any specific consideration to Veoneer or the Board, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative
merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to other business or financial
strategies that might be available to Veoneer, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Veoneer to enter
into the Merger Agreement or proceed with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or recommendation as to how the Veoneer
Stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Board to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or of whether the Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance
with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Morgan Stanley’s securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading
and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as
providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and
officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance
positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its
customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Qualcomm, SSW, Veoneer, or any other company, or any currency
or commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan
Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with Veoneer in connection with this
transaction, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by SSW or
its affiliates.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided Veoneer financial advisory services and an
opinion, described in this section and attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C-1, in connection with the Merger,
and Veoneer has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $28.2 million for its services, $1.5 million of
which was payable upon Morgan Stanley rendering its opinion on July 22, 2021 in connection with Veoneer entering
into the Magna Merger Agreement and which has been paid to Morgan Stanley and the remainder of which is
contingent upon the closing of the Merger. Veoneer has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses,
including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
addition, Veoneer has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates
against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the two (2) years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley has provided financial advisory
and financing services for Veoneer and received aggregate fees of approximately $5 to $15 million in connection with
such services. In addition, Morgan Stanley received a fee of $1.5 million in connection with it rendering its opinion on
July 22, 2021 in connection with Veoneer entering into the Magna Merger Agreement. In the two (2) years prior to the
date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley has provided financing services for Qualcomm and received
aggregate fees of less than $1 million in connection with such services. In the two (2) years prior to the date of
Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley has not received any fees from Magna or its affiliates for financial
advisory or financing services. In the two (2) years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley
has not received any fees from SSW or its affiliates for financial advisory or financing services. Morgan Stanley may
also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Qualcomm, SSW, Magna and Veoneer and their
respective affiliates in the future, including providing additional services assisting Veoneer in connection with
Veoneer’s obligations to cooperate in the Arriver Separation and the potential sale of the Non-Arriver Business, and
would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Rothschild & Co US Inc.
Veoneer retained Rothschild & Co as its financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of the potential sale,
merger or other business/strategic combination involving Veoneer, including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Veoneer selected Rothschild & Co based on its qualifications, expertise and
familiarity with Veoneer’s business and industry. As part of its investment banking business, Rothschild & Co
regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
restructurings and other transactions.
On October 4, 2021, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the proposed transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Rothschild & Co delivered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery
of a written opinion dated October 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and on the basis of and subject to the
qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth in the written opinion, the Merger Consideration payable to
Veoneer Stockholders (other than Excluded Shares) in the transaction pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Rothschild & Co’s written opinion, dated October 4, 2021, which describes the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex C-2 to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary
of Rothschild & Co’s opinion contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such
opinion.
Rothschild & Co’s Fairness Opinion
Rothschild & Co’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board in connection with and for the purpose of its
evaluation of the Merger. Rothschild & Co’s opinion should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on
Rothschild & Co’s part to any party. Rothschild & Co’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Veoneer Stockholders (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration payable to such holders in
the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and Rothschild & Co was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion
as to the terms, other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly set forth in its opinion, of the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated thereby, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated thereby. Rothschild & Co expressed no opinion as to the
price at which shares of Veoneer Common Stock would trade at any future time. In addition, Rothschild & Co did not
express any opinion as to Veoneer’s underlying business decision to engage in the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated thereby or the relative merits of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated thereby as
compared to any alternative transaction, including any alternative transaction that the Board considered and elected
not to pursue. Rothschild & Co was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with
respect to the Merger. Rothschild & Co’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to whether to
approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby or a recommendation as to how any holder of
shares of Veoneer Common Stock should vote or otherwise act with respect to the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
thereby or any other matter. In addition, Rothschild & Co was not asked by the Board to address, nor did Rothschild
& Co’s opinion address, (i) the fairness to, or any other consideration of, the holders of any class of securities (other
than holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock and then only to the extent expressly set forth in Rothschild & Co’s
opinion) or creditors or other constituencies of Veoneer or (ii) the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of SSW, Qualcomm, Veoneer, or any
class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.
In connection with its opinion, Rothschild & Co, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated October 1, 2021;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information that Rothschild & Co deemed to be
generally relevant concerning Veoneer and the industry in which it operates, including certain publicly
available research analyst reports and the reported price and historical trading activity for the shares of
Veoneer Common Stock;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies Rothschild & Co deemed generally relevant and the consideration
received in such transactions;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of Veoneer with publicly available information
concerning certain other public companies Rothschild & Co deemed generally relevant, including data
relating to public market trading levels and implied trading multiples;
•
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and
prospects of Veoneer, including the Company Projections; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as Rothschild
& Co deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, Rothschild & Co held discussions with certain members of the management of Veoneer regarding the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, the past and current business operations and financial
condition and prospects of Veoneer, the Company Projections and certain other matters Rothschild & Co believed
necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In arriving at its opinion, with Veoneer’s consent, Rothschild & Co relied upon and assumed, without independent
verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished or made
available to Rothschild & Co by or on behalf of Veoneer and its associates, affiliates and advisors, or otherwise
reviewed by or for it, and Rothschild & Co did not assume any responsibility or liability therefor. Rothschild & Co did
not conduct any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities of Veoneer (including, without limitation, real
property owned by Veoneer or to which Veoneer holds a leasehold interest), nor were any such valuations or
appraisals provided to Rothschild & Co, and Rothschild & Co did not express any opinion as to the value of such
assets or liabilities. Rothschild & Co did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Veoneer, SSW or Qualcomm under
any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In addition, Rothschild & Co did
not assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or the facilities of Veoneer, SSW or
Qualcomm. At the direction of the management of Veoneer, Rothschild & Co used and relied upon the Company
Projections for purposes of its opinion. In relying on the Company Projections, Rothschild & Co assumed, at the
direction of Veoneer, that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments by Veoneer’s management as to the expected future results of operations and financial
condition of Veoneer. Rothschild & Co did not express any view as to the reasonableness of the Company
Projections and the assumptions on which they are based.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Rothschild & Co assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement would be consummated as contemplated in the Merger Agreement without any waiver or amendment of
any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the parties would comply with all material terms of the
Merger Agreement and that in connection with the receipt of all necessary governmental, regulatory or other

business or prospects of Veoneer since the date of the most recent financial statements and other information,
financial or otherwise, relating to Veoneer made available to Rothschild & Co, and that there was no information or
any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Rothschild & Co incomplete or misleading. Rothschild
& Co did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that may result from the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated thereby, nor did its opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters.
Rothschild & Co relied as to all legal, tax and regulatory matters relevant to rendering its opinion upon the
assessments made by Veoneer and its other advisors with respect to such issues. In arriving at its opinion,
Rothschild & Co did not take into account any litigation, regulatory or other proceeding that was pending or may be
brought against Veoneer or any of its affiliates. In addition, Rothschild & Co relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, that the final form of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from
the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by it. Rothschild & Co’s opinion was necessarily based on securities
markets, economic, monetary, financial and other general business and financial conditions as they existed and could
be evaluated on, and the information made available to Rothschild & Co as of, the date of the opinion and the
conditions and prospects, financial and otherwise, of Veoneer as they were reflected in the information provided to
Rothschild & Co and as they were represented to Rothschild & Co in discussions with the management of Veoneer.
Although subsequent developments may affect Rothschild & Co’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it,
Rothschild & Co does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Rothschild & Co’s Financial Analyses
The following represents a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co, each of which
is a standard valuation methodology customarily undertaken in transactions of this type, in connection with
providing its opinion, dated October 4, 2021, to the Board. The summary of these analyses is not a comprehensive
description of all analyses and factors considered by Rothschild & Co. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytical process that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. No one method of analysis should be regarded as critical
to the overall conclusion reached by Rothschild & Co. Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and
weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. The
conclusion reached by Rothschild & Co was based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on
application of Rothschild & Co’s experience and judgment, which conclusion may involve significant elements of
subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Some of the summaries of financial analyses performed by Rothschild
& Co include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed
by Rothschild & Co, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by
Rothschild & Co. The order of analyses described below does not represent the relative importance or weight given
to the analysis by Rothschild & Co.
As used in this section, (a) all references to “fully diluted” shares and phrases of similar import, when used in relation
to Veoneer, mean the number of fully diluted outstanding common shares (including all restricted stock units,
performance stock units, and stock options, calculated on a treasury stock method basis, and conversion shares
issuable upon conversion of Veoneer’s outstanding convertible notes) based on the most recently available
information as of September 30, 2021, as provided by the management of Veoneer to Rothschild & Co and (b) the
“E
V” of a company as of any given time refers to the enterprise value of such company at such time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Public Company Analysis
Rothschild & Co performed a selected public companies analysis in order to derive an implied per share equity value
reference range for Veoneer from the market value and trading multiples of other publicly traded companies and then
compared this implied per share equity value reference range with the Merger Consideration provided for in the
Merger Agreement. Rothschild & Co selected the publicly traded companies that Rothschild & Co deemed most
relevant to consider in relation to Veoneer, based on its professional judgment and experience, because they are
public companies that operate as automotive technology suppliers or diversified automotive suppliers with exposure
to electronics/electrical (“E/E”) systems that for purposes of this analysis Rothschild & Co considered similar to the
operations of one or more of the business lines of Veoneer. However, because of inherent differences in businesses,
operations and prospects, none of the publicly traded companies listed below are directly comparable to Veoneer. The
publicly traded companies selected by Rothschild & Co for purposes of this analysis included the following
companies, which Rothschild & Co refers to, collectively, as the selected public companies:
Automotive Technology Suppliers:
•
Aptiv PLC
•
Garmin Ltd.
•
Sensata Technologies Holding PLC
•
Gentex Corporation
•
TomTom NV
•
Softing AG
Diversified Automotive Suppliers with E/E Exposure:
•
Denso Corporation
•
Continental AG
•
Magna International Inc.
•
Valeo
•
Hella KGaA Hueck & Co.
•
Visteon Corporation
For purposes of its analysis of the selected public companies, Rothschild & Co (i) reviewed, among other things, for
each of the selected public companies, the per share stock price of such selected public companies as of October 1,
2021, public filings made by such selected public companies for certain historical financial information and data for
such selected public companies that Rothschild & Co obtained from broker research and, where applicable, adjusted
to account for certain events such as acquisitions and divestitures, and (ii) calculated the EV of each of the selected
public companies as a multiple of the estimated sales for calendarized years ending December 31, 2021, and December
31, 2022, which multiple Rothschild & Co refers to as “EV/Sales.”
EV was calculated as fully diluted market value based on per share stock prices plus, with respect to each of the
selected public companies, such company’s most recently disclosed net debt and other adjustments or with respect
to Veoneer, net debt as of June 30, 2021, as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of
Veoneer.

Based on the 2021E EV/Sales and 2022E EV/Sales multiples calculated above and on Rothschild & Co’s professional
judgment, Rothschild & Co applied an illustrative range of EV/Sales of 1.10x to 1.50x and 1.00x to 1.35x to the
estimated sales of Veoneer for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, each as provided in the Company Projections,
to reach a range of implied EVs for Veoneer for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. To calculate implied equity values,
Rothschild & Co then subtracted from such implied EVs the amount of net debt of Veoneer as of June 30, 2021, as
provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Veoneer. Rothschild & Co then divided
such implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares of Veoneer Common Stock, as provided and
approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Veoneer, to reach the following reference ranges of
implied value per share of Veoneer Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the Merger
Consideration:

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Rothschild & Co performed a selected precedent transactions analysis in order to derive an implied per share equity
value reference range for Veoneer from enterprise value multiples in merger or acquisition transactions involving
other companies that occurred since 2015 and then compared this implied per share equity value reference range with
the Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement. Using publicly available information, Rothschild &
Co analyzed the enterprise value multiples in the fourteen (14) selected transactions listed in the table below
involving target companies that are automotive technology suppliers or diversified automotive suppliers with
exposure to E/E systems that generally reflected similar characteristics to Veoneer’s business operations.

Based on its professional judgment and experience, Rothschild & Co deemed these transactions relevant to consider
in relation to Veoneer and the Merger Agreement. No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is
identical or directly comparable to Veoneer or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is
not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other
values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which Veoneer or the Merger was compared.
For purposes of this analysis, Rothschild & Co calculated the EV/Sales of the target company during the 12-month
period (“LTM”) ending closest to the date of announcement of the transaction for which such information was
publicly available. For companies where LTM financial information was not available, multiples were calculated using
the annual sales of the target company.
Based on the EV/LTM Sales multiple calculated for the selected transactions and on Rothschild & Co’s professional
judgment, Rothschild & Co applied an illustrative range of EV/LTM Sales of 1.30x to 2.00x to the estimated sales of
Veoneer for fiscal year 2021, as provided in the Company Projections, to reach a range of implied EVs for Veoneer. To
calculate implied equity values, Rothschild & Co then subtracted from such implied EVs the amount of net debt of
Veoneer as of June 30, 2021, as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Veoneer.
Rothschild & Co then divided such implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares of Veoneer Common
Stock, as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Veoneer, to reach the following
reference range of implied value per share of Veoneer Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to
the Merger Consideration:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Rothschild & Co performed a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis for Veoneer in order to derive an implied per
share equity value reference range for the entire Company if it were to remain an independent public company, and
then compared this implied per share equity value reference range with the Merger Consideration provided for in the
Merger Agreement. In this analysis, Rothschild & Co calculated a range of implied EVs by adding (i) the estimated
unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Veoneer was forecasted to generate for the ten- (10) year period from the end
of fiscal year 2021 through the end of fiscal year 2030 and for the fifteen- (15) year period through the end of fiscal
year 2035 based on the Company Projections provided by the management of Veoneer, respectively, after the
application of a range of illustrative discount rates, which were based on the estimated weighted average cost of
capital (“WACC”) for Veoneer to (ii) the terminal value of Veoneer, after the application of a range of illustrative
discount rates based on the estimated WACC for Veoneer. Rothschild & Co estimated the terminal value of Veoneer
by applying an illustrative range of growth rates in perpetuity of one and a half percent (1.5%) to two and a half
percent (2.5%), which Rothschild & Co selected using its experience and professional judgment, to the estimated
unlevered after-tax free cash flows for the terminal period.
Unlevered, after-tax free cash flows for the terminal period were calculated as net operating profit after taxes after
application of the illustrative range of growth rates described above, less increases in net working capital, plus
depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures. Rothschild & Co used the mid-year discounting convention
and applied a range of illustrative discount rates of ten and a half percent (10.5%) to twelve and a half percent
(12.5%), based on an estimated WACC of eleven and a half percent (11.5%), which Rothschild & Co calculated using
the traditional capital asset pricing model.
Rothschild & Co calculated a range of implied equity values for Veoneer by subtracting from the range of implied EVs
the amount of Veoneer’s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the
management of Veoneer. Rothschild & Co then divided the ranges of implied equity values for Veoneer by the number
of fully diluted outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock, as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use
by the management of Veoneer. These analyses indicated the following reference ranges of implied value per share of
Veoneer Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the Merger Consideration:
Implied Value Reference Range Per Share of Veoneer Common Stock

Other Factors
In rendering its opinion, for illustrative purposes only and not relied upon in reaching its conclusion, Rothschild &
Co also reviewed and considered other factors, including:
•
historic closing prices of shares of Veoneer Common Stock, noting, as a reference point, that the closing
price of shares of Veoneer Common Stock ranged from $14.64 to $40.46 in the fifty two- (52) week period
preceding October 1, 2021, the last trading day prior to public announcement of the transaction;
•
based on information Rothschild & Co obtained from FactSet, selected equity analyst per share target
prices for shares of Veoneer Common Stock as of October 1, 2021, noting that the range of these target
prices was from $23.00 to $60.45 and the median of these target prices was $31.25; and
•
the premiums paid in selected precedent transactions, involving U.S. targets announced over the last five
(5) years with implied enterprise values between $1 billion and $5 billion (excluding oil and gas and real
estate transactions) for cash only, noting that the first (1st) and third (3rd) quartile of premiums paid in
these selected transactions relative to the target company’s closing stock price on the day prior to public
announcement of the transaction, ranged from fourteen point three percent (14.3%) to sixty three point
eight percent (63.8%) and based on the first (1st) and third (3rd) quartile premiums noted above and
Rothschild & Co’s professional judgment, Rothschild & Co applied an illustrative range of premiums of
fifteen percent (15%) to sixty five percent (65%) to the closing price per share of Veoneer Common Stock on
July 22, 2021, the resulting range of implied prices was $23.00 to $33.00 per share of Veoneer Common Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The valuation and financial analyses set out above are not a comprehensive description of all analyses and
examinations actually conducted by Rothschild & Co in connection with its opinion and are qualified in their entirety
by reference to the full text of the written opinion of Rothschild & Co attached herein as Annex C-2.
Miscellaneous
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant valuation and financial analyses and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances involved, and therefore a fairness opinion necessarily is not susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Rothschild & Co believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered, without considering
all of the described analyses and factors, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying Rothschild &
Co’s analyses and opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Rothschild & Co considered the results of all of
its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered. Rather, Rothschild & Co
made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the analyses described above as a comparison is
directly comparable to Veoneer or the Merger.
In performing its analyses, Rothschild & Co made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Veoneer.
Rothschild & Co’s analyses were based in part on the Company Projections and other third party research analyst
estimates, which are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results and which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by Rothschild & Co’s analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as
part of the analysis performed by Rothschild & Co with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration payable to
such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and were provided to the Board in connection with
the delivery of Rothschild & Co’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at
which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at any time in the future.
As described above, Rothschild & Co’s opinion, together with the financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co
in connection with its opinion and reviewed by the Board, were among the many factors that the Board took into
consideration in making the recommendation of the Board described in “The Merger-Recommendation of the Board
and Reasons for the Merger” on page 53 of this Proxy Statement. Rothschild & Co was not requested to, and did not,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Board or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration in the Merger. The amount and type of consideration payable in the
Merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Veoneer and SSW and Qualcomm. Consequently,
Rothschild & Co’s opinion should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or the management of
Veoneer with respect to the Merger Consideration or the Merger, including whether the Board would have been
willing to determine that a different Merger Consideration was fair.
Rothschild & Co is acting as financial advisor to Veoneer with respect to the Merger and will receive an aggregate
fee, calculated as of the date hereof, of approximately $28.2 million from Veoneer for its services, $1.5 million of which
became payable upon delivery of Rothschild & Co’s prior opinion in connection with the Magna Merger Agreement
and $26.7 million of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to
reimburse Rothschild & Co for certain expenses and to indemnify Rothschild & Co against certain liabilities arising
out of its engagement.
During the two-year period ending on October 4, 2021, Rothschild & Co did not provide financial services to SSW,
Qualcomm, Magna or Veoneer other than, in the case of Veoneer, with respect to Rothschild & Co’s engagement in
connection with the Magna Merger Agreement and the Merger. Rothschild & Co and its affiliates are engaged in a
wide range of financial advisory and investment banking activities. In addition, in the ordinary course of their asset
management, merchant banking and other business activities, Rothschild & Co’s affiliates may trade in the securities
of Veoneer, SSW, Qualcomm and any of their respective affiliates, for their own accounts or for the accounts of their
affiliates and customers, and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Rothschild & Co or its
affiliates may in the future provide financial services to Veoneer, SSW, Qualcomm and/or their respective affiliates in
the ordinary course of their businesses from time to time and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.

Rothschild & Co’s opinion was given and speaks only as of its date. Subsequent developments may affect

Veoneer does not publicly disclose long-term projections as to future revenue, earnings or other results due to,
among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates
in the fast changing autotech environment. However, for purposes of assessing a possible strategic transaction, and
not for public disclosure, Veoneer provided the Board, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co certain non-public and
unaudited non-GAAP standalone financial forecasts of the Company consisting of Veoneer’s 2021-2023 business
plan and extrapolations for subsequent 10-year and 5-year periods based on underlying planning assumptions
provided by management (the “Company Projections”). At management’s direction, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild
& Co used the Company Projections to perform financial analyses in connection with rendering their respective
opinions described and summarized in the section titled “The Merger-Opinions of Veoneer’s Financial Advisors.”
The 2021-2023 business plan reflected in the Company Projections was made available to Magna in connection with
its due diligence review and to Qualcomm and SSW in connection with their diligence review.
The Company Projections were prepared on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger or the impact of
negotiating or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating
the Merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that will be taken as a result of the Merger
Agreement being executed or the Merger being consummated.

Certain key assumptions underlying the Company Projections include the following:
•
Veoneer’s Active Safety revenue growth rate to remain in line with the Company’s expected market growth
for its Active Safety products through 2030, tapering to approximately 2% growth in 2035. Production
overhead assumed at approximately 9-10% of sales beyond 2023. RD&E, net, assumed to be relatively

Vehicle Production volume growth through 2035 (1-2%), however reduced by approximately $40-50 million
per year of brake control ECU/PCB sales starting from 2024 and onwards in order to ensure that the revenue
contribution of this one-time program did not influence long-term extrapolations. Production overhead
assumed at approximately 9% of sales beyond 2023. RD&E, net, assumed at approximately 7-8% of sales
beyond 2023. SG&A assumes approximately 1-2% inflation beyond 2023.
•
Gross profit leverage for Active Safety is expected to be in the range 30-40% beyond 2023.
•
Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales remains at approximately 4-5% for Active Safety, and 3-4% for
Restraint Control Systems over the period of the Company Projections.
•
Veoneer utilizes net operating losses from 2021 through 2029.
•
Tax rates assumed at approximately 24%.
Important Information about the Company Projections
The Company Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and the summary thereof is
included in this Proxy Statement only because such information was made available to the Board in connection with
its review of a potential strategic transaction, and to Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co for purposes of preparing
their respective financial analyses and fairness opinions provided to the Board on October 4, 2021 in connection with
its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger, as described in the section entitled “The Merger-
Opinions of Veoneer’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 58 of this Proxy Statement. The non-public and
unaudited non-GAAP standalone financial forecasts of the Company consisting of Veoneer’s 2021-2023 business
plan included in the Company Projections were made available to Magna, Qualcomm and SSW in their respective
74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
capacities as potential counterparties to a strategic transaction, in connection with its due diligence review of a
potential transaction. The summary of the Company Projections is not being included in this Proxy Statement to
influence your decision whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Company Projections
were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial
information, or GAAP (and the Company Projections do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by
GAAP). Neither Ernst & Young AB, Veoneer’s independent registered public accounting firm (“E&Y”), nor any other
audit firm has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the
Company Projections and, accordingly, E&Y has not expressed an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto. The E&Y report included in Veoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2020, which is incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement, relates to Veoneer’s historical financial information
and does not extend to the Company Projections and should not be read to do so. The Company Projections are
subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented
with numerical specificity, the Company Projections are forward-looking, and based on a number of assumptions and
estimates that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Veoneer management as of the date of their
preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, including
general economic conditions, competition and the risks discussed in this Proxy Statement under the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 30 of this Proxy Statement.
The Company Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. There
can be no assurance that the figures contained in the Company Projections will be realized, and actual results may
differ materially from those shown therein. Generally, the further out the period to which Company Projections relate,
the more unreliable the information becomes.
THE INFORMATION IN THE COMPANY PROJECTIONS IS NOT FACTUAL AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON
AS BEING NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS, AND VEONEER STOCKHOLDERS ARE
CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE COMPANY PROJECTIONS. The Company Projections
should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements, risk factors and other information
regarding Veoneer contained in Veoneer’s public filings with the SEC.
This Proxy Statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash
Flow (each as defined above). Veoneer believes that its presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful
supplemental information to investors and management regarding Veoneer’s financial condition and results of
operations. Other firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than Veoneer, which limits comparability
between companies. Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP. The non-GAAP
financial measures used in the Company Projections were relied upon by Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co for
purposes of their respective fairness opinions and by the Board in connection with its consideration of a potential
strategic transaction. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the definition of non-
GAAP financial measures and therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial
measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial
measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Morgan Stanley and Rothschild &
Co for purposes of their respective fairness opinion or by the Board in connection with its consideration of a
potential strategic transaction. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included
in the Company Projections.
None of Veoneer, Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Company Projections,
and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Company Projections to
reflect circumstances existing after the date the Company Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of
future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Company Projections, as applicable,
are shown to be in error. Since the date of the Company Projections, Veoneer has made publicly available its actual
results of operations for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. You should review Veoneer’s
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 23, 2021 and October 26, 2021 for this information. Veoneer
does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Company Projections, even in the
event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Veoneer, Morgan Stanley

results will be achieved.

In considering the recommendation of the Board that holders of Veoneer Common Stock vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement, Veoneer Stockholders should be aware that certain of Veoneer’s non-employee directors and executive
officers for purposes of this Proxy Statement have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to,
those of Veoneer Stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other
matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be
adopted by Veoneer Stockholders.
The Acquiring Parties and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of the Merger Agreement in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of Veoneer or Veoneer’s subsidiaries, or any person serving at the
request of Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the “D&O
Indemnified Parties”), as provided in the respective organizational documents or in any agreement for
indemnification, will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect.
The Merger Agreement further requires the Acquiring Parties to (and cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, the D&O Indemnified Parties with respect to all facts,
events, acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to and including the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to
the fullest extent that Veoneer or its subsidiaries would be permitted by applicable law; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any action against any D&O Indemnified Party the expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees) of any D&O Indemnified Party upon receipt, if required by the DGCL, the Surviving Corporation’s
organizational documents or any applicable indemnification agreement, of a written undertaking by him or her or on
his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that such D&O Indemnified
Party is not permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. Further, the Acquiring Parties shall not (and SSW shall
cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any action to which any D&O Indemnified Parties are parties, unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the D&O Indemnified
Parties covered by the action from all liability arising out of such action.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
the Effective Time will occur on December 30, 2022, the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for
purposes of the disclosure in this section (the “Change in Control Date”);
•
the employment of each executive officer of Veoneer will have been terminated by Veoneer without “cause”
or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant
plans and agreements), in either case on or immediately following the Change in Control Date;
•
a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination will be paid in respect of the period worked; and the
amount of such pro rata bonus will be equal to the executive’s target short-term annual incentive for 2021;
•
the performance metrics applicable to Company PSUs, to the extent that the applicable performance period
would end after October 4, 2021, will have been achieved at the target level of performance; and
•
the potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to
avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Tax Code.
In addition, no assumption has been made regarding the regular equity awards that may be made to executive officers
or non-employee directors during 2022, as such awards are not presently determinable, and awards to executive
officers are subject to the consent of the Acquiring Parties.
76TABLE OF CONTENTS
As the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or
be accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially
differ from the amounts set forth below.
Treatment and Quantification of Veoneer Equity Awards
Treatment of Company Options
Each Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically and without any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested)
and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the Merger
Consideration over (b) the per-share exercise price for such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of
shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of Veoneer
Common Stock of such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Treatment of Company RSUs
Each Company RSU which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required under
applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such
Company RSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in respect of dividend equivalent units credited
thereon (if any)) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Treatment of Company PSUs
Each Company PSU which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required under
applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such Company
PSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in respect of dividend equivalent units credited thereon (if
any)) with performance measured (x) based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level
of performance for any performance periods that have concluded prior to October 4, 2021, and (y) based on the
greater of attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the target level of performance or at the actual level of
performance (as determined by the Board) as measured through the Closing Date, for any open performance periods
after October 4, 2021, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Veoneer equity award that may be granted to employees after October 4, 2021,
will have terms and conditions that are consented to by the Acquiring Parties.
Quantification of Accelerating Veoneer Equity Awards Held by Veoneer Directors and Executive Officers
At the Effective Time, each Company Option, Company RSU and Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the Company or the holder
thereof, vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and converted into the Merger Consideration in the manner described
above.
Veoneer non-employee directors hold unvested Company RSUs. Veoneer executive officers for purposes of this Proxy
Statement hold unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs. Each Company Option held by Veoneer’s executive
officers is fully vested as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
See the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 82 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that would
become payable to each Veoneer named executive officer in respect of his unvested Company RSUs and Company
PSUs. See also the section entitled “Quantification of Non-Equity Interests of Executive Officers Other than the
Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 80 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that would
become payable to each Veoneer executive officer other than the named executive officers in respect of his or her
unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director RSUs. Each non-employee director of the Company currently holds 5,263 unvested Company RSUs. Based
on the assumptions described above under “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the
Merger-Certain Assumptions” beginning on page 76 of this Proxy Statement, the estimated amount that would
become payable in the aggregate to Veoneer’s seven (7) non-employee directors in respect of their unvested
Company RSU awards (inclusive of dividend equivalent units credited thereon) is $1,363,117 in respect of 36,841
shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying such total number of unvested Company RSUs.
The following table shows the estimated value of the Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by
such executive officer which would become payable in connection with the Merger.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on the assumptions set forth in the section entitled
“Golden Parachute Compensation” on page 82 of this Proxy Statement. The assumptions may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, and do not
include any equity award grants that may be made after the date hereof and prior to the assumed effective time of
December 30, 2022 (or any later effective time). The table omits Arthur Blanchford, the Company's former EVP, Sales
and Business Development, who ceased to serve as an executive officer as of May 1, 2021, but remained in his officer
role until he ceased to be employed with the Company on October 15, 2021. The table also omits Per Skytt, the
Company’s former EVP, Technical Competence Centers, who is on his termination notice period with a scheduled
termination date of November 30, 2021, prior to the Change in Control Date.

Change in Control Agreements with Veoneer Named Executive Officers; Employment Agreements with Executive
Officers
Veoneer has entered into agreements with Jan Carlson and Lars Sjöbring that provide for enhanced benefits upon the
occurrence of a change in control of the Company (the “Change in Control Agreements”). For purposes of the
Change in Control Agreements, the Merger will constitute a change in control of the Company. The Change in
Control Agreements generally provide that if the executive is terminated from employment by Veoneer without cause
or the executive terminates his employment with good reason, in either case, within two (2) years following the
Change in Control Date (among certain other qualifying terminations), then the named executive officer will receive:
•
A lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to two and a half (2.5) times (for Mr. Carlson) or one
and a half (1.5) times (for Mr. Sjöbring) the sum of the executive’s (x) base salary as in effect immediately
prior to the termination date, or if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or
circumstance constituting good reason, plus (y) the average of the annual cash bonuses earned for the two
(2) fiscal years prior to the year in which termination occurs, or if higher, the bonus payable for the fiscal
year immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting good reason, plus (z)
taxable value of the car and pension benefits such executive would have been entitled to had he remained
employed for a period of one year following the termination.
•
Payment by the Company of all relevant social costs attributable to the severance payment described
above.
Veoneer has entered into employment agreements with the fifteen (15) individuals who are treated as executive
officers for purposes of this Proxy Statement, including the named executive officers (the “Employment
Agreements”). The Employment Agreements (other than the agreement with Mr. Carlson, which is superseded by his
Change in Control Agreement) that contain entitlements to severance generally provide that if the executive is
terminated from employment by Veoneer other than for cause or the executive terminates his employment with good
reason (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreements) during the term of the Employment Agreement,
then the executive officer will receive a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to one and a half (1.5) times
(or in a certain case, one (1) times) the executive’s base salary. The Company is also in certain cases obligated to pay
all relevant social costs attributable to the lump sum severance payment. Certain executives may also become entitled
to a payment in respect of the non-competition restrictions set forth in the executive’s Employment Agreement, if any,
of up to twelve (12) monthly payments equal to the difference between the executive’s monthly base salary (or in the
case of Mr. Carlson, gross salary) as in effect on the date of termination, and the monthly salary earned in any new
employment, with the maximum payments limited to 60% of the executive officer’s annual base salary (or in the case
of Mr. Carlson, gross salary) as of the date of such termination. Under the Employment Agreements, the executive
officer is entitled to receive six (6) months’ notice of termination by the Company (in the case of Mr. Carlson pursuant
to his Change in Control Agreement, such six months’ notice is provided), other than in the event of a termination by
the Company for cause. Payments under the Change in Control Agreements are in lieu of the salary and benefits
payments during the requisite notice period and severance payments under an individual’s Employment Agreement
are not applicable if the executive officer is entitled to payments under such individual’s Change in Control
Agreement. The Acquiring Parties and the Company have agreed that the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and General Counsel will have good reason to resign under their respective Change in Control
Agreement or Employment Agreement following the closing, subject to their continued employment through closing.
The provision of severance payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer’s
execution of a release of claims. The Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Sjöbring further provides that if he
receives any amount that is subject to the “golden parachute” excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 280G and 4999
of the Tax Code, the amount of the payments to be made pursuant to the Change in Control Agreement will be
79
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of the excise tax, but only if the after-tax amount of the reduced
payments exceeds the after-tax amount that he would receive without any such reduction following imposition of the
excise tax and all income and related taxes.
See the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 82 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that would
become payable to each Veoneer named executive officer under his or her respective Change in Control Agreement or
Employment Agreement upon a termination of employment without cause or for good reason as of the Change in
Control Date. See also the section entitled “Quantification of Non-Equity Interests of Executive Officers Other than
the Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 80 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that
would become payable to each Veoneer executive officer for purposes of this Proxy Statement other than the named
executive officers under the officer’s Employment Agreement.
Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan
Veoneer maintains the Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan (the “Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan”),
pursuant to which participants may elect to defer a stated percentage of their eligible compensation for each plan
year; provided, however, the amount deferred may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of a participant’s eligible
compensation. Earnings (and losses) are credited to participants’ accounts based on participant choices between
various investment options and the rate of return determined by the administrative committee of the plan. Participants
are eligible to receive matching contributions equal to eighty percent (80%) of their deferred amounts; provided that
deferred amounts in excess of seven percent (7%) of the participant’s eligible compensation for the period in question
are not eligible for matching contributions.
Participants are always one hundred percent (100%) vested in their deferred amounts and earnings thereon; however,
matching contributions and earnings thereon in a participant’s account are subject to forfeiture in the extraordinary
circumstance that the participant is determined by the Board to have stolen Company assets, violated Veoneer’s
Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics or disclosed confidential business or technical information of Veoneer to
unauthorized third parties. A change in control of the Company is a distribution event for purposes of the Non-
Qualified Retirement Savings Plan. Accordingly, in connection with the Merger, the administrative committee of the
Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan will distribute the accounts of plan participants, with payments to be made in
a single lump sum payment within sixty (60) days following the Change in Control Date.
Possible Compensation Arrangements with the Acquiring Parties
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of Veoneer’s executive officers have entered into any agreement with the
Acquiring Parties or any of their affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the
equity of, the Acquiring Parties, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of their affiliates. Prior to, or following the
closing of the Merger, however, some or all of Veoneer’s executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with
the Acquiring Parties regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the
Acquiring Parties or one or more of their affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation).
Permitted Retention Plan
Veoneer may adopt a retention plan prior to the consummation of the Merger where the amount payable under such
plan, in the aggregate, does not exceed $35,000,000. Retention payments under this program are permitted to be paid
either (A) with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the recipient’s aggregate retention amount by Veoneer on the first
payroll date following each of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing Date or (B)
with respect to 100% of the recipient’s aggregate retention amount on the first payroll date following the sixtieth
(60th) day following the Closing Date (each, a “Retention Vesting Date”) based on continued employment on the
applicable Retention Vesting Date. Payment of the retention awards may be accelerated in the event that a recipient’s
employment is terminated by Veoneer without cause, subject to the recipient’s execution of an effective general
release of claims in Veoneer’s standard form. As of the date hereof, it is not known whether any named executive
officer or other executive officer of Veoneer will receive a permitted retention award, and no executive officer has yet
been granted a retention award.
Quantification of Non-Equity Interests of Executive Officers Other than the Named Executive Officers
The table below shows the estimated amounts that each Veoneer executive officer (including officers who are no
longer deemed to serve as executive officers of the Company but who have served in such capacity at any time since
the beginning of Veoneer’s last fiscal year), other than the named executive officers, would receive upon a
80
TABLE OF CONTENTS
termination of employment without cause or through resignation for good reason assuming that such events
occurred on the Change in Control Date. All accounts under the Company’s Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan
are fully vested and accordingly, the Merger will not result in accelerated vesting under the plan for any executive
officer that participates in the plan. For purposes of this Proxy Statement, an individual who is no longer deemed to
serve as an executive officer of the Company but who has served in such capacity at any time since the beginning of
Veoneer’s last fiscal year, is listed as a former executive officer in the table below.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on the assumptions set forth in the section entitled
“Golden Parachute Compensation” on page 82 of this Proxy Statement. The assumptions may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, and do not
include any equity award grants that may be made after the date hereof and prior to the assumed effective time of
December 30, 2022 (or any later effective time). The table omits Arthur Blanchford, the Company's former EVP, Sales
and Business Development, who ceased to serve as an executive officer as of May 1, 2021, but remained in his officer

Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the table below sets
forth the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger that will or may become payable to each
named executive officer of Veoneer in connection with the Merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the
payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers
of Veoneer in the Merger” beginning on page 76 of this Proxy Statement, which is incorporated herein.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, including
any equity award grants that may be made after the assumed effective time of December 30, 2022. For purposes of
quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
the Effective Time is the Change in Control Date;
•
the employment of each executive officer of Veoneer will have been terminated by Veoneer without “cause”
or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant
plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Change in Control Date;
•
a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination will be paid in respect of the period worked; and the
amount of such pro rata bonus will be equal to the executive’s target short-term annual incentive for 2021;
•
the performance metrics applicable to Company PSUs, to the extent that the applicable performance period
would end after October 4, 2021, will have been achieved at the target level of performance; and
•
the potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to
avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Tax Code.
In addition, no assumption has been made regarding the regular equity awards that may be made to executive officers
during 2022, as such awards are not presently determinable and are subject to the consent of the Acquiring Parties.
For purposes of this disclosure, Veoneer’s named executive officers are: (i) Jan Carlson, President and Chief Executive
Officer; (ii) Lars Sjöbring, Executive Vice President Legal Affairs, General Counsel; (iii) Matthias Bieler, Executive Vice
President Business Unit Europe; (iv) Mats Backman, Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President
Finance; and (v) Nishant Batra, Former Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer.
Messrs. Backman and Batra are no longer employees of Veoneer-Mr. Batra resigned effective January 15, 2021 and
Mr. Backman resigned effective March 1, 2021, each as previously disclosed in the 2021 Proxy Statement.
Accordingly, both Messrs. Backman and Batra have been omitted from these tables as each left Veoneer in the first
quarter of 2021 and did not hold any outstanding equity awards as of the date of this Proxy Statement.

Cash. Represents severance payable to each named executive officer upon a termination of employment by Veoneer without
cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, in each case, pursuant to the named executive officer’s Change in
Control Severance Agreement or Employment Agreement, as applicable, consisting of a lump sum payment reflecting a
multiplier of (x) in the case of the Change in Control Severance Agreements for Messrs. Carlson and Sjöbring, the sum of base
salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination date, or if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of
an event or circumstance constituting good reason; the
82
TABLE OF CONTENTS
average of the annual cash bonuses earned for the two (2) fiscal years prior to year in which termination occurs, or if higher, the
bonus payable for the fiscal year immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting good reason;
and the taxable value of certain car and pension benefits, or (y) base salary in the case of Matthias Bieler pursuant to his
employment agreement. With respect to each executive these multipliers are as follows: Mr. Jan Carlson (2.5), Mr. Sjöbring (1.5)
and Mr. Bieler (1.5). The cash figure for each of the named executive officers includes a pro rata payment of the executive’s
target annual incentive (and, given the assumed Change in Control Date of December 30, 2022, the figures reflect the payment
of a full year’s bonus). The cash figure for Mr. Bieler also includes an estimated payment in consideration for a 12-month non-
competition covenant as provided by his Employment Agreement and described in more detail below. Each named executive
officer’s severance payments constitute “double-trigger” payments under the assumptions stated above, which means that the
amounts will be triggered by a change in control but conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment. In the case of
Messrs. Carlson and Sjöbring, the severance becomes payable if (A) the qualifying termination of employment occurs within the
two (2) years following the Change in Control Date or (B) in the event that the qualifying termination of employment by the
Company (or the event constituting good reason for termination by Mr. Carlson) occurs prior to a change in control at the
request or direction of the acquiror who has entered into an agreement with Veoneer, the consummation of which would
constitute a change in control, or under circumstances in connection with or in anticipation of a change in control, whether or
not the change in control occurs. The Acquiring Parties and the Company have agreed that Messrs. Carlson and Sjöbring will
have good reason to resign under their respective Change in Control Severance Agreements following the closing, subject to their
continued employment through closing. For further details regarding the severance amounts that will or may become payable to
Veoneer’s executive officers, see the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-
Change in Control Agreements with Veoneer Named Executive Officers; Employment Agreements with Executive Officers”
beginning on page 79 of this Proxy Statement. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

(a)
Pursuant to the terms of the severance formula contained in the named executive officer’s Change in Control Agreement,
the average annual bonus paid in respect of 2020 and expected to be paid in respect of 2021 has been used for the
calculation. At the time of termination, for purposes of the severance formula, the higher of the average bonus for the two
years prior to the year of termination or actual bonus paid for the prior completed year will be determined.
(b)
Includes for Mr. Bieler, pursuant to his Employment Agreement, an estimated cash payment in respect of the executive
officer’s 12-month non-competition covenant, equal to 60% of annual base salary, which is the maximum amount available
to the executive officer under his Employment Agreement. Such payment would be made in up to 12 monthly installments.
The salary differential payment in consideration for the non-competition covenant is contingent on the executive
officer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the covenant.
(2)
Equity. Represents the value of the unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs (in each case, inclusive of dividend equivalent
units credited thereon) held by each named executive officer as of the Change in Control Date. The amounts payable in respect
of the unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs at the Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement are “single-trigger” payments, which means that the amounts will become payable solely as a result of continued
employment through the Effective Time. All Company Options held by the named executive officers are fully vested as of the
date hereof and are not subject to acceleration under the Merger Agreement. Consequently, amounts payable in respect of
Company Options are not “single-trigger” payments and are therefore excluded from the following table. For further details
regarding the treatment of the unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs, see the section entitled “Interests of the Directors
and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Treatment and Quantification of Veoneer Equity Awards” beginning on page 77 of
this Proxy Statement. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

NQDC. All accounts under the Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan are fully vested and accordingly, the Merger will not result
in accelerated vesting under the plan. Accordingly, no value is attributed to the Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan. Of the
named executive officers, only Mr. Sjöbring currently participates in the Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan.

The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the Merger generally applicable to
Veoneer Stockholders whose shares of Veoneer Common Stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant
to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Tax Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Tax Code,
court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all
84TABLE OF CONTENTS
as in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations,
possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Veoneer Common Stock
as “capital assets” within the meaning of the Tax Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). For
purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means either a U.S. Holder (as defined below) or a Non-U.S. Holder (as
defined below) or both, as the context may require.
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to holders in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to stockholders subject to
special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as tax-exempt entities, S corporations, partnerships
(including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and partners therein,
financial institutions, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-
market method of accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, persons who are
subject to the alternative minimum tax, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, persons
who actually or constructively own five percent (5%) of more of Veoneer Common Stock, persons who acquire their
shares of Veoneer Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation,
persons who hold their shares of Veoneer Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale,
synthetic security, integrated investment or other risk-reduction transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollars. This discussion does not address any U.S. federal estate,
gift or other non-income tax consequences or any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences, or the consequences of
the Medicare tax on net investment income. If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Veoneer Common Stock, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Veoneer Common Stock and partners therein should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular circumstances.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
described herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax
consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a
court if so challenged.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO
CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND
ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who or
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Tax Code or (ii) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person as defined
in section 7701(a)(30) of the Tax Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Veoneer Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Veoneer
Common Stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss will be capital gain
or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more
85
TABLE OF CONTENTS
than one (1) year at the time of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain will generally apply to long-term capital
gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Veoneer Common
Stock who or that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment, such as
“controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies.” Non-U.S. Holders should consult their
tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to them in
light of their particular circumstances.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain will generally be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a United States person as defined under the Tax Code,
and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits
tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-three
(183) days or more in the taxable year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which
case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate
under an applicable tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the Non-
U.S. Holder; or
•
Veoneer is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (a “USRPHC”), as defined in Section 897 of
the Tax Code at any time within the five-year period preceding the Merger and certain other conditions are
satisfied. Veoneer believes that, as of the effective time of the Merger, Veoneer will not have been a
USRPHC at any time within the five-year period ending on the date thereof.
Holders of Veoneer Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the
Merger to their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of any state, local, foreign or other
tax laws.

"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act has expired or been terminated. Consummation of the Merger is also conditioned on approvals being obtained or
applicable waiting periods having expired or been terminated pursuant to the investment screening laws of France,
Germany and Italy, and no governmental authority of the United States, the People’s Republic of China, France,
Germany or Italy having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect
and has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger.
We currently expect to obtain all antitrust and other regulatory approvals that are required for the completion of the
Merger in 2022.
Veoneer made the filing required under the HSR Act on October 20, 2021, and will make the filings required under the
investment screening laws of France, Germany and Italy, as applicable, promptly pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59 p.m. on November 19, 2021.
HSR Act
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the
Merger cannot be consummated until Veoneer and the Acquiring Parties each file a notification and report form with
the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.
86TABLE OF CONTENTS
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, the FTC or any other non-U.S. regulatory body could take such
action under the antitrust or competition laws as such regulators may deem necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the
parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual
rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, any state, or the equivalent under the Council Regulation or non-U.S. regulatory bodies
could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action
could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the
parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Investment Screening Laws
Consummation of the Merger is conditioned on approvals being obtained or applicable waiting periods having
expired or been terminated pursuant to the investment screening laws of France, Germany and Italy.
Under France’s foreign investment control regime, set out in the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code
Monétaire et Financier), foreign investors must file a request with, and obtain prior authorization from, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MINEFI) for certain investments in certain strategic or sensitive sectors. During the initial
thirty (30) business day review period, MINEFI may indicate whether a transaction falls within or outside the scope
of the control, requires a further analysis, or is cleared. MINEFI has the option of extending the review by an
additional forty five (45) business days.
Likewise, under Germany’s foreign investment regime, set out in the German Foreign Trade and Payment Act
( A u ß e n w i r t s c h a f t s g e s e t z  -  A W G )  a n d  t h e  G e r m a n  F o r e i g n  T r a d e  a n d  P a y m e n t  O r d i n a n c e
(Außenwirtschaftsverordnung - AWV), filings are mandatory for certain investments in strategic sectors. In other
cases, filing is voluntary, and, if the applicant elects to file, it will apply for the issuance of a certificate of non-
objection. The Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) has two (2) months in which to conduct an initial
review. If it has not opened a formal review within that time period the investment is deemed approved. If it opens a
formal review, the BMWi has four (4) months in which to conclude the review proceedings. This time limit is
suspended while the parties and the BMWi are engaged in negotiating a mitigation agreement. In certain cases, the
BMWi may extend the formal review period by up to an additional four (4) months.
Under Italy’s foreign investment regime, set out in Law Decree No. 21 of 15 March 2012 (Decreto-Legge 15 marzo
2012, n. 21), passed by Italian Law No. 56 of 11 May 2012 (Legge 11 maggio 2012, n. 56) (as subsequently amended
and enacted, together with all connected or subordinated implementing decrees and regulations in force - so-called
Golden Powers Legislation), filings are mandatory for certain investments in strategic sectors. The review period is
forty five (45) days, which can be extended if additional information is needed from the filer or a third party, or in the
context of the EU cooperation mechanism.
It is possible that one or more governmental agencies may, as a result of the review, impose a condition, restriction,
qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also
seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals. We anticipate that
all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained. However, there are no assurances as to the
timeliness of obtaining these clearances, that all regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained or that the
granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals would not involve any additional conditions on the
consummation of the Merger.

Between October 29 and November 10, 2021, three (3) complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and one (1) complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York against Veoneer and its directors: Stein v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08869 (S.D.N.Y.);
Whitfield v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-09177 (S.D.N.Y.); Anderson v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-
09190 (S.D.N.Y.); and Amodwala v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06240 (E.D.N.Y.). The complaints each allege
that the preliminary Proxy Statement issued in connection with the proposed Merger between Veoneer and Qualcomm
omitted material information which rendered the preliminary Proxy Statement incomplete and misleading. Specifically,
the complaints allege that the preliminary Proxy Statement failed to disclose material information regarding Veoneer’s
financial projections, Rothschild’s and Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses, and additional information regarding
prior work Morgan Stanley performed for Veoneer and Qualcomm.
87TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each complaint seeks, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction unless and until additional disclosures
are issued; and, if the Merger closes, damages. The defendants believe the complaints are without merit. It is possible
additional lawsuits may be filed between the date of this Proxy Statement and consummation of the Merger.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay
consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Veoneer, including any costs associated with the
indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
governmental authority in the U.S. or other specified foreign jurisdictions shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect and has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering
illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an
injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent
the Merger from being consummated, or from being consummated within the expected time frame.

No later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, the Acquiring Parties shall, at their sole cost and expense,
designate a reputable bank or trust company (the “Paying Agent”) that is organized and doing business under the
laws of the United States, the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable to Veoneer,
to act as paying agent for the payment of the product of (x) the number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock issued

treasury stock), (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, by SSW or Merger Sub or any of their wholly owned

“Aggregate Merger Consideration”), and shall enter into an agreement (the “Paying Agent Agreement”) relating to
the Paying Agent’s responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Veoneer.
Concurrently with the filing of the Certificate of Merger, SSW shall, and Qualcomm shall cause SSW to, deposit, or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (such Aggregate Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the “Exchange Fund”). In
the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
SSW shall, and Qualcomm shall cause SSW to, promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments in full.
The Acquiring Parties shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Veoneer Common
Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Upon surrender of a certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry evidence for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with, in the case of certificates and book-entry evidence not held through The Depository
Trust Company, a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, or, in the case of book-entry evidence held through The Depository Trust Company, receipt of an “agent’s
message” by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such certificate or book-entry evidence shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Veoneer Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate or book-entry
evidence upon the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent’s receipt of such certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), book-entry evidence or “agent’s message,” and the certificate (or affidavit of loss in

cancelled. The Paying Agent Agreement shall provide that the Paying Agent shall accept such certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry evidence of shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the certificates or book-entry
evidence on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the certificates or book-entry evidence.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the certificates or book-entry
evidence for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon written
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures
in the Merger Agreement shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general creditor thereof for
payment of their claims for Merger Consideration (without any interest thereon) in respect thereof, subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an
affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Parties and Veoneer, of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate,
the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement; provided,
however, that the Paying Agent or the Acquiring Parties may, in their reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.
These procedures will be described in the letter of transmittal that you will receive, which you should read carefully in
its entirety.

Material Adverse Effect);

any matter to the extent the adverse consequences or effects of which have been described in reasonable
detail or are reasonably apparent on their face in the publicly available documents filed with or furnished to
the SEC by Veoneer on or after June 29, 2018 and prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (other than any

extent of such disproportionate impact.
In addition, for purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Acquiring Party Material Adverse Effect” means any change,
event, effect or circumstance which, individually or in the aggregate has prevented or materially delayed or materially

In the Merger Agreement, Veoneer agreed that it:
•
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and each of its and their respective directors, officers and
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be immediately terminated all soliciting activities,
discussions, negotiations and access to nonpublic information of Veoneer with, to or by any third party
relating to any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or request that would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Competing Proposal; and
•
shall promptly (within one (1) business day of the date of the Merger Agreement) instruct each third party
that has previously executed a confidentiality or similar agreement to promptly return to Veoneer or destroy

incorporating non-public information) in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality or similar
agreement and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
such third party.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the termination
provisions of the Merger Agreement, Veoneer agreed that it will not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and each of its
and their respective directors, officers and controlled representatives not to, and shall instruct its other

agreement to the extent necessary to permit the person bound by such provision or agreement to make a
Competing Proposal to the Board);

In addition, until the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Merger Agreement, Veoneer agreed
to:
•
as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within one (1) business day after receipt by
Veoneer or any of its representatives of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or request that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Proposal, Veoneer shall deliver to the Acquiring Parties a
written notice setting forth: (i) the identity of the third party making such Competing Proposal, inquiry or
request (including, if applicable, unredacted copies of any written proposals or offers, and any proposed
term sheets and agreements relating thereto) and (ii) the material terms and conditions of any such
Competing Proposal, inquiry or request;
•
keep the Acquiring Parties reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
developments (including any material amendment or modification) regarding such Competing Proposal,
inquiry or request including by providing unredacted copies of any agreements (draft (to the extent
reflecting any material changes in the material terms) or final) and other material documentation to the
extent reflecting any material terms relating thereto that are exchanged between the third party (or its
representatives) making such Competing Proposal, inquiry or request and Veoneer (or its representatives)
on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within one (1) business day) following such exchange; and
•
that it and its subsidiaries will not enter into any contract or agreement with any person subsequent to the
date of the Merger Agreement that prohibits Veoneer from engaging in discussions with the Acquiring
Parties or providing any information to the Acquiring Parties in accordance with the relevant terms of the
Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, at any time after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event that Veoneer receives an
unsolicited Competing Proposal from any person that did not result from or follow a breach of the non-solicitation
covenants in the Merger Agreement and the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that such Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take the actions described in the
subsequent clauses (i) or (ii) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Veoneer Stockholders, then Veoneer
and the Board and their respective representatives may (i) contact such person to clarify the terms and conditions of
such Competing Proposal and (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information and other
access to, any person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives or potential sources of financing
pursuant to customary confidentiality arrangements if the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
legal and financial advisors) that such Competing proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; provided that (A) prior to furnishing any nonpublic
information concerning Veoneer or its subsidiaries, Veoneer receives from such person, to the extent such person is
not already subject to a confidentiality agreement with Veoneer, an executed confidentiality agreement with such
person that is not less favorable in any material respect to Veoneer than in the confidentiality agreement with the
Acquiring Parties (including with respect to non-solicitation and standstill provisions) and, if commercially sensitive
information is to be provided to such person, and such person is a competitor of Veoneer, a clean team agreement
appropriate to address the competitive sensitivities of such competitor and (B) any such material nonpublic
information so furnished shall be promptly made available to the Acquiring Parties to the extent it was not previously
made available to the Acquiring Parties or their representatives. Information that was made available to the Acquiring
Parties pursuant to the “Clean Team” section of the electronic data room shall not be made available to such person
that is a competitor of Veoneer except pursuant to a clean team agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Acquiring Parties.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement:
•
“Competing Proposal” shall mean any proposal or offer made by any person (other than the Acquiring
Parties, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates) or group of persons as defined in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act (A) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, (x) beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
more than twenty percent (20%) of any class of equity securities of Veoneer (by vote or value) pursuant to
a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction or (y) any one or more assets or businesses of Veoneer and its
subsidiaries that constitute more than twenty percent (20%), of the revenues, earnings or assets of Veoneer

indirectly, to any person (other than the Acquiring Parties, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates
or group of persons as used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), of securities (or options, rights, or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing more
than twenty percent (20%) of the voting power of Veoneer or (C) with respect to any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction
involving Veoneer and its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group of persons would have
beneficial ownership (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of securities
representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the total outstanding equity securities of Veoneer (by vote
or value) after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction.
•
“Superior Proposal” shall mean a bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal (with all references to
“twenty percent (20%)” increased to “fifty percent (50%)”) made by a third party on terms that the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and
considering all legal, regulatory and financing aspects and risks of such Competing Proposal and such
other factors as the Board considers to be appropriate, are more favorable from a financial point of view to
Veoneer Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any
changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement committed to by the Acquiring Parties to Veoneer in writing
in response to such Competing Proposal under the provisions of the Merger Agreement).
•
“Intervening Event” means an event, occurrence, change, effect, condition, development or state of facts or
circumstances that materially affects Veoneer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than related to a
Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal, or any proposal which constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal) occurring after the date of the Merger
Agreement that did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and that was neither known to, nor
reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of directors as of the date
of the Merger Agreement) (where, for the avoidance of doubt, the following shall not be taken into account
in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred (x) the fact in and of itself that Veoneer meets or
exceeds projections, earnings guidance, forecasts or estimates and (y) changes in and of themselves in the
price of Veoneer Common Stock or the trading volume thereof).

"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Adverse Recommendation Changes,"Adverse Recommendation Changes
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation that
Veoneer Stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Company Recommendation”). The Merger Agreement
provides that the Board will not affect an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below) except as described
below.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, neither the Board nor any committee thereof may:
(i)
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Acquiring Parties or Merger Sub, or fail to
make, the Company Recommendation;
(ii)
authorize, adopt, approve or recommend, to Veoneer Stockholders or otherwise, or otherwise declare
advisable, any Competing Proposal;
(iii) fail to publicly recommend against any Competing Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation, in each case, within five (5) business days after the Acquiring Parties so requests in
writing; provided, however, that (1) such five (5) business day period shall be extended for an additional
five (5) business days following any material modification to any Competing Proposal occurring after the
receipt of the Acquiring Parties’ written request and (2) the Acquiring Parties shall be entitled to make such
a written request only once for each Competing Proposal and once for each modification to the financial
terms or other material modification to such Competing Proposal;
(iv) upon the written request of the Acquiring Parties, fail to recommend against any Competing Proposal
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such Competing Proposal, or
make any other recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
99TABLE OF CONTENTS
for the equity securities of Veoneer other than a “stop, look and listen” statement pursuant to the Merger
Agreement; provided, however, that the Acquiring Parties shall be entitled to make such a written request
only once for each Competing Proposal and once for each modification to the financial terms or other
material modification to such Competing Proposal;
(v)
approve or recommend, or allow Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries to execute, approve or enter into, any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or
(vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing,
(any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation
Change”).
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) in response to an Intervening
Event, the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with Veoneer’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law or (ii) (x) Veoneer receives an unsolicited Competing Proposal from any person that did not result from or follow a
breach of the Merger Agreement and has not been withdrawn or otherwise expired, and (y) the Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with Veoneer’s
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however, no Adverse Recommendation Change may be
made and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, Veoneer may not terminate the Merger Agreement, unless and until:
•
after the fourth (4th) business day (the “Notice Period”) following the Acquiring Parties’ receipt of a
written notice from Veoneer advising the Acquiring Parties that the Board intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (a “Notice of Adverse Recommendation”), including specifying the Intervening
Event or Superior Proposal and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the third party making
such a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and a true and complete
copy of the most current version of such Superior Proposal (including any proposed agreement or other
offer documents);
•
during the Notice Period, Veoneer and its representatives negotiate in good faith with the Acquiring Parties
and its representatives (to the extent the Acquiring Parties desire to negotiate) to make adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that either the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would no longer be reasonably expected
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law or such Competing Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and
•
in determining whether to make such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board shall take into account,
in good faith, any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement timely proposed by the Acquiring Parties
in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation.
Any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other material change to the terms of such Competing Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and commence a new Notice Period, and Veoneer shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of the Merger Agreement to the extent all references to four (4) business days shall be revised to two
(2) business days.
The Merger Agreement does not restrict Veoneer from taking or disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a)(2) under the Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with applicable law with regard to
a Competing Proposal.",111,112

During the Continuation Period, Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable, will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective affiliates to, provide each Continuing Employee with (i) at least the same base salary and wage rate
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity or equity-based incentives) that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than such incentive compensation opportunities provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits, as determined by Qualcomm

as applicable, in its reasonable discretion, that are either (A) substantially comparable in the aggregate (other than
defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical or other post-termination welfare benefits (unless required pursuant
to a collective bargaining agreement or applicable law) and retention or change in control payments or awards) to the
employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B) substantially
similar to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation Period, Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable,
will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to provide, severance payments
and benefits to each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during such period that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding
the above, to the extent a Continuing Employee is employed in a jurisdiction where applicable law requires different
treatment of such Continuing Employee’s compensation or benefits entitlements, or such Continuing Employee’s
terms of employment are governed by a collective bargaining, works council or similar agreement, Qualcomm or SSW,
as applicable, will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to, comply with the
requirements of any such laws or agreements.
The Acquiring Parties acknowledge that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a “change in control” (or
similar term) of Veoneer under the terms of certain applicable benefit plans set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.
From and after the Effective Time, Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable, will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective subsidiaries to, assume and honor all obligations under certain Change in Control Agreements
and employment agreements set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect
prior to the Effective Time.
Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable, will, or will cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other
eligibility requirements, in any and all benefit plans or arrangements of Qualcomm or SSW, as applicable, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries providing benefits to a Continuing Employee following
the Effective Time (the “New Plans”) to the extent that (i) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a
company benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(collectively, the “Old Plans”) and (ii) such Continuing Employee has satisfied all waiting time and other eligibility
requirements under the Old Plan being replaced by the New Plan. In addition, for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Qualcomm or SSW, as
applicable, will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
to the extent such conditions were previously satisfied, inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plan and (B)
any expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account to the same extent as under such corresponding Old Plan under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.
For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits under the New Plans,
Continuing Employees will receive service credit with Veoneer and its subsidiaries (and any of their respective
predecessors) to the same extent such service credit was granted under a pre-existing Old Plan (other than any
defined benefit or retiree medical or other post-termination welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement), except
where such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits.
Veoneer has agreed that it will terminate Veoneer’s 401(k) Plan, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and contingent upon the closing of the Merger (unless otherwise requested by the Acquiring Parties). As of the
Closing Date, SSW will designate and provide coverage under a SSW 401(k) Plan for the participants in Veoneer’s
401(k) Plan.

Upon reasonable notice, Veoneer shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) afford to the Acquiring Parties and
their respective representatives reasonable access, at the Acquiring Parties’ sole cost and expense, in a manner not
disruptive in any material respect to the operations of the business of Veoneer and its subsidiaries, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice throughout the period commencing on the date of the Merger
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement to the properties, personnel, contracts, books and records (including tax returns and
workpapers) of Veoneer and its subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to such representatives all information (to the extent not publicly available) concerning the
business, properties and personnel of Veoneer and its subsidiaries (including accounting, tax, financing, operating,
environmental and other data and information) as may reasonably be requested. However, Veoneer and its
subsidiaries will not be required to disclose any information to the Acquiring Parties or Merger Sub if such disclosure
would, in the reasonable judgment of Veoneer, (a) cause significant competitive harm to Veoneer or its subsidiaries if
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not consummated, (b) violate applicable law or the
provisions of any agreement to which Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries is a party as of the date of the Merger
Agreement or (c) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege; provided, in each case, that Veoneer shall
give the Acquiring Parties notice of any information so withheld and the parties to the Merger Agreement shall
cooperate in seeking to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that is not reasonably likely to cause
significant competitive harm, violate applicable law or contract or cause any waiver of privilege; provided, further,
that nothing in the Merger Agreement shall authorize the Acquiring Parties or their representatives to undertake any
environmental testing involving the sampling of soil, groundwater, air or other environmental medium or similar
invasive techniques at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by Veoneer or its subsidiaries. The Acquiring
Parties agree that they will not, and will cause its representatives and affiliates (including Merger Sub) not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to the access to information request for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
In addition, within the period of time specified in the Merger Agreement, Veoneer will identify and make available to
the Acquiring Parties all Specified IP Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date of the Merger Agreement.
Except to the extent prohibited by law (including antitrust laws), representatives of each of the Acquiring Parties and
Veoneer shall meet on a weekly basis (or, if requested by the Acquiring Parties, on a twice weekly basis) to discuss
integration planning and other important matters, including material issues that arise with respect to (A) any actual or
potential reduction, deferral or trend in order intake, termination, non-renewal or modification of customer and/or
supplier agreements or deterioration in customer and/or supplier relationships of Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries,
and (B) any actual or potential employee attrition or cessation of employment (other than with respect to employees
who are individually or in the aggregate not material to the Arriver Business or Non-Arriver Business). In each case,
Veoneer is required to provide reasonable details of such matters to the Acquiring Parties, including the identity of
the customer, supplier or employee (as the case may be) and shall promptly consult and cooperate with the Acquiring
Parties in good faith on such matters and appropriate actions that may be taken in connection therewith, at the
Acquiring Parties’ sole cost and expense, in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the operations of the
business of Veoneer and its subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice

discussions directly with such customers, suppliers or employees in advance of any such actual or potential
reduction, deferral or trend in order intake, termination, non-renewal or modification of the relevant agreement,
deterioration of relationship or cessation of employment, in each case with the prior consent of Veoneer (which

In the Merger Agreement, the Acquiring Parties and Merger Sub agreed that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification, contribution and advancement of expenses for facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing as of the date of the
Merger Agreement in favor of the D&O Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective organizational documents
or in any agreement for indemnification, will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect.
The Merger Agreement further requires the Acquiring Parties to (and SSW to cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, the D&O Indemnified Parties with respect to all facts,
events, acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to and including the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to
the fullest extent that Veoneer or its subsidiaries would be permitted by applicable law; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any action against any D&O Indemnified Party the expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees) of any D&O Indemnified Party upon receipt, if required by the DGCL, the Surviving Corporation’s
organizational documents or any applicable indemnification agreement, of a written undertaking by him or her or on
his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that such D&O Indemnified
Party is not permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. Further, the Acquiring Parties shall not (and the
Acquiring Parties shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any action to which any D&O Indemnified Parties are parties,
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the D&O
Indemnified Parties covered by the action from all liability arising out of such action.
For at least six (6) years after the Effective Time, SSW shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect the coverage provided by the existing directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance, employment practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the Closing Date
and maintained by Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable (the “Existing D&O Insurance Policies”), or
provide substitute policies (with Veoneer’s current insurance carriers or other insurance carriers having an A.M. Best
financial strength rating of least an “A”) for Veoneer and the D&O Indemnified Parties who are currently covered by
such Existing D&O Insurance Policies, in either case, with limits and on terms and conditions no less advantageous
to the D&O Indemnified Parties than the Existing D&O Insurance Policies, covering claims arising from facts, events,
acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby
(provided that the Acquiring Parties or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for such insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium
currently paid by Veoneer or any of its subsidiaries for the Existing D&O Insurance Policies (the “Maximum
Amount”), but in such case shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount) and the
Acquiring Parties shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its other subsidiaries to, take any action
that would intentionally prejudice the rights of, or otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of any such
insurance, whether in respect of claims arising before or after the Effective Time (unless such beneficiary is not
entitled to such recovery as a result of a final, non-appealable judicial determination under such insurance as a result
of such beneficiary’s conduct). In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Effective Time, Veoneer may purchase prepaid,
non-cancellable six (6) year “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, employment practices liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (“Tail Coverage”), effective as of the Effective Time, with limits and on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the D&O Indemnified Parties than the Existing D&O Insurance Policies, covering
claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided that Veoneer shall consult with the Acquiring Parties regarding the
proposed terms and premium for such Tail Coverage and the premium for such Tail Coverage shall not exceed the
Maximum Amount), and SSW shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or its applicable subsidiaries) to maintain such
Tail Coverage in full force and effect, without any modification, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, in
which event the Acquiring Parties shall cease to have any obligations to maintain the Existing D&O Insurance
Policies.

Closing Notice may provide that such waiver is not applicable to certain conditions as applied to the Company’s
obligations under the Merger Agreement, which shall be deemed satisfied other than with respect to the failure of
such condition to be satisfied that is primarily caused by any willful breach of Veoneer’s obligations under the
Merger Agreement (and provide that in such case, such condition precedent will not be irrevocably waived) (a

applicable privilege);

be taken by Veoneer or its subsidiaries pursuant to the foregoing clauses with respect to which Veoneer objects to
taking in good faith; provided that in such case Veoneer shall promptly notify the Acquiring Parties of its reason for
such good faith objection, and the Acquiring Parties shall have the opportunity to modify the requested action (or
request a different action) in order to address the reason for Veoneer’s good faith objection and if Veoneer’s good
faith objection is not satisfactorily addressed (in Veoneer’s good faith judgment), Veoneer shall not be required to
take such action. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, (A) the Acquiring Parties shall
ensure that any requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
Veoneer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives, (B) in no event shall Veoneer, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives be required to cooperate in accordance with the Arriver/Non-
Arriver Separation Planning and Cooperation provisions of the Merger Agreement if such cooperation would
reasonably be expected to unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of Veoneer, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives and (C) the Acquiring Parties shall not make a request that

Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21 thereunder, which were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that Veoneer provide Veoneer Stockholders with the
opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or
may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the
section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 82 of this Proxy Statement.
Veoneer Stockholders are asked to indicate their approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by
Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 82 of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying footnotes. Certain of the
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously
formed part of Veoneer’s overall compensation program for its named executive officers, and previously have been
disclosed to Veoneer Stockholders as part of the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and related sections of
Veoneer’s annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation
Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of independent directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in
line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, Veoneer is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Veoneer, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that
will or may become payable to Veoneer’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and
Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” in Veoneer’s Proxy Statement for the
Special Meeting of stockholders.”
Veoneer Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger, and as an
advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Veoneer, the Board or the Acquiring Parties. Accordingly, regardless
of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, Veoneer’s named executive officers will be
eligible to receive the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger in accordance with the terms
and conditions applicable to those payments.",126,126

shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Veoneer Common Stock
held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the
record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you
hold your shares of Veoneer Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or the other nominee.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of Veoneer Common Stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective date of the
Merger, and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the Merger
Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the “fair value” of the
shares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the Court
of Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from
the effective date of the Merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period; provided that, if at any
time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to
each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on
the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the
shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary
payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash
payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair
value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than
the $37.00 per share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal
of their shares.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its
stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section
262 of the DGCL. This Proxy Statement constitutes Veoneer’s notice to Veoneer Stockholders that appraisal rights are
available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this Proxy
Statement as Annex B. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex B carefully.
Failure to fully comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in
the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as
to all Veoneer Stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Veoneer Common
Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding
shares of Veoneer Common Stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the
value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Veoneer Common Stock for which appraisal
rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Veoneer Common Stock, Veoneer believes that if a Veoneer
Stockholder is
118TABLE OF CONTENTS
considering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A stockholder who
loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as described in the Merger
Agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented such shares of Veoneer Common Stock.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Veoneer Common Stock must fully
comply with Section 262 of the DGCL, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Veoneer a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares
before the Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date
of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of
doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should
not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not
vote its shares.
Filing Written Demand",130,131
"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Filing Written Demand,"Filing Written Demand
Any Veoneer Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Veoneer, before the vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the
stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement either by ballot or by proxy. A Veoneer Stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record
the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record
through the effective date of the Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will,
unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will cause a stockholder to
lose the stockholder’s right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy
containing instructions to vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. However, neither voting against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and
of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. The
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will not constitute a
demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will cause the stockholder to lose his, her or its appraisal rights in
connection with the Merger.
Only a holder of record of shares of Veoneer Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Veoneer Common Stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Veoneer of the identity of the holder and
state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If the
shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be
executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as
in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on
behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that,
in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE

STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:

Box 13089, SE- 103 02
Stockholm, Sweden
Any holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration
by delivering to Veoneer a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within sixty (60) days after the effective
date of the Merger. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the
effective date of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of such court and such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, this sentence shall not affect the right of any
holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered upon
the Merger within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.

If the Merger is consummated, within ten (10) days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation
will notify each holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement as of the
date that the Merger has become effective.

"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Filing a Petition for Appraisal,"Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation or any Veoneer Stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder,
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A beneficial
owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own
name, file a petition for appraisal. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease.
The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders
should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair values of shares of Veoneer Common Stock. Accordingly, any Veoneer Stockholders who desire to have their
shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for
appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a Veoneer
Stockholder to file such a petition for appraisal within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL will nullify the
stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the Merger, any Veoneer Stockholder who has
complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the Merger
proposal and with respect to which Veoneer received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of
such Veoneer Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder
within ten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Veoneer Stockholder and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with
120TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of
Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.
Determination of Fair Value",132,133
"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Determination of Fair Value,"Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will appraise the
“fair value” of the shares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware
stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which
rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,
may be considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on
factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by
the Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to
the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not
in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Veoneer believes that the Merger
Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the
Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a
value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Veoneer nor the Acquiring Parties
anticipate offering more than the $37.00 per share Merger Consideration to any Veoneer Stockholder exercising
appraisal rights. Each of Veoneer and the Acquiring Parties reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding,
that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Veoneer Common Stock is less than the
$37.00 per share Merger Consideration.
Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective
Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent (5%)
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment; provided that if at any time before
the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the
amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares
as determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment,
unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment
prior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the
fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court
121TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may
also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Veoneer Common Stock under Section 262 of the
DGCL fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of
Veoneer Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the Merger Consideration,
less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right
to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the
Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for
appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
From and after the effective date of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to
vote Veoneer Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock,
except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Veoneer Common Stock, if any, payable to Veoneer
Stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal
is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with
the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once
a petition for appraisal is filed with the Court of Chancery however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as
to any Veoneer Stockholder without the approval of the court; provided, however, this sentence shall not affect the
right of any holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered
upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.
Failure to comply fully with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a
stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Veoneer Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights
is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

QUALCOMM shall cause SSW to, deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting

or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency

payments pursuant to Section 3.1(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund

later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as the Acquiring Parties and the Company may reasonably
specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as the Acquiring Parties and the Company may reasonably specify).
(ii) Book-Entry Evidence. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Book-Entry Evidence not held through The Depository
Trust Company (and to deliver to The Depository Trust Company, in the case of holders of Book-Entry

represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as the Acquiring Parties and the Company may reasonably specify,
and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Book-Entry Evidence shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall
be in the form and have such other provisions as the Acquiring Parties and the Company may reasonably
specify). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry
Evidence shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Evidence held
through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive
the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(b).

Evidence for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with, in the case of Certificates and Book-Entry

A-4TABLE OF CONTENTS
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Evidence held
through The Depository Trust Company, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Evidence shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Evidence upon the later to occur of (i)
the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent’s receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), Book-
Entry Evidence or “agent’s message,” and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Evidence so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent Agreement shall provide that the
Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Evidence upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation, upon written demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general
creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration (without any interest thereon) in respect
thereof, subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(e) No Liability. None of the Acquiring Parties, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-
Entry Evidence shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Evidence would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Evidence shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent Agreement shall provide that the Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Acquiring Parties or, after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment (including any losses thereon) shall relieve the
Acquiring Parties or the Paying Agent from making, or causing to be made, the payments required by this
Article III, and following any losses (or any diminishment of the Exchange Fund for any other reason below the
level required to make prompt cash payment in full of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the
terms hereof) SSW shall, and QUALCOMM shall cause SSW to, promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no
such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement and (iii) all such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or the Acquiring Parties, as directed by the Acquiring Parties.
(g) Withholding. The Acquiring Parties, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Law. The Acquiring Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to notify or cause to be notified, at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to making any such deduction or withholding, the Person in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding is expected to be made of such deduction or withholding (except no such notification
shall be required if such Person is receiving such consideration as compensation for services for purposes of
applicable Tax Law), which notice shall be in writing and include the amount of and basis for such deduction or
withholding. The Acquiring Parties or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cooperate with such
Person to reduce or eliminate any such requirement to deduct or withhold to the extent permitted by Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its stockholders in accordance with Section 6.2 in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall actively work with Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken
AB (publ) (“SEB”) (in its capacity as SDR custodian) to ensure that SEB facilitates the SDR holders’ rights to
vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as soon as practicable following the date of mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement (and in any event
shall convene such meeting no later than forty-five (45) days after mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement, or
such later date as the parties may reasonably agree).
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, in its reasonable
discretion, adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting after consultation with the Acquiring Parties, only (i) to

following an adjournment thereof, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting; provided, however, that the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned for more than twenty (20) Business Days in the
aggregate from the originally scheduled date of the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of the Acquiring Parties. The Company shall advise each of the Acquiring Parties upon request prior to
the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (and any reconvening thereof) as to the aggregate tally of
proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval and whether such proxies
have

Section 6.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter less the amount of the fair market value determined with respect

thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity interests or (ii) take or agree to take any
other action (including entering into or agreeing to enter into any material license, joint venture or other

shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Representatives all information (to
the extent not publicly available) concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its

may reasonably be requested, including, but not limited to, such access and information reasonably required by
the Acquiring Parties and their respective Representatives in connection with the Arriver/Non-Arriver
Separation Planning and Non-Arriver Extraction; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to the Acquiring Parties or Merger Sub if such

access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any of the Acquiring Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties. No investigation or access permitted pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. Each of the Acquiring Parties agrees that it will

employee attrition or cessation of employment (other than with respect to employees who are individually or in
the aggregate not material to the Arriver Business or Non-Arriver Business). In each case, the Company shall
provide reasonable details of such matters to the Acquiring Parties, including the identity of the customer,
supplier or employee (as the case may be) and shall promptly consult and cooperate with the Acquiring Parties
in good faith on such matters and appropriate actions that may be taken in connection therewith, at the
Acquiring Parties’ sole cost and expense, in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the operations of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice throughout the period commencing on the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII, and shall otherwise
reasonably cooperate with the Acquiring Parties such that the Acquiring Parties may consult and enter into
discussions directly with such customers, suppliers or employees in advance of any such actual or potential
reduction, deferral or trend in order intake, termination, non-renewal or modification of the relevant agreement,
deterioration of relationship or cessation of employment, in each case with the prior consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(c) Within 60 days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall identify and shall make available to the
Acquiring Parties complete, correct and unredacted copies of all Specified IP Contracts to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement; provided, that, in the event that prior to the
end of such 60-day period, the Company believes in good faith that it will not be able to complete its
identification of the Specified IP Contracts within such 60 day period then the Company may, acting in good
faith, by notice to the Acquiring Parties extend such 60-day period by an additional 30 days.

Proposal to the Company Board (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement)), (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Law, or any restrictive provision of
any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any

becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL) or (v) approve or recommend, or allow
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other

proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement as permitted hereunder) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).
Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.5 by any Representative of the Company shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5 by the Company.
(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt by the
Company or any of its Representatives of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or request that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Proposal, the Company shall deliver to the Acquiring Parties a
written notice setting forth: (i) the identity of the Third Party making such Competing Proposal, inquiry or
request (including, if applicable, unredacted copies of any written proposals or offers, and any proposed term
sheets and agreements relating thereto) and (ii) the material terms and conditions of any such Competing
Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep the Acquiring Parties reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of any material developments (including any material amendment or modification)
regarding such Competing Proposal, inquiry or request including by providing unredacted copies of any
agreements (draft (to the extent reflecting any material changes in the material terms) or final) and other material
documentation to the extent reflecting any material terms relating thereto that are exchanged between the Third
Party (or its Representatives) making such Competing Proposal, inquiry or request and the Company (or its
Representatives) on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day) following such exchange.

Competing Proposal from any Person that did not result from or follow a breach of this Section 6.5 and (y) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected
to result in a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take the actions described in the subsequent clauses (i) or
(ii) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law, then the

to result in a Superior Proposal; provided that (A) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company receives from such Person, to the extent such Person is not already
subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Company as of the date hereof, an executed confidentiality
agreement with such Person that is not less favorable in any material respect to the Company than in the
Confidentiality Agreement (including with respect to non-solicitation of employees and standstill provisions)

Parties’ written request and (2) the Acquiring Parties shall be entitled to make such a written request only once
for each Competing Proposal and once for each modification to the financial terms or other material modification
to such Competing Proposal, (iv) upon the written request of the Acquiring Parties, fail to recommend against
any Competing Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Competing
Proposal, or make any other recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange
offer for the equity securities of the Company other than a “stop, look and listen” statement pursuant to Section

for each Competing Proposal and once for each modification to the financial terms or other material modification
to such Competing Proposal, (v) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute, approve or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (vi) resolve, propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) being referred to as an
“Adverse Recommendation Change”).
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if:
(i) in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or
(ii) (x) the Company receives an unsolicited Competing Proposal from any Person that did not result from
or follow a breach of this Section 6.5 and has not been withdrawn or otherwise expired, and (y) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), unless and until: (i) after the fourth
(4th) Business Day (the “Notice Period”) following the Acquiring Parties’ receipt of a written notice from the
Company advising the Acquiring Parties that the Company Board intends to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change (a “Notice of Adverse Recommendation”), including specifying the Intervening Event or Superior Proposal
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the Third Party making such a Superior Proposal, the terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal and a true and complete copy of the most current version of such Superior
Proposal (including any proposed agreement or other offer documents), (ii) during the Notice Period, the Company
and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with the Acquiring Parties and its Representatives (to the extent the
Acquiring Parties desire to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
either the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would no
longer be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
law or such Competing Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii) in determining whether to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account, in good faith, any
changes to the terms of this Agreement timely proposed by the Acquiring Parties in response to a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation. Any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material change to the terms of such Competing Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Adverse Recommendation and commence a new Notice Period, and the Company shall be

required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.5(f) to the extent all references to four (4) Business
Days shall be revised to two (2) Business Days.

position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to
comply with applicable Law with regard to a Competing Proposal (it being agreed that a “stop, look and listen”
communication by the board of directors to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that solely describes the Company’s
receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed
to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or give rise to a termination right exercisable by the Acquiring
Parties pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)). Nothing in this Section 6.5(g) shall permit the Company to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change not otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 6.5.

August 19, 2021 and take all reasonable action to withdraw such proxy statement, and (ii) cancel the special
meeting of the Company’s stockholders contemplated by the Magna Agreement and provide notice of such
cancellation to the Company’s stockholders, as required by law or reasonably requested by the Acquiring
Parties.
(i) For purposes of this Agreement:
(i) “Competing Proposal” shall mean any proposal or offer made by any Person (other than the Acquiring

series of transactions, (x) beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of

Affiliates or group of Persons as used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), of securities (or options,

(a) The Acquiring Parties and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification, contribution
and advancement of expenses for facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of (or in a comparable role with) the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any person serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of (or in a comparable role
with) another Person (the “D&O Indemnified Parties”), as the case may be, in each case, as provided in the
respective organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any indemnification or similar
agreements in effect as of the date hereof that have been made available to the Acquiring Parties or that are in
substantially the form included in the Company SEC Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC by the
Company on or after the Spin Date and prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms (it being agreed that after the Closing such rights
shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable), and SSW shall and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to perform such obligations thereunder. SSW shall cause the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of
director, officer and employee (or comparable) liability that are no less favorable to the D&O Indemnified Parties
than those set forth in the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ organizational documents as of the Closing Date,
which provisions thereafter shall not, for a period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the D&O
Indemnified Parties, except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Acquiring Parties shall (and SSW shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, the D&O Indemnified Parties with respect
to all facts, events, acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to and including the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries would be permitted by
applicable Law; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any Action against any D&O Indemnified
Party the expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) of any D&O Indemnified Party upon receipt, if
required by the DGCL, the Surviving Corporation’s organizational documents or any applicable indemnification
agreement, of a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed
if it is ultimately determined that such D&O Indemnified Party is not permitted to be indemnified under
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.6(b). or elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Acquiring Parties shall not (and the Acquiring Parties shall cause the Surviving Corporation not
to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any Action to which any D&O Indemnified Parties are parties, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all of the D&O Indemnified Parties covered by the Action from
all liability arising out of such Action.
(c) For at least six (6) years after the Effective Time, SSW shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its other Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect the coverage provided by the existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance, employment practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the Closing Date and maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the “Existing
D&O Insurance Policies”), or provide substitute policies (with the Company’s current insurance carriers or
other insurance carriers having an A.M. Best financial strength rating of least an “A”) for the Company and the
D&O Indemnified Parties who are currently covered by such Existing D&O Insurance Policies, in either case,
with limits and on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the D&O Indemnified Parties than the Existing
D&O Insurance Policies, covering claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby (provided, that the Acquiring Parties or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium currently paid by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for the Existing
A-39TABLE OF CONTENTS
D&O Insurance Policies (the “Maximum Amount”), but in such case shall purchase as much of such coverage
as possible for such amount) and the Acquiring Parties shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation
or its other Subsidiaries to, take any action that would intentionally prejudice the rights of, or otherwise impede
recovery by, the beneficiaries of any such insurance, whether in respect of claims arising before or after the
Effective Time (unless such beneficiary is not entitled to such recovery as a result of a final, non-appealable
judicial determination under such insurance as a result of such beneficiary’s conduct). In lieu of such insurance,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase prepaid, non-cancellable six (6) year “tail” directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance, employment practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (“Tail
Coverage”), effective as of the Effective Time, with limits and on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
the D&O Indemnified Parties than the Existing D&O Insurance Policies, covering claims arising from facts,
events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated
hereby (provided that the Company shall consult with the Acquiring Parties regarding the proposed terms and
premium for such Tail Coverage and the premium for such Tail Coverage shall not exceed the Maximum
Amount), and SSW shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or its applicable Subsidiaries) to maintain such Tail
Coverage in full force and effect, without any modification, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, in
which event each of the Acquiring Parties shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this
Section 6.6(c).
(d) In the event that any of the Acquiring Parties, the Surviving Corporation, any of the Company’s
Subsidiaries or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge or amalgamate into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation, merger or
amalgamation or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, the Acquiring Parties shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of
the Acquiring Parties, the Surviving Corporation, any such Subsidiary or all or substantially all of its or their
properties and assets, as the case may be, assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.
(e) The D&O Indemnified Parties are third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6. The provisions of this Section
6.6 shall survive the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each D&O Indemnified
Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. SSW and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable, documented attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any D&O
Indemnified Party in enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this Section 6.6. The rights of each D&O
Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other applicable rights such
D&O Indemnified Party may have under the respective organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, applicable Law or otherwise.
(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing) is made against any of the D&O Indemnified Parties on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim.

"Veoneer, Inc._20211115_DEFM14A_19656349_4335019.Pdf",Employee Matters,"Employee Matters.
(a) Employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who remain
employees of SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable), the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
following the Effective Time are hereinafter referred to as the “Continuing Employees”. For the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending twelve (12) months from the Effective Time, or such longer time as
required by applicable Law (such period, the “Continuation Period”), SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable)
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, provide for each
Continuing Employee (i) at least the same base salary and wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any equity or equity-based incentives) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
incentive compensation opportunities provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits, as determined by SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable) in its
reasonable discretion, that are either (A) substantially comparable in the aggregate (other than defined benefit
pension plans and retiree medical or other post-termination welfare benefits (unless required pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement or applicable Law) and retention or change in control payments or awards) to
the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B)
substantially similar to the employee benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of SSW or QUALCOMM
(as applicable). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation Period, SSW or
QUALCOMM (as applicable) shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to provide, severance payments and benefits to each Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated during such period that are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits as set forth
in Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.9(a) or as
set forth in the remaining subsections of Section 6.9, to the extent a Continuing Employee is employed in a
jurisdiction where applicable Law requires different treatment of such Continuing Employee’s compensation or
benefits entitlements, or such Continuing Employee’s terms of employment are governed by a collective
bargaining, works council or similar agreement, SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable) shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to comply with the requirements of any such
applicable Laws or collective bargaining, works council or similar agreements.
(b) The Acquiring Parties hereby acknowledges that consummation of the Merger will constitute a “change in
control” (or similar term) of the Company under the terms of the Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.9(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(c) From and after the Effective Time, SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable) shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all obligations under the change in
control agreements and employment agreements listed on Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, where length of
service is relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement of SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable), the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to a Continuing Employee after the
Effective Time (collectively, the “New Plans”), such Continuing Employee shall receive service credit for service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) to the same extent such service credit
was granted under a corresponding benefit plan or arrangement (other than any defined benefit or retiree
medical or other post-termination welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except to the extent any such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable) shall, or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause: (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all
New Plans to the extent that (A) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a benefit plan or
arrangement in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
A-41TABLE OF CONTENTS
(collectively, the “Old Plans”) and (B) each such Continuing Employee is treated as having satisfied all waiting
time and other eligibility requirements under the Old Plan being replaced by the New Plan and (ii) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable) shall, or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonably efforts to cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
conditions were previously satisfied, inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plan and (B) any
expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account to the same extent as under such corresponding Old Plan under such
New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(e) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing,
unless otherwise requested by the Acquiring Parties at least five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to
resolutions of the Company’s Board of Directors that are reasonably satisfactory to the Acquiring Parties, the
Company shall terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, and provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan
shall become fully vested in any unvested portion of their Company 401(k) Plan accounts as of the date such
plan is terminated. As of the Closing Date, SSW shall designate and provide coverage under a tax-qualified
defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is sponsored by SSW or one of its
Subsidiaries (the “SSW 401(k) Plan”) for the participants in the Company 401(k) Plan. In connection with the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, to the extent permitted by the SSW 401(k) Plan, SSW shall cause the
SSW 401(k) Plan to accept from the Company 401(k) Plan the “direct rollover” of the account balance (including
the in-kind rollover of promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) of each employee who participated in
the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated who elects such direct rollover in accordance
with the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan and the Code.
(f) SSW or QUALCOMM (as applicable) shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the terms
of each collective bargaining agreement and works council agreement until such collective bargaining agreement
or works council agreement expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the parties thereto.
(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, shall (i) cause any of the Acquiring Parties or any of their respective Affiliates to be obligated to
continue to employ any Person, including any Continuing Employees, for any period of time following the
Effective Time, (ii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other employee benefit plans of the Company or any of the Acquiring Parties (including the requirement to
adopt or establish any such plans) or as a guarantee of employment for any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or individual
Person, including any present or former employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent of any such individual).
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Section 6.9(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
which (if provided more than five (5) days prior to the Closing) shall be updated through Closing, lists all
“employment losses,” as defined in WARN, occurring during the ninety (90) day period prior to the Closing
Date, stating for each such employment loss the date the loss occurred, the location, and the position(s)
involved.

directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by them as a result of any Action against them arising out of any
action taken by them prior to Closing with respect to the Arriver/Non-Arriver Separation Planning (including
any acts performed by them under this Section 6.10) and any information utilized in connection therewith,
except, in each case, to the extent such costs, expenses, judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties, damages,

of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives.

failure by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to comply with the
provisions of this Section 6.10 after use of reasonable efforts to do so. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, it is understood and agreed that the condition precedent set forth in Section 7.2(b) as applied to
the Company’s obligations under this Section 6.10 shall be deemed satisfied unless the Non-Arriver Extraction is
unable to be completed at the time it otherwise would have been completed following the Closing as a direct
result of the Company’s intentional material breach of its obligations under this Section 6.10 (provided, that any
action taken at the written request of the Acquiring Parties shall not constitute such breach) to the extent such
breach is the primary cause of the Non-Arriver Extraction being unable to be completed at the time it otherwise
would have been completed following the Closing. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives shall have any obligations under this Section 6.10 following the Effective Time.
(h) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Non-Arriver Extraction is not a condition to the Closing. If the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII of this Agreement have been satisfied or, to the extent not
prohibited by Law, waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent not prohibited by Law, irrevocable waiver of such conditions), but it
is expected that the Non-Arriver Extraction cannot be consummated immediately following the Closing, the
parties to this Agreement shall nevertheless proceed with the Closing if and when required in accordance with
Section 2.2.

“Debt Payoff Amount”). Subject to the Acquiring Parties’ compliance with the previous sentence, the Company
shall pay the Debt Payoff Amount to the counterparties under the Company Debt as promptly as practicable
following the date the Company receives such Debt Payoff Amount. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, or prior to the Closing Date, provide the Acquiring Parties with a customary payoff letter

Disclosure Letter, which Payoff Letter shall set forth the aggregate amount required to satisfy in full all such

all obligations of the Company pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture within the time periods (but at or
prior to the Closing) required by the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture and the Acquiring Parties shall
take all necessary action to perform and comply with its obligations, if any, under the Convertible Notes
Indenture and any supplemental indenture entered into by any of the Acquiring Parties at Closing and such
obligations to be performed thereafter; provided that any opinions of counsel required by the Convertible Notes
Indenture, or as shall be required by the trustee pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, shall be delivered
by the Acquiring Parties and their respective counsel in each case to the extent required by the terms of the

required to take such actions if: (A) it would cause a material violation of any Contract to which Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, or (B) the Company believes in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and
taking into account whether privilege cannot be protected by the Company or its Subsidiaries through exercise of its
or their reasonable efforts (such as redaction of certain information), it would reasonably be expected to cause a risk
of a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination, any amounts owed pursuant to Section 6.10(e)

Acquiring Parties’ receipt in full of (i) the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3 and (ii) Magna Termination
Fee Refund pursuant to Section 8.7, in circumstances where the Termination Fee is owed pursuant to Section
8.3, shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Acquiring Parties and Merger Sub against
the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective direct or indirect, former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or
assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for
a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall also be obligated with
respect to Section 8.3(c), Section 8.6 and Section 8.7, as applicable).
(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 and Section
8.7 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Acquiring Parties in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision and (iii) without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that the Magna Termination Fee Refund shall not constitute a
penalty, but is a refund of amounts previously paid by the Acquiring Parties on behalf of the Company.

in order to obtain such payment, the Acquiring Parties commence a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this Section 8.3 or Section 8.7, the Company shall pay the
Acquiring Parties their costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of two percent (2%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such

by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by
virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

provided that no such disclosure shall qualify Section 4.1 (Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries), Section
4.2(a) (Capitalization) or Section 4.3 (Authority Relative to Agreement) unless it is set forth or specifically cross
referenced in the corresponding Section of the Company Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of any item in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment that the information is required to be
disclosed or admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever.
(c) The words “hereof,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereunder” and “herewith” and words of similar import shall refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word “extent” in the
phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall
not mean simply “if”. References to articles, sections, clauses, paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are
to the articles, sections, clauses and paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement,

phrase “without limitation.” Words describing the singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and
vice versa, words denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural persons
shall be deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. The phrases “the date of this Agreement” and “the date hereof” and terms or phrases
of similar import shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Preamble, unless the context requires
otherwise. When used in reference to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the term “material” shall be measured
against the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. References to any statute shall be deemed to refer
to such statute as amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (provided
that for purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a
specific date or dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). Terms defined in the text of this
Agreement have such meaning throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement, and
all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws (provided that
for purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific
date or dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or

currency of the United States of America. All references to “U.S.” or the “United States” are to the United States
of America, including its territories and possessions. Any reference to “days” means calendar days unless
Business Days are expressly specified. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference
date in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the
period shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified, the words “made available
to,” “delivered to” or “disclosed to” the Acquiring Parties or Merger Sub (or words of similar import) means the
