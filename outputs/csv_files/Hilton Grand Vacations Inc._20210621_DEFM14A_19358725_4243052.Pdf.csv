Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEETING,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEETING
The following are brief answers to certain questions that you may have about the proposals being considered at the special meeting of our
stockholders, which we refer to as the “special meeting.” We urge you to carefully read this entire proxy statement, including its Annexes, and the other
documents to which this proxy statement refers or incorporates by reference, because this section does not provide all of the information that might be
important to you. Also see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference” beginning on page 155 of this
proxy statement.
 
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
 
A:
On March 10, 2021, we, HGV Borrower, Diamond, the Apollo Investors, and the other stockholders of Diamond entered into the merger agreement,
a copy of which is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. The merger agreement provides that we will acquire Diamond in a series of
transactions (the “merger”). After the completion of the merger, Diamond will cease to exist as a separate company and all of its assets and
liabilities will be assumed by HGV Borrower, the surviving entity of the merger, and HGV Borrower will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary
of HGV.
If the merger is completed, the Diamond stockholders are currently expected to receive an aggregate of approximately 34,746,298 shares (based on
calculations as of June 1, 2021) of our common stock par value $0.01 per share (“our common stock”), subject to certain adjustments as a result of
changes in certain liabilities and other items between signing and closing. As a result, based on Diamond’s current capitalization, Diamond
stockholders are expected to receive approximately 0.32022 shares of our common stock (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021) for each share
of Diamond Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Diamond common stock”), other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in the merger
agreement), treasury shares and shares owned directly or indirectly by Diamond, that they own immediately before the merger, subject to
adjustment as a result of changes in certain liabilities and other items between signing and closing of the merger in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement (such ratio, the “exchange ratio”), plus cash for any fractional shares, without interest.
 
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 
A:
You are receiving this proxy statement because you are a stockholder of record of HGV on the record date. This proxy statement serves as the
proxy statement through which we will solicit proxies to obtain the necessary stockholder approval for the proposed issuance of our common
stock to Diamond stockholders in connection with the merger. The merger itself does not require any HGV stockholder approval.
The Diamond stockholders have already approved the merger agreement and the merger, pursuant to a written consent dated March 10, 2021.
Accordingly, there will not be a separate meeting for Diamond stockholders. In addition, Diamond does not file reports with the SEC nor is its
common stock publicly traded on any exchange.
This proxy statement, including its Annexes, contains and incorporates by reference important information about us and Diamond, the merger and
the special meeting. You should read all the available information carefully and in its entirety.
Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible.
 
Q:
When and where will the special meeting be held?
 
A:
The special meeting will be held at 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Orlando, Florida 32839, on July 28, 2021 at 9:00  a.m., Eastern time.
 
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 
A:
Only holders of record of outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on June 1 , 2021, which we refer to as the record
date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.
 
3Table of Contents
Q:
What constitutes a quorum at the special meeting?
 
A:
In accordance with Delaware law (the law under which we are incorporated) and our bylaws, the presence of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is required to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, or if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the special meeting to approve the stock issuance proposal, the special meeting may be adjourned to allow more time for obtaining additional
proxies or votes without further notice other than by announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting at the special meeting, unless
the adjournment is for more than thirty days in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the adjourned meeting. If after the adjournment, a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, our
board of directors will fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting and will give notice of the adjourned meeting to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. At
any subsequent reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original
convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn before the adjourned meeting.
Abstentions (shares of our common stock for which proxies have been received but for which the holders have abstained from voting) will be
included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum has been achieved. However, broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock
represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.
 
Q:
How do I vote my shares of common stock?
 
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote in person by attending the special meeting, or, to ensure your shares are
represented at the special meeting, in advance of the special meeting you may authorize a proxy to vote by:
 
 
•
 accessing the internet website specified on your proxy card and following the on-screen instructions;
 
 
•
 calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card; or
 
 
•
 signing, dating and mailing your proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.
If you are a beneficial owner who holds shares of our common stock in “street name” through a stock brokerage account or through a bank,
broker or other nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to ensure that your shares are
represented at the special meeting. Beneficial owners may vote at the special meeting only if they obtain a legal proxy from their bank, broker or
other nominee before the special meeting.
 
Q:
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
 
A:
Our board of directors, after careful consideration of the various factors described under “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors” beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement, at a meeting held on March 8, 2021, unanimously
determined that the merger agreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders, authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance
of shares of our common stock in the merger, and the other transactions contemplated thereby by a unanimous vote, and adopted resolutions
directing that the stock issuance proposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration and approval.
 
4
Table of Contents
Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the stock issuance proposal, “FOR”
the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
In relation to the compensation proposal, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to
terminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger and, accordingly, we do not anticipate making any change in control
payments, accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to our other named executive officers as a result of the merger.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve each proposal and how are abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes treated?
 
A:
The approval of the stock issuance proposal and the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes
cast and entitled to vote on each proposal. The approval of the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of
the stockholders of a majority in voting power present if a quorum is not present or, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the votes cast. Abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of the stock issuance
proposal, compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
 
Q:
My shares are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee. Will my bank, broker or other nominee automatically vote my
shares for me?
 
A:
No. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial holder” of the shares held for you in
what is known as “street name.” You are not the “record holder” of such shares. If this is the case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to
you by your bank, broker or other nominee. As the beneficial holder, unless your bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority over
your shares, you generally have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting
instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority.
This is often called a “broker non-vote.” With respect to the special meeting, your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary
authority to vote on the stock issuance proposal, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
You should therefore provide your bank, broker or other nominee with instructions as to how to vote your shares of our common stock.
Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee so that it may vote your shares on your behalf. Please note
that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to us or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you
first obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
 
Q:
What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?
 
A:
If you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the
shares of our common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as our board of directors recommends and, therefore, will be voted “FOR”
each of the proposals being submitted to a vote of our common stockholders at the special meeting.
 
Q:
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?
 
A:
Yes, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of
record, you can do this in one of three ways.
 
 
•
 you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date, including by telephone or through the internet before the closing of those voting
facilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021;
 
5
Table of Contents
 
•
 you can send a signed notice of revocation to Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 120, Orlando, Florida 32839,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021; or
 
 
•
 you can attend and vote at the special meeting, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given. Simply attending the special
meeting without voting at the special meeting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or otherwise change your vote.
If you have submitted a proxy for your shares by telephone or via the internet, you may revoke your prior telephone or internet proxy by any
manner described above.
If you are a “beneficial holder” who holds shares of our common stock in “street name,” you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to
change your vote.
 
Q:
Do I need to do anything with my shares of common stock other than voting for the proposals at the special meeting?
 
A:
No. If the merger is consummated, you are not required to take any action with respect to your shares of our common stock.
 
Q:
Do I have appraisal rights?
 
A:
No. You, as an HGV stockholder, do not have appraisal rights as a result of the merger.
 
Q:
How will HGV stockholders be affected by the merger?
 
A:
Upon completion of the merger, each HGV stockholder will hold the same number of shares of our common stock that such stockholder held
immediately prior to completion of the merger. As a result of the merger, our stockholders will own shares in a larger company with more assets.
However, because HGV will be issuing additional shares of our common stock to Diamond stockholders in exchange for their shares of Diamond
common stock, each outstanding share of our common stock immediately prior to the merger will represent a smaller percentage of the aggregate
number of shares of our common stock outstanding after the merger. Our common stock will continue to be traded on the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) following consummation of the merger.
 
Q:
When does HGV expect to complete the merger?
 
A:
We are currently expecting to complete the merger in early August 2021. However, we cannot predict the actual date on which the merger will be
completed, nor can we assure you that the merger will be completed, because completion is subject to conditions beyond either company’s
control. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 102 of this proxy
statement.
 
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A:
If the stock issuance proposal is not approved by our stockholders or the merger is not completed for any other reason, Diamond’s stockholders
will not receive any payment for shares of Diamond common stock that they own. Instead, we will not issue any shares of our common stock as
contemplated by the merger agreement, we will continue to conduct our operations as currently conducted, and Diamond will remain an
independent company.
Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee upon termination of the merger agreement, as described under “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 104 of this proxy statement.
 
6
Table of Contents
Q:
Who will own HGV immediately following the merger?
 
A:
We estimate that, upon completion of the merger, our stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger will own approximately 72% and Diamond
stockholders will own approximately 28% of our total shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021).
 
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to HGV stockholders?
 
A:
Holders of our common stock will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the merger related to their ownership of our common stock.
 
Q:
Who can help answer my questions?
 
A:

Our board of directors, after careful consideration of the various factors described under “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors” beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement, at a meeting held on March 8, 2021, unanimously
determined that the merger agreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement
 
10Table of Contents
are advisable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders, authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance of shares of our
common stock in the merger, and the other transactions contemplated thereby by a unanimous vote, and adopted resolutions directing that the
stock issuance proposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration and approval.
In evaluating the merger, our board of directors consulted with and received the advice of our outside legal and financial advisors, held
discussions with our management and considered a number of factors that it believed supported its decision to approve us entering into the merger
agreement and the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger. These factors included, but were not limited to, those listed in “The
Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Our Board of Directors” beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the stock issuance proposal, “FOR” the compensation
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
In relation to the compensation proposal, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to
terminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger and, accordingly, we do not anticipate making any change in control payments,
accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to our other named executive officers as a result of the merger.

We retained BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”) to act as our financial advisor in connection with the merger based on its qualifications,
expertise and reputation, and its knowledge of our business and affairs and familiarity with us and the industry in which we operate. Among other
experiences, BofA Securities has significant hospitality, gaming and real estate M&A and capital markets experience. At the meeting of our board of
directors on March 8, 2021, BofA Securities rendered its oral opinion to our board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to
the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by us in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to us.
On March 9, 2021, BofA Securities delivered to our board of directors a written opinion, dated March 9, 2021, as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to HGV. The full text of the written opinion, dated March 9, 2021, of BofA
Securities, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review
undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BofA Securities provided its opinion to
our board of directors (in its capacity as such) for the benefit and use of HGV’s board of directors in connection with and for purposes of its
evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and
no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available
to us or in which we might engage or as to the underlying business decision of HGV to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Securities’ opinion
does not address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection
with the stock issuance proposal or any related matter.

have interests in the merger that may be in addition to, or different from, your interests as an HGV stockholder. These interests may create the

RISK FACTORS",29,30
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,RISK FACTORS,"RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including the matters addressed in the section
entitled “Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 36 of this proxy statement, you should carefully consider the following
risks before deciding how to vote. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of HGV and Diamond
because those risks will also affect us on a combined basis after giving effect to the merger. Those risks that relate to us can be found in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and any
amendments thereto, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on
Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy statement
and the other documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information and
Incorporation by Reference” beginning on page 155 of this proxy statement. Finally, because Diamond is privately owned, it does not file SEC reports.
Accordingly, included in the following risks are those that relate specifically to Diamond under “—Risks Related to Diamond.” Due to the fact that our
and Diamond’s businesses are similar, Diamond is also subject to substantially all of the risks that are related to our business that are noted under “—
Risks Related to Our Business.” When reviewing such risks related to our business, you should assume all such risks also relate to Diamond and its
business and operations.
Risks Relating to the Merger
The exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in our stock price.
The calculation of the exchange ratio is pre-determined such that each share of Diamond common stock (other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in
the merger agreement), treasury shares, and shares owned directly or indirectly by Diamond) is currently expected to be converted into the right to
receive 0.32022 shares of our common stock in connection with the merger (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021), subject to certain adjustments as a
result of changes in certain liabilities and other items between signing and closing of the merger. This exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in
the market price of our common stock between the date of signing the merger agreement and completion of the merger.
Changes in the price of our common stock before the closing of the merger will affect the market value of our common stock that Diamond common
stockholders will receive at the closing of the merger. The price of our common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from their prices on the date
the merger agreement was executed, on the date of this proxy statement and on the date of the special meeting. As a result, the value represented by the
exchange ratio will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of our common stock during the period from March 9, 2021, the last
trading day before public announcement of the merger agreement, through June 17, 2021, the latest practicable trading date before the date of this proxy
statement, the exchange ratio represented a value ranging from a high of $14.72 to a low of $12.16 for each share of Diamond common stock, as
determined by reference to the value of merger consideration to be received for each share of Diamond common stock in the merger.
These variations could result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of Diamond or HGV before or following the merger, regulatory
considerations, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond our and Diamond’s control. The merger may be
completed a considerable period after the date of the special meeting. Therefore, at the time of the special meeting, stockholders will not know with
certainty the value of the shares of our common stock that will be issued upon completion of the merger.
 
22Table of Contents
We are subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions, including pending litigation and the risk of additional litigation, while the
merger is pending, which may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, vendors,
customers or others.
Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on relationships with our employees, suppliers, vendors, customers, or others may have an adverse
effect on us. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair Diamond’s and our ability to
attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause suppliers, vendors, customers,
and others that deal with us to seek to change, not renew or discontinue existing business relationships with us.
Employee retention and recruitment may be challenging before the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may have
uncertainty about their future roles with HGV after the merger. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or prospective key
employees are unwilling to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain
with us, our business could be adversely affected.
The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The
diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process
could adversely affect our financial results.
In addition, the merger agreement restricts us and Diamond, without the other party’s consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other
specified actions until the merger closes or the merger agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us and Diamond from pursuing otherwise
attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our respective businesses before completion of the merger or termination of the merger
agreement. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.
One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is the absence of any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, having
been entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition that prevents the consummation of the merger. We and our board of directors were named as defendants in lawsuits brought by purported
HGV stockholders challenging the adequacy of the public disclosures related to the merger and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin us
from completing the merger. If a settlement or other resolution is not reached in these lawsuits and any of the plaintiffs in such pending litigation or in
possible future lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the merger, then such injunction may prevent the
merger from being completed, or delay it from being completed within the expected time frame.
Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and the future of our business and financial results.
If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to several risks, including the following:
 
 
•
 being required to pay a termination fee to Diamond under certain circumstances as provided in the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 having to pay certain costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and other fees and expenses;
 
 
•
 our common stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be
completed; and
 
23
Table of Contents
 
•
 having had the focus of our senior management on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to
us and our stockholders.
If the merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business,
financial results and stock price.
Our ability to complete the merger is subject to certain closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which
may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the merger to be abandoned.
The merger agreement contains certain closing conditions, including, among others:
 
 
•
 the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement, subject to the qualifications
described in more detail herein;
 
 
•
 the other party having performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 the absence of a “material adverse effect” impacting the other party;
 
 
•
 the approval of the stock issuance proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of our common stock at a
stockholders’ meeting duly called and held for such purpose;
 
 
•
 the absence of any judgment, order, law or other legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that
prevents the consummation of the merger;
 
 
•
 the approval for listing by the NYSE of the shares of our common stock issuable in the merger;
 
 
•
 the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act;
 
 
•
 the receipt of all authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, or expirations of waiting periods imposed
by, the COFECE under the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law and the Federal Competition Authority under the Austrian Cartel
Act and the Competition Act;
 
 
•
 certain ancillary agreements having been delivered and not having been rescinded or repudiated by certain parties; and
 
 
•
 the absence of defaults under Diamond’s unsecured notes and absence of defaults and sufficient availability under Diamond’s warehouse
facilities.
We cannot assure you that the various closing conditions will be satisfied, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect us
following the merger or will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger.
We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
While we anticipate certain cost savings from the consummation of the merger, our ability to achieve such estimated cost savings in the timeframe
described, or at all, is subject to various assumptions by our management, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other costs in
our operations that offset all or a portion of such cost savings. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize cost savings within the timeframe
expected or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost savings. Failure to achieve the expected cost
savings could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the merger and adversely affect us.
 
24
Table of Contents
In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. We expect to continue to incur non-recurring costs associated with consummating the merger, combining the
operations of the two companies and achieving the desired cost savings. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The
substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the merger and include, among others, fees paid to financial,
legal and accounting advisors, employee benefit costs and filing fees. These costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses,
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results following the consummation of the merger and many of these costs
will be borne by us even if the merger is not consummated.
Any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits that we expect to achieve.
The merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion
of the merger. We cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize
some or all of the synergies that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within the expected time frame. See the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 102 of this proxy statement.
Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally.
Certain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, and our board of directors unanimously recommended
that our stockholders vote in favor of the stock issuance proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. These directors and
executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders. These interests include the
continued employment of our executive officers after the merger, the continued service of all of our directors following the merger, and other rights held
by our directors and executive officers. Our stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider our board of directors’ recommendation
that they vote in favor of the stock issuance proposal and the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting.
Our board of directors was aware of these potential interests and considered them in making its recommendations to approve the stock issuance
proposal and the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting. The interests of our directors and executive officers are described in more
detail in the sections entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 74 of this proxy
statement.
The opinion obtained by our board of directors from its financial advisor does not and will not reflect changes in circumstances after the date of
such opinion.
On March 9, 2021, BofA Securities delivered an opinion to our board of directors that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject
to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in BofA Securities’ opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial
point of view, to HGV. Changes in the operations and prospects of Diamond or HGV, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may
be beyond our control, and on which the opinion of BofA Securities was based, may alter our or Diamond’s value or the price at which shares of our
common stock are traded by the time the merger is completed. We have not obtained, and we do not expect to request, an updated opinion from our
financial advisor. BofA Securities’ opinion does not speak to the time when the merger will be completed or to any date other than the date of such
opinion. As a result, the opinion does not and will not address the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by us in
the merger pursuant to the merger agreement at the time the merger is completed or at any time other than the date when opinion was rendered. For a more
complete description of the opinion that our board of directors received from our financial advisor and a summary of the material financial

analyses BofA Securities provided to our board of directors in connection with rendering such opinion, please refer to “The Merger—Opinion of Our
Financial Advisor” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement and the full text of such written opinion included as Annex B to this proxy statement.
Risks if the Merger is Completed
We may not be able to integrate successfully and many of the anticipated benefits of combining us and Diamond may not be realized.
We entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits, including, among other things, operating
efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of HGV and
Diamond can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.
It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of
each company’s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation
arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Our results of operations could also be
adversely affected by any issues attributable to Diamond’s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur before the closing of the
merger. We may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The integration process is subject to
a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure
to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected net income and could adversely affect our
future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
Furthermore, we have agreed with Hilton to develop a mutually agreeable plan pursuant to which the Diamond properties are to be operated during
the integration period, and with respect to those Diamond properties that will not be converted to our brand. If we fail to develop such a plan with Hilton,
such properties may remain subject to a number of restrictions related to how they are operated, and such restrictions may reduce the efficiencies
anticipated in connection with the merger.
We will take on additional indebtedness to finance the merger, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations, including by decreasing our business flexibility, as well as our ability to meet payment obligations under our indebtedness.
In connection with the completion of the merger, we intend to significantly increase our level of indebtedness. As part of such plan, we closed an
unregistered offering of $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2029 and priced an unregistered offering of $500 million in
aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2031, which is expected to close on June 28, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Our
increased level of debt, together with certain covenants and restrictions that will be imposed on us in connection with incurring this indebtedness, will,
among other things: (a) require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of debt; (b) reduce funds
available for strategic initiatives and opportunities, dividends, share repurchases, working capital and other general corporate needs; (c) limit our ability
to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness, which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business, industry and
economic conditions and increase borrowing costs; (d) create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels and
(e) increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. These covenants and restrictions may limit how our business is
conducted. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants and restrictions and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain
waivers thereto and/or amend these covenants and restrictions. Our failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions could result in an event of
default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay such indebtedness before its due date or to have to negotiate
amendments to or waivers thereof, which may have unfavorable terms or result in the incurrence of additional fees and expenses.

Our ability to make scheduled cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our
ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future, which, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors, including the continued adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, that are beyond our control.
We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on
our indebtedness.
In addition, our credit ratings will impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings will reflect
each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations on a combined basis with
Diamond. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, operating results and share and debt prices,
as well as our obligations with respect to our capital efficient inventory acquisitions.
The pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our
financial condition or results of operations after the merger.
Our operating results after the merger may be materially different from those shown in the pro forma financial information presented in this proxy
statement, which does not purport to represent what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would actually have been if the merger had
occurred as of the date indicated or what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would be for any future periods. The pro forma
financial information contained in this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only, is based on various adjustments, assumptions,
judgments, and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our future financial condition or results of operations resulting from the merger for
several reasons. See the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information of HGV and Diamond” beginning on
page 136 of this proxy statement. The actual financial condition and results of operations of us following the merger may not be consistent with, or
evident from, this pro forma financial information. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be
accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the completion of the merger. Any potential decline in our
financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in our stock price after merger. The costs, fees and expenses related to the
merger could be higher than currently estimated. Further, because the determination of fair value is dependent upon valuations that must be performed as
of the date the merger is consummated, the valuations underlying the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement may be
revised after the date hereof. Any such adjustments to the preliminary estimates of fair value could be material.
Following the completion of the merger, our vacation ownership business will depend on the quality and reputation of the brands associated with
the portfolios of each of HGV and Diamond, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could adversely affect our market
share, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Following completion of the merger, we intend to offer vacation ownership products and services under the Hilton Vacation Club brand, a new
upscale HGV sub-brand that will consist of rebranded Diamond properties, all pursuant to the Amended and Restated License Agreement with Hilton (the
“A&R Hilton license agreement”). If the quality of any of these brands deteriorates, or the reputation of these brands declines, including as the result of
actions by Hilton, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See “Risks
Related to our Relationship with Hilton” below.
 
27
Table of Contents
The maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties depends on maintenance fees paid by the owners of VOIs.
The maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our and Diamond’s VOIs by property owners’ association boards are used to maintain and
refurbish the vacation ownership properties, to maintain reserves for capital expenditures, and to keep the properties in compliance with applicable brand
standards. Property owners’ association boards may elect to not levy sufficient maintenance fees, or owners of VOIs may fail to pay their maintenance
fees for reasons such as financial hardship, dissatisfaction with the merger or because of damage to their VOIs from natural disasters such as hurricanes.
In these circumstances, not only could our and Diamond’s management fee revenue be adversely affected, but the vacation ownership properties could
fall into disrepair and fail to comply with applicable brand standards. If a resort fails to comply with applicable brand standards, Hilton could terminate our
right under the A&R Hilton license agreement to use its trademarks at the non-compliant resort, which could result in the loss of management fees,
decreased customer satisfaction and impairment of our ability to market and sell products at the non-compliant locations. See “Risks Related to Our
Relationship with Hilton” below.
If maintenance fees at our or Diamond’s resorts are required to be increased, our or Diamond’s products could become less attractive and our or
Diamond’s business could be harmed.
The maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our and Diamond’s VOIs by property owners’ association boards may increase as the costs to
maintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties, to maintain reserves for capital expenditures, and to keep the properties in compliance with
brand standards increase. A similar situation may arise with respect to fees imposed on owners of VOIs with respect to new properties added to our
portfolio following the completion of the merger. Increased maintenance fees could make our or Diamond’s products less desirable, which could have a
negative impact on sales of our or Diamond’s products and could also cause an increase in defaults with respect to our or Diamond’s vacation ownership
notes receivable portfolio.
We will incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the merger.
We expect to incur a number of non-recurring expenses both before and after completing the merger, including fees for third party legal, investment
banking and advisory services, the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in
connection with the merger, obtaining necessary consents and approvals and combining the operations of the two companies. These fees and costs will
be substantial. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in our integration of Diamond. Although it is expected that the elimination of certain
duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction
related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Further, if the merger is not completed, we would have to recognize
these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. See “—Risks Related to the Merger—The pro forma financial information included
in this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations after the
merger” above.
Our stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the completion of the merger and will exercise less influence over
management of us as compared to currently.
Our stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting us. Upon the completion of
the merger, each Diamond stockholder who receives shares of our common stock will become our stockholder. It is currently expected that the former
Diamond stockholders as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 28% of the shares of our common stock on a fully diluted
basis immediately after the completion of the merger. As a result, our current stockholders as a group will own approximately 72% of the shares of our
common stock on a fully diluted
 
28
Table of Contents
basis immediately after the completion of the merger. Because of this, our stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the
combined company than they now have on the management and policies of us prior to the merger.
Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of the merger.
Following the completion of the merger, the size of our business will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or Diamond’s
current operations. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, including in non-US jurisdictions where we
do not currently have operations, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring
of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may also need to obtain approvals of developers or HOAs in various instances to
include additional resorts in the Diamond Collections or increase maintenance fees or impose additional requirements in order to meet our brand and
operating standards. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and
other benefits currently anticipated from the transactions. In addition, there will be increased compliance and regulatory risk as a result of the expanded
size of our business.
We may not be able to retain our and/or Diamond personnel successfully after the merger is completed.
The success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by us and
Diamond. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with us or Diamond, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with us after the
merger is consummated.
If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, our business
activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Diamond to hiring suitable replacements,
all of which may cause our business to suffer. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either
company, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.
We and Diamond may be subject to complaints, litigation or reputational harm due to dissatisfaction with, or concerns related to, the merger from
our current owners.
Our current owners may be concerned about the actual or perceived impact of the merger on their VOIs, including related to a reduced quality of
resorts and product offerings due to the increased size of the business and addition of new owners, or increase or change in HOA or other fees.
Diamond’s current owners may have similar concerns related to a decline in the quality of product offerings or increase in fees as a result of the merger
and increase in size of the business. Complaints or litigation brought by existing owners following the completion of the merger could harm our
reputation, discourage potential new owners and adversely impact our results of operations.
Risks Related to Diamond’s Business
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and will likely continue to have a significant adverse impact on, the business, financial condition and
results of operations of Diamond for the foreseeable future.
Tourism and travel-related industries continue to face significant disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It may be an extended period of
time before the business operations of Diamond and its affiliates return to full operational capacity or occupancy, particularly if there remains lingering
actual and/or perceived concern and perception of significant transmission and infection risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Diamond has implemented
new social distancing, hygiene protocols, and enhanced cleaning measures at its resorts, sales centers, and corporate offices in accordance with
guidelines from federal, state and local authorities. Diamond
 
29
Table of Contents
and its subsidiaries’ management implemented and trained team members on the “Diamond Standard of Clean.” These measures, which are intended to
protect human life, may result in additional costs, operational inefficiencies, and fewer revenue opportunities.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the various governmental mandates and orders for business closure, Diamond temporarily closed
operations at substantially all of their resorts and closed substantially all of their sales centers. With the lifting or easing of such restrictions in certain
locations in the United States, Diamond has re-opened the majority of its resorts and sales centers, albeit at reduced capacity levels and revenue has not
returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, any re-opening of the resorts may be delayed, interrupted or reversed depending on government orders or
recommendations or based on assessments of the state of the pandemic. It may be an extended period of time before the resorts return to pre-pandemic
operational capacity or occupancy, particularly if there remains lingering actual and/or perceived concern and perception of significant transmission and
infection risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including in connection with any variant strains of the virus.
Any sustained materially adverse impact on Diamond’s revenues, net income and other operating results due to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic could cause Diamond to breach its operating and financial covenants under certain of its debt obligations, which may mean lenders have the
right to terminate their commitments under certain debt agreements and declare outstanding loans immediately due and payable.
Diamond operates in a number of locations outside the United States and is subject to certain additional risks related to international operations
that are not applicable to our current business.
Diamond manages resorts in and sells VOIs in countries outside of the United States, including in Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom and
several countries in the European Union, which are subject to a number of risks, including compliance with local regulations and laws, regulations
restricting the sale of VOIs, compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, exposure to local economic
conditions, potential adverse changes in the political or economic relation of foreign countries with the United States, withholding and restrictions on
taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Diamond is and may in the future be subject to litigation in foreign jurisdictions.
In Mexico, the developer of certain of Diamond’s resorts have agreed to requirements that they consider themselves as Mexican nationals with
respect to certain property and agree to not invoke the protection of their governments in matters relating to the property. Generally, rules in Mexico limit
ownership of land near Mexico’s borders and beaches to Mexican citizens and companies, unless granted the right by the Mexican government. If the
developer of Diamond’s resort in Mexico fails to comply with the agreement with the Mexican government, it would forfeit the land back to Mexico.
We do not currently have operations in several of the non-US jurisdictions in which Diamond operates and may lack knowledge or familiarity with
the rules and regulations, as well as experience and resources, related to operating such business in these countries.
Interests in Diamond’s resorts are offered through a trust system, which is subject to a number of regulatory and other requirements.
The Diamond Collections located in the United States are alternatives to traditional deeded timeshare ownership, inasmuch as they create a
network of available resort accommodations at multiple locations. For those United States-based Diamond Collections, title to the units available through
the Diamond Collections is held in a trust or similar arrangement that is administered by an independent trustee (the “Collection Trustee”). A purchaser of
a timeshare interest in a Collection does not receive a deeded interest in any specific resort or resort accommodation, but acquires a membership in the
timeshare plan which is denominated by an annual or biennial allotment of points. Owners of Diamond’s timeshare interests are allowed to use their
allocated points to reserve
 
30
Table of Contents
accommodations at the various component site(s)/participating resort(s) within the Diamond Collections, thereby giving the members greater flexibility to
plan their vacations. Owners may also elect to reserve accommodations at resorts that are not part of their Collection through Diamond’s exchange
programs.
The Diamond Collections are registered pursuant to, exempted from, or otherwise in compliance with, the applicable statutory requirements for the
sale of timeshare plans in a growing number of jurisdictions. Such registrations and formal exemption determinations for the Diamond Collections confirm
the substantial compliance with the filing and disclosure requirements of the respective timeshare statutes by the developer of the applicable Diamond
Collection. It does not constitute the endorsement of the creation, sale, promotion or operation of the Diamond Collections by any regulatory body nor
relieve the developer of a Diamond Collection or any affiliates of such developer of any duty or responsibility under other statutes or any other
applicable laws. Registration under a respective timeshare act (or other applicable law) is not a guarantee or assurance of compliance with applicable law
nor an assurance or guarantee of how any judicial body may interpret the Diamond Collections’ compliance therewith. A determination that specific
provisions or operations of the Collections do not comply with relevant timeshare acts or applicable law may have a material adverse effect on the
developer, the Collection Trustee and the related non-profit members association for each of the Diamond Collections.
Increased activity by third-party exit companies on Diamond and its owners may cause distractions and adversely impact our integration.
Diamond and other timeshare companies continue to be significantly targeted by organized activities of third parties that actively pursue timeshare
owners claiming to provide timeshare interest transfers and/or “exit” services. Any increases in the level of participation by the Diamond owners in
response to such overtures and/or delinquencies or defaults with respect to the timeshare loans owed by such owners may disrupt Diamond’s business,
affect cash flow from collections on the timeshare loans, and generally adversely affect our integration plans of Diamond. In addition, exit companies may
target HGV owners to a greater extent than they already do in light of the proposed merger with Diamond.
Risks Related to Our Relationship with Hilton
Our future results may suffer if Hilton seeks to modify or terminate the A&R Hilton license agreement.
We are a party to a license agreement with Hilton under which we license substantially all of the trademarks, brand names and intellectual property
used in our business. The A&R Hilton license agreement also permits us to utilize the Hilton Honors program, which is a valuable asset for lead
generation. These assets are critical to our business and the modification or amendment the A&R Hilton license agreement or any exercise by Hilton of its
termination or other rights under the A&R Hilton license agreement will materially impact our business. The termination or amendment of the A&R Hilton
license agreement in whole or in part could result in the loss of the right of HGV to use the Hilton brands in our business as currently conducted as well
as in connection with our post-combination business, and in related services offered by Hilton, including marketing channels and guest loyalty programs.
The loss of such rights will materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our VOI products and maintain
our competitive position, and will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, it is likely to be
very challenging for us to find or develop a comparable replacement for the Hilton brand and the A&R Hilton license agreement. In addition, we may
incur liabilities if any such termination results from our alleged breach of the A&R Hilton license agreement.
If the A&R Hilton license agreement is terminated, we may lose our rights to certain brands developed by us in connection with the integration of the
Diamond business.
Pursuant to the A&R Hilton license agreement, Hilton would be the sole owner of certain licensed marks related to new brands associated with the
Diamond portfolio that are developed by us in connection with our
 
31
Table of Contents
post-combination business. If, following the completion of the merger, we default under the A&R Hilton license agreement, we could lose the right to use
one or more of such new brands. The loss of these rights and/or certain other related rights could materially adversely affect our ability to generate
revenue and profits from the vacation ownership business associated with the Diamond portfolio. The termination of the A&R Hilton license agreement
following completion of the merger would materially harm our combined business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our
products and maintain our competitive position.
Our ability to integrate the Diamond business and otherwise expand our business and remain competitive could be harmed if Hilton does not
consent to the use of their trademarks in connection with the conversion of Diamond properties and/or new resorts that we may acquire or develop in
the future.
Under the terms of the A&R Hilton license agreement, we must obtain Hilton’s approval to use the Hilton brand names and trademarks in
connection with the conversion of the Diamond properties to branded properties using the Hilton marks, as well as for the branding of timeshare
properties that we acquire or develop in the future. If Hilton does not permit us to use its trademarks in connection with such conversion and integration
on a timely basis or at all, or in connection with any other timeshare properties that we may acquire in the future pursuant to any future development or
acquisition plans, or if we cannot come to an agreement with Hilton on how to brand and operate Diamond properties that are not approved by Hilton,
our ability to successfully integrate Diamond and otherwise expand our business and remain competitive may be materially adversely affected. The
requirement to obtain approval for such conversion and integration of Diamond properties and any future expansion plans, or the need to identify and
secure alternative solutions because we cannot obtain such approval, may delay implementation of our integration and/or expansion plans or cause us to
incur additional expense related to the branding of our properties.
Our ability to integrate the Diamond business depends on our compliance with the A&R Hilton license agreement, including the “Separate
Operations” provisions and certain prohibitions on doing business with competitors. While the parties intend to provide some revisions to the
applicable requirements, strict compliance with such provisions will negatively impact the synergies and efficiencies related to the Diamond
acquisition.
For now, we have agreed with Hilton to operate the Diamond business as a “Separate Operation” under the A&R Hilton license agreement.
Complying with that requirement can be costly and difficult and will likely significantly diminish the efficiencies and synergies that are critical to our
successful integration of the Diamond business. In addition, the A&R Hilton license agreement requires Hilton’s approval in connection with our
anticipated conversion of the Diamond properties into our branded properties and/or Hilton Vacation Club or another new brand of properties, and the
creation of any such new brand also requires Hilton’s consent. While we and Hilton have agreed to modify the Separate Operations requirements, with
such modifications to be made in Hilton’s sole discretion, so as to allow us to achieve greater operating efficiency and synergy than currently provided
for, any failure of the parties to do so will adversely impact such operating efficiency and synergy. In addition, any failure to obtain Hilton’s approval with
respect to the creation of any new brand or the conversion of the Diamond properties into such new brand or existing branded properties will
significantly harm our ability to integrate the Diamond business and its properties. If we cannot come to an agreement with Hilton on how to brand and
operate Diamond properties that do not currently or will not in the future meet the Hilton brand standards, then we will be required to continue to operate
them as separate operations.
In addition, the A&R Hilton license agreement contains a number of prohibitions on us entering into certain agreements and arrangements with
competitors of Hilton. As a result of the merger, we will assume Diamond’s contracts with third parties, a number which are with competitors of Hilton and
are prohibited under the A&R Hilton license agreement. The A&R Hilton license agreement provides for a cure period for agreements or arrangements
related to the Diamond business that would result in a violation or breach of provisions in the A&R Hilton license agreement. However, to the extent we
are not able to terminate such agreements within the cure period or we are unable to obtain a waiver from Hilton, we may breach the A&R Hilton license
agreement.

We are a timeshare company that markets and sells VOIs, manages resorts in top leisure and urban destinations, and operates a points-based
vacation club. As of March 31, 2021, we had 62 properties, representing 499,616 are primarily located in vacation destinations such as Orlando, Las Vegas,
the Hawaiian Islands, New York City, Washington D.C., South Carolina, Barbados and Mexico and feature spacious, condominium-style accommodations
with superior amenities and quality service. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 330,000 Club members. Club members have the flexibility to
exchange their VOIs for stays at any Hilton Grand Vacations resort or any property in the Hilton system of 18 industry-leading brands across
approximately 6,500 properties, as well as numerous experiential vacation options, such as cruises and guided tours.
Our compelling VOI product allows customers to advance purchase a lifetime of vacations. Because our VOI owners generally purchase only the
vacation time they intend to use each year, they are able to efficiently split the full cost of owning and maintaining a vacation residence with other
owners. Our customers also benefit from the high-quality amenities and service at our Hilton-branded resorts. Furthermore, our points-based platform
offers members flexibility, enabling us to more effectively adapt to their changing vacation needs over time. Building on the strength of that platform, we
continuously seek new ways to add value to our Club membership, including enhanced product offerings, greater geographic distribution, broader
exchange networks and further technological innovation, all of which drive better, more personalized vacation experiences and guest satisfaction.
We operate our business across two segments: real estate sales and financing and resort operations and club management. Our real estate sales
and financing segment primarily generates revenue from VOI sales and consumer financing in connection with such sales, and our resort operations and
club management segment primarily generates revenue from resort management, Club management and transient rental of available VOI inventory.
On January 3, 2017, Hilton completed a tax-free spin-off of HGV and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. As a result of the spin-off, HGV became an
independent publicly-traded company. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “HGV.”

THE SPECIAL MEETING",44,46
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,THE SPECIAL MEETING,"THE SPECIAL MEETING
This proxy statement is being provided to our stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by our board of directors for use at the special
meeting to be held at the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement thereof. This
proxy statement and the information incorporated by reference herein provides our stockholders with the information they need to know to be able to
vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting.
Date, Time and Place
The special meeting is scheduled to be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, on July 28, 2021 at 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Orlando, Florida 32839.
Purpose of the HGV Special Meeting
At the special meeting, and any adjournments or postponements thereof, you will be asked to consider and vote on:
 
 
•
 the stock issuance proposal;
 
 
•
 the compensation proposal; and
 
 
•
 the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock
issuance proposal.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors, after careful consideration of the various factors described under “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation
of Our Board of Directors” beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement, at a meeting held on March 8, 2021, unanimously determined that the merger
agreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and
in the best interests of us and our stockholders; authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by a unanimous vote; and adopted resolutions directing that the stock issuance
proposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration.
In evaluating the merger, our board of directors consulted with and received the advice of our outside legal and financial advisors, held discussions
with our management and considered a number of factors that it believed supported its decision to enter into the merger agreement. These factors
included, but were not limited to, those listed in “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Our Board of Directors” beginning on
page 56 of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the stock issuance proposal, “FOR” the compensation
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
In relation to the compensation proposal, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to
terminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger and, accordingly, we do not anticipate making any change in control payments,
accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to our other named executive officers as a result of the merger.
Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote
Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on June 1, 2021, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting, or any adjournment or
 
38Table of Contents
postponement thereof. At the close of business on the record date, 85,718,663 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and held by six
holders of record. In addition, many brokers, banks and other institutions hold shares of common stock as nominees for beneficial owners that deposit
these shares of common stock in participant accounts at the Depository Trust Company.
Holders of record of our common stock on the record date are entitled to one vote per share at the special meeting on each proposal. A list of the
names of our stockholders of record will be open to the examination by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the special meeting for ten days
before the special meeting during regular business hours at our headquarters, 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 120, Orlando, Florida 32839. The HGV
stockholder list will also be available at the special meeting for examination by any stockholder present at such meeting.
Voting by our Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the record date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote 1,483,245 shares of our common stock, or
approximately 1.7% of the shares of our common stock outstanding on that date. We currently expect that all of our directors and executive officers will
vote their shares in favor of each proposal being submitted to a vote of our stockholders at the special meeting, although none of them has entered into
any agreement obligating them to do so.
Quorum
No business may be transacted at the special meeting unless a quorum is present. The presence of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is required to constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, or if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
approve the stock issuance proposal, the special meeting may be adjourned to allow more time for obtaining additional proxies or votes. At any
subsequent reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of
the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn before the adjourned meeting.
Abstentions (shares of our common stock for which proxies have been received but for which the holders have abstained from voting) will be
included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum has been achieved. However, broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock represented
at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.
Required Vote
The approval of the stock issuance proposal and the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes
cast. The approval of the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of the stockholders of a majority in voting
power present if a quorum is not present, or, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast. Failures to vote and
broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the stock issuance proposal, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Failure to Vote, Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions
If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by another nominee, you must provide the record
holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee. You may not vote shares of our common stock held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to HGV or by voting at the special meeting
unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must first obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee.
 
39
Table of Contents
Banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares of our common stock in street name for a beneficial owner typically have the authority to vote in
their discretion on “routine” proposals, even when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers or other
nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are determined to be “non-routine” without specific instructions from the
beneficial owner. A “broker non-vote” is a vote that, in accordance with stock exchange rules, is not cast by a broker on a non-routine matter because the
bank, broker or other nominee has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and the bank,
broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.
Under the written rules of the NYSE, banks, brokers or other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be
voted upon at this special meeting. Therefore, if you are an HGV stockholder who holds shares in “street name” and you do not instruct your bank,
broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of these proposals, and the
resulting broker non-vote will have no effect on these proposals.
Instructions to “ABSTAIN” for each proposal to be voted upon at the special meeting will be counted for purposes of determining the number of
shares present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Abstentions will not be included in the vote totals for each proposal and will
have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposals. If you return your signed proxy card but do not mark the boxes indicating how you wish to
vote, your shares will be voted “FOR” the stock issuance proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal, on an advisory basis, and, if necessary or
appropriate, “FOR” any proposal to adjourn the special meeting.
Voting at the Special Meeting
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote your shares. If you are a registered or “record” holder, which means your shares
are registered in your name with EQ Shareowner Services, our transfer agent, you may vote in person at the special meeting or be represented by proxy. If
your shares are held in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record in an account with a bank, broker or other nominee, you must follow
the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote, and must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee in order
to vote in person at the special meeting. Please contact your bank, broker or other nominee for further information on how to obtain such legal proxy. You
will not be able to vote your shares at the special meeting without a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not plan to attend the
special meeting or do not wish to vote at the special meeting, you may authorize proxies to vote your shares by written proxy, by telephone or over the
internet.
Voting by Proxy
You should vote your proxy in advance of the meeting even if you plan to attend the special meeting. If you are an HGV stockholder of record, a
proxy card is enclosed for your use. If you wish to authorize proxies to vote your shares by telephone or over the internet, you may use the toll-free
telephone number or access the electronic link to the proxy voting site by following the instructions on the proxy card. Our stockholders of record may
also submit their proxies through the mail by completing the enclosed proxy card, and signing, dating and returning it in the enclosed, pre-addressed,
postage-paid envelope. To be valid, a returned proxy card must be signed.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in street name (i.e., through a bank, broker or other nominee), you will find enclosed instructions from
your bank, broker or other nominee that you must follow in order to vote your shares. You may authorize proxies to vote your shares by telephone or
over the internet if your bank, broker or other nominee makes these methods available, as detailed on the enclosed voting instruction form. You may also
return your voting instructions by signing, dating and returning the enclosed voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided.
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDINGLY, PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR PROXY PROMPTLY, BY TELEPHONE, INTERNET OR MAIL
WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING.

Table of Contents
How Proxies are Counted
All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the manner specified by
the stockholders giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” each of the proposals
covered by this proxy statement.
Only shares affirmatively voted for the proposals, and properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions, will be counted as “FOR”
the proposals submitted by us as described in this proxy statement. Abstentions will not be included in the vote totals for each proposal and will have no
effect on the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals. Failures to vote and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of any of the
proposals.
Revocation of Proxies
You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record,
you can do this in one of three ways:
 
 
•
 you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date, including by telephone or through the internet before the closing of those voting
facilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021;
 
 
•
 you can send a signed notice of revocation to Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 120, Orlando, Florida 32839,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021; or
 
 
•
 you can attend and vote at the special meeting, which will revoke any proxy previously given. Simply attending the special meeting without
voting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or otherwise change your vote.
A registered stockholder may revoke a proxy by any of these methods, regardless of the method used to deliver the stockholder’s previous proxy.
If you are a “beneficial holder” who holds shares of our common stock in “street name,” you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to
change your vote. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you decide to change your vote by attending the special
meeting and voting in person at the special meeting, you will not be able to vote unless you have obtained and present a legal proxy issued in your name
from the record holder (your bank, broker or nominee).
Tabulation of Votes
A representative of Broadridge will serve as the Inspector of Election for the special meeting and will independently tabulate affirmative and
negative votes and abstentions.
Solicitation of Proxies
We are soliciting proxies for the special meeting from our stockholders. We will pay our own cost of soliciting proxies, including the cost of mailing
this proxy statement, from our stockholders. In addition to solicitation by use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by each of our directors and certain
members of our management team, each of whom may be deemed a participant in this solicitation, in person or by telephone or other means of
communication. These persons will not receive additional compensation, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection
with this solicitation.
We have retained Okapi Partners LLC to provide investor response services and assist in the solicitation of proxies at a solicitation fee of up to
$45,000, plus related reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to
forward proxy solicitation materials
 
41
Table of Contents
to beneficial owners of shares held of record by them. We will also reimburse these brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their
reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy materials.
Adjournments
Any adjournment of the special meeting may be made from time to time by the chairman of the meeting or, if a quorum is not present, a majority in
voting power of the stockholders present, or if a quorum is present, the holders of a majority of the votes cast without further notice other than by an
announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting made at the special meeting; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than
thirty days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, our board of directors shall fix a new record date for
notice of such adjourned meeting and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting
as of the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the special meeting to approve the stock issuance proposal, then our stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the special meeting
so as to permit the further solicitation of proxies.

The following is a discussion of the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement between us, Diamond and Diamond’s stockholders. We
urge you to carefully read the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated by
reference herein.
Effect of the Merger",51,51
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,Effect of the Merger,"Effect of the Merger
The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with the
DGCL, we will acquire Diamond in a series of transactions, which are referred to as the merger.
As part of a series of transactions leading to the merger, (i) Dakota Intermediate, Inc., a Delaware corporation, will merge with and into Diamond,
with the latter surviving; (ii) thereafter, Dakota Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation, will merge with and into Diamond, with the latter surviving; and
(iii) thereafter, DRI will merge with and into Diamond, with the latter surviving.
At closing, Diamond will be merged with and into HGV Borrower, with HGV Borrower surviving the merger and continuing to exist as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of HGV. As a result of the merger, (i) each share of Diamond common stock (other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in the merger
agreement), treasury shares and shares owned directly or indirectly by Diamond) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and
(ii) each in-the-money option, whether vested or unvested, will automatically cease to be outstanding and be converted into and exchanged for the right
to receive, without any interest thereon, a number of shares of our common stock and/or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock equal
to the option consideration (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions applicable to such in-the-money option).
Background of the Merger",51,51
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
After our spin-off from Hilton in January 2017 to become an independent, publicly-traded company, our newly constituted board of directors and
senior management focused on ensuring appropriate corporate governance and board oversight, financial reporting, internal controls over financial
reporting, investor communications, and other significant areas that are critical to the success of a new public company. With oversight from our board of
directors, our senior management prioritized proper execution and management of our core business and fully leveraging our license arrangement with
Hilton. During the course of 2017 and early 2018, two of our significant stockholders, The Blackstone Group and its affiliates (“Blackstone”), which
owned an aggregate of approximately 40% of our common stock immediately after the spin-off, and HNA Group and its affiliates (“HNA”), which owned
24% of our common stock as a result of their purchase of our shares of common stock from Blackstone, sold all of their interests in us in multiple public
offerings. As a result, one director who was designated by Blackstone and two directors (one independent and one affiliate) designated by HNA had
either resigned from our board of directors or elected not to stand for re-election by May 2018.
Thereafter, our board of directors and senior management focused on the overall strategic direction of the company, and on an ongoing basis, our
board of directors and senior management team reviewed our performance and future growth prospects, and considered potential opportunities to
strengthen our businesses and enhance stockholder value, including the review of our strategy on a standalone basis and potential opportunities for
business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.
Starting in the summer of 2019, as part of our ongoing strategic evaluation, we explored different potential strategic alternatives, including
acquisitions, combinations, sale and similar transactions, and engaged in discussions with several interested parties, including with Apollo and Diamond.
As part of such discussions with Apollo and Diamond, Mr. Mark Wang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Michael Flaskey, Chief Executive
Officer of Diamond, and Mr. David Sambur, Co-Lead Partner of Private Equity at Apollo, considered our and Diamond’s respective businesses, as well as
potential opportunities, including a combination structure involving us and Diamond.
 
43Table of Contents
As part of such discussion to explore a potential transaction, we, Apollo and Diamond entered into confidentiality agreements in September 2019.
In addition, we, together with BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”), our financial advisor for such strategic evaluation, and our legal advisors, and
Apollo and Diamond, together with their financial and legal advisors, conducted due diligence of each other. Our discussions and mutual diligence with
Apollo and Diamond lasted through the end of 2019 and into March of 2020. At the time, our board of directors had selected BofA Securities to act as our
financial advisor based on, among other things, its qualifications, expertise and reputation, and its knowledge of our business and affairs and familiarity
with us and the industry in which we operate. Among other experiences, BofA Securities had significant hospitality, gaming and real estate M&A and
capital markets experience. BofA Securities and its affiliates also had served as a key lead bank in our credit facility syndicate of banks and lead
underwriter under our ABS program. As part of such engagement, our board of directors evaluated whether BofA Securities had any material conflicts
with respect to the parties involved or potentially involved.
While such discussions and strategic explorations were continuing, in late February 2020 and early March 2020, positive cases of the COVID-19
virus began to proliferate rapidly around the world. During the same period, global travel, leisure, hospitality, and other related sectors began to
experience significant disruptions due to the continued unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continued to spread, more and more
countries began to impose quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and similar restrictions, including restrictions on travel, which only exacerbated already
significant disruptions on the global health, social, economic, and political sectors. Between mid-February 2020 through March 2020, the global stock
markets began to experience significant volatility due to the pandemic and its widespread impact. On March 9, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(“DJIA”) lost more than 2,000 points in one day, the biggest one-day drop in its history. In barely four trading days, the DJIA plunged 6,400 points, an
equivalent to approximately 26% of the total market value. Foreign stock markets experienced similar drops and volatility, including London’s FTSE 100
which lost more than 7.7% in one trading day.
The pandemic triggered a worldwide health, financial and economic crisis, including in the United States. During the ensuing months, as more and
more U.S. local and state government agencies adopted quarantine and similar orders, a substantial number of hospitality, travel, and leisure businesses
were forced to shut down.
The impact on our business and our stock price was no less severe. Our stock price dropped more than 68% from $32.97 on February 14, 2020, prior
to the onset of the pandemic, to $10.53 on March 18, 2020. By the end of April 2020, in response to the pandemic and the governmental quarantine and
similar orders, we closed virtually all of our properties and sales center operations. Like many other companies, we began to take a number of significant
steps to preserve our business and liquidity in response to the pandemic and protect our stockholders, including drawing on our available amounts
under our credit facility to maximize liquidity, making significant cuts to capital and inventory spending, amending our credit and warehouse facilities to
provide temporary relief from financial and other covenant compliance, implementing furloughs and, eventually, workforce reductions, implementing
salary cuts, including for our executive officers and directors, and adopting a stockholder rights plan. Our focus rapidly pivoted to safeguarding our
owners, guests and team members, and, eventually, re-opening properties, sales locations and offices while protecting our owners, guests and team
members, while implementing steps to create incremental value, including repeat owner sales with new inventory offerings, preservation of future tours
by extending travel dates, ongoing work on new product offerings and partnerships, and expansion of our new virtual sales model. Accordingly, during
this time, we ceased all review and exploration of, and discussions with third parties regarding potential strategic alternatives, financing and similar
transactions.
As we began to re-open our properties, sales locations and offices in early June 2020 and worked towards returning to more normal business
operations and conditions, Mr. Wang and the rest of our senior management team evaluated our strategic and capital allocation goals and options,
including the possible acquisition of Diamond. Mr. Wang believed that combining our and Diamond’s businesses could help further drive our business to
return to growth and achieve faster recovery from the pandemic in light of the complementary mix of
 
44
Table of Contents
properties between the two companies and resort locations. In early June, Mr. Wang discussed with representatives from BofA Securities the possibility
of us acquiring Diamond. Shortly thereafter, BofA Securities contacted Mr. Sambur on our behalf to gauge Apollo’s interest in selling all of the Apollo
Investors’ interests in Diamond to us, with Mr. Sambur indicating that he would be interested in exploring such a transaction.
On June 9, 2020, Mr. Sambur presented to Mr. Wang Apollo’s preliminary thoughts on a hypothetical all-stock combination transaction involving
HGV and Diamond that could potentially create significant value for both companies’ stockholders and achieve certain synergies on a combined basis.
Being keenly aware of the disruption that the pandemic had caused in the travel, leisure and lodging sectors, they agreed there could be potential added
benefits of combining the two companies once the severity of the pandemic receded and consumers re-commenced leisure travel. Afterwards, Mr. Wang
and the rest of our senior management discussed with BofA Securities the possibility of our acquisition of Diamond, potential valuation, and structure.
Between June 19, 2020 and June 25, 2020, our senior management met with representatives of BofA Securities numerous times to discuss the
potential acquisition, synergies, capital structure, and diligence involving Diamond.
Based on such discussions, on June 25, 2020, BofA Securities, on our behalf, presented to Apollo an illustrative transaction structure whereby we
would acquire 100% of the equity interest in Diamond in an all-stock transaction in exchange for approximately 29% of the total ownership in the
combined company representing an equity value of approximately $935.0 million at the then-current trading price comprised of an upfront payment in our
common stock valued at $497.0 million for approximately 22% equity interest, plus deferred contingent payment of $438.0 million for an additional 7%
equity interest in the form of warrants or similar instruments, which would be payable in a series of tranches when our stock price crosses certain
thresholds, for 50% of the value of the expected cost synergy. Such structure and potential consideration were based on limited financial information and
prior to any formal financial or legal diligence, and were intended for further discussion and evaluation purposes only.
Between June 26, 2020 and July 31, 2020, our senior management continued to meet with representatives of BofA Securities numerous times to
discuss the potential acquisition involving Diamond.
On August 5, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting, our board of directors met with representatives of our senior management to discuss the state
of the timeshare industry during the pandemic, the potential recovery timeline, a potential acquisition of Diamond, and other potential value-creating
opportunities with respect to an acquisition involving Diamond. Following discussion, our board of directors agreed our senior management should
continue to explore such an opportunity with Apollo and Diamond’s management.
On August 11, 2020, our senior management informed senior management of Hilton that we were considering a potential acquisition of Diamond.
Our senior management and the senior management of Hilton discussed the strategic merits and risks of the proposed transaction. Among other matters,
we discussed Hilton’s consent that would be required under the license agreement for the acquisition, and the need to explore certain modification to the
current license agreement to allow us to achieve desired synergy and value in connection such potential transaction.
On August 14, 2020, our senior management, BofA Securities, and certain representatives of Apollo held a telephone conference to discuss
preliminary scope of due diligence, including our initial critical request list.
Shortly afterwards, on August 18, 2020, our senior management, BofA Securities, representatives of Apollo, and senior management of Diamond
held a call to discuss an overview of our rebranding and brand integration planning and strategy as part of any acquisition of Diamond by us.
Starting on August 21, 2020, we and BofA Securities were given access to Diamond’s electronic data room. Our senior management, certain of our
senior team members who were privy to such evaluation, and BofA Securities commenced financial diligence of Diamond based on available information
in the data room.
 
45
Table of Contents
Between August 27, 2020 and September 25, 2020, certain representatives from our senior management, Apollo, Diamond, BofA Securities, and
Credit Suisse, financial advisor to Diamond, participated in a number of telephonic meetings to continue our discussions on exploring a possible
acquisition transaction and covered a number of topics, including operational and financial diligence, financial projections, valuations and potential
synergies.
On September 23, 2020, as we continued our discussions with Apollo and Diamond, Diamond provided us with financial forecasts through the
electronic data room for our review and evaluation. Our senior management reviewed the materials, together with other existing materials, and continued
to discuss the potential valuation and feasibility of a transaction with representatives of BofA Securities.
On October 5, 2020, our senior management met again with senior management of Hilton to present our rebranding and repositioning strategy to
integrate Diamond. During the meeting, we discussed the potential that the transaction might cause our timeshare business to grow, to the benefit of both
HGV and Hilton. We also discussed a “ramp-up” of the license fee under the Hilton license agreement that would be applicable with respect to the
integration of the Diamond business into our platform.
On October 9, 2020, our board of directors discussed via teleconference with our senior management and representatives of BofA Securities to
receive an update from our senior management and BofA Securities regarding general strategic and financial considerations relating to a potential
acquisition of Diamond and related discussions with Apollo and Diamond. Our senior management discussed with our board of directors preliminary
strategic and economic rationales, as well as potential risks, for pursuing such acquisition. In addition, our senior management, together with
representatives from BofA Securities, provided to our board of directors an overview of the Diamond projections, our and BofA Securities’ preliminary
revisions to such projections, our projections, and preliminary valuation of Diamond. In addition, based on such preliminary evaluation, our senior
management presented an overview of a potential all-stock acquisition of Diamond at an equity value of approximately $840.0 million, comprised of
upfront and deferred contingent payments. Our board of directors agreed that our senior management should continue to explore a possible acquisition
of Diamond and to submit a preliminary, non-binding proposal to Apollo reflecting such structure.
On October 19, 2020, BofA Securities presented to Apollo and Credit Suisse a non-binding proposal on behalf of HGV regarding a potential
acquisition by us of 100% of the equity interests of Diamond in an all-stock transaction whereby the former Diamond stockholders would own an
aggregate of approximately 28% of the total ownership in the combined company (representing an equity value of approximately $838.0 million at the
then-current trading price), comprised of an upfront payment in our common stock valued at $466.0 million for approximately 20% equity interest, plus a
deferred contingent payment of $372.0 million for an additional 8% equity interest in the form of warrants or similar instruments for 50% of the value of the
expected cost synergy. As an alternative, the warrants could be payable in a series of tranches when our stock price crossed certain thresholds.
In addition, on October 19, 2020, our senior management again met with senior management of Hilton during which our senior management
presented a preliminary ramp-up license fee structure proposal with respect to the Diamond acquisition during the integration of the Diamond business
and other related matters, and discussed Hilton’s consent that would be required under the license agreement for the acquisition.
On October 23, 2020, our senior management held a telephonic call with representatives from Apollo and Diamond to discuss both companies’
projections, business prospects, and potential cost and revenue synergies.
Throughout October 2020, our senior management continued to refine synergy assumptions, Hilton license fee modeling, and rebranding strategy.
We responded to information requests from Apollo, Diamond, Credit Suisse, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, Diamond’s tax and accounting advisor, as well
as Hilton. We also made information and diligence requests to Apollo, Diamond and its advisors. During this time, our senior

management also engaged in discussions with BofA Securities regarding financial and cost synergies of the transaction, as well as debt financing
strategy to consummate the Diamond acquisition, including bridge financing.
On November 3, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting, our board of directors met with our senior management to discuss further updates on
discussions between us and Apollo and Diamond regarding our potential acquisition of Diamond.
On November 10, 2020, Diamond and Credit Suisse presented certain updates to Diamond’s forecast of 2022 adjusted EBITDA and explained the
basis for such changes to our senior management and BofA Securities, noting that such changes were being principally driven by changes in their own
projections based on favorable recovery trends from the pandemic disruptions. Our senior management and BofA Securities continued to discuss and
evaluate such changes presented by Diamond, including forming their own independent views of the recovery trends and basis for such changes in the
Diamond projections.
On November 15, 2020, Credit Suisse, on behalf of Diamond, delivered a non-binding proposal for a transaction whereby we would acquire
Diamond for a consideration to be comprised of a combination of our common stock and $250.0 million of convertible notes with a 25% conversion
premium. In exchange, assuming full conversion of the convertible notes, the former Diamond stockholders would own approximately 37% of our
outstanding shares of common stock (having an equity value of approximately $1.22 billion). The shares of our common stock to be issued upfront would
be equal to approximately 33% of our outstanding stock after the transaction (having an equity value of approximately $1.039 billion based on our stock’s
volume weighed average price for a 2 week-period prior to the date of the offer), plus an additional 4% of our outstanding stock after the transaction
(having an additional equity value of approximately $183.0 million) assuming full conversion of the convertible notes.
On November 17, 2020, Mr. Wang and Mr. Sambur spoke about the November 15 proposal and the November 10 forecast. Subsequently, on
November 20, 2020, Mr. Wang received from Mr. Sambur certain supplemental information with respect to the November 10 forecast. Our senior
management and BofA Securities continued to discuss and evaluate such changes, together with such additional information provided by Diamond, and
continued to form and apply their own independent views for the basis of such changes and the supplemental information.
After further discussion with BofA Securities and internal discussions and evaluation, our senior management authorized BofA Securities to inform
Apollo that we were not willing to proceed on the terms outlined in the November 15 offer and instead instructed BofA Securities to present, on
November 30, 2020, a counteroffer to Apollo of a transaction whereby the former Diamond stockholders would own approximately 29% of our
outstanding shares of common stock (having an equity value of approximately $975.0 million at the then-current market price), but with no convertible
note feature. This counteroffer was reiterated by Mr. Wang directly to Mr. Sambur via telephone conversation on November 30.
On December 4, 2020, our senior management met again with Hilton’s senior management to present a revised license fee structure proposal with
respect to the Diamond acquisition. Among other items, the proposal reflected the ramp-up fee structure over the initial five-year period following the
closing of the transaction based on sales of new brand club membership and property revenues associated with Diamond properties that convert into
HGV/Hilton licensed properties.
On December 6, 2020, we received from Credit Suisse, on behalf of Diamond, a counteroffer to our November 30 offer that reflected the former
Diamond stockholders acquiring approximately a 33% interest in our company upon the closing of the transaction (having an equity value of
approximately $1.20 billion at the then-current market price). Subsequently, on December 8, 2020, Mr. Wang spoke to Mr. Sambur about the latest
counteroffer and indicated that we were unwilling to proceed or continue our discussions based on such valuation.

Table of Contents
On December 11, 2020, our senior management, Diamond’ senior management, and representatives from BofA Securities and Credit Suisse held a
telephone meeting to discuss certain preliminary financing considerations in connection with a possible transaction, including scope and structure of
potential financing alternatives.
On December 14, 2020, Credit Suisse, on behalf of Diamond, presented an updated version of its December 6 counteroffer that reflected the former
Diamond stockholders acquiring approximately a 31% interest in our company (having an equity value of approximately $1.115 billion at the then-current
market price). Apollo also proposed an alternative financing structure whereby all existing indebtedness of HGV and Diamond would remain outstanding
after the transaction other than the redemption of our outstanding $300.0 million senior notes, for which the Apollo Funds would provide a backstop to
eliminate our need for bridge financing. However, after diligence, we concluded that it would not be feasible nor desirable to have all of Diamond’s
indebtedness remain outstanding after the transaction due to a number of reasons, including change in control and similar triggers, unfavorable pricing,
and terms of such indebtedness. Apollo and Credit Suisse also provided an estimated timeline for completing all financial and legal due diligence and
potential signing of a definitive agreement.
After evaluation and consultation with our advisors, including with BofA Securities, on December 15, 2020, our senior management responded to
Apollo with a non-binding, “best and final” offer of an all-stock acquisition that would result in the former Diamond stockholders acquiring approximately
a 29.7% interest in the combined company (reflecting an equity value of approximately $1.05 billion at the then-current market price) upon the closing of
the transaction. Apollo preliminarily accepted the offer, subject to continued diligence by both parties. Afterwards, the parties agreed to accelerate their
respective financial and legal diligence efforts and, subject to our board of directors’ concurrence, work towards a definitive agreement on an expedited
basis.
On December 18, 2020, our senior management met with representatives of PJT Partners, a financial advisor that we had retained to assist us in
exploring different financing alternatives, to discuss potential debt structures for the transaction. Subsequently, our senior management continued to
explore various financing structures and alternatives for the transaction in parallel to our discussions with Apollo regarding our acquisition of Diamond.
On December 22, 2020, a special meeting was convened for our board of directors at which our senior management and representatives of BofA
Securities updated the board on the recent discussions and negotiations with Apollo and Diamond that culminated with the non-binding offer on
December 15. After consideration, our board of directors instructed management to continue exploring a possible transaction on the terms outlined in the
December 15 proposal. BofA Securities summarized for our board of directors the process to date and the likely timeline leading to a definitive acquisition
agreement. Both our senior management and BofA Securities also updated our board of directors on a detailed review of Diamond and the strategic and
financial considerations of a transaction, as well as the diligence efforts expended to date and the expected expansion and acceleration of the overall
timeline for completing all diligence. At the special meeting, Mr. Charles R. Corbin, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, reviewed with our board
its fiduciary duties with regard to its evaluation of a possible acquisition transaction involving Diamond.
Starting on December 30, 2020, our senior management and other team members, BofA Securities, and our legal advisors, Alston & Bird LLP
(“Alston & Bird”), Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), and Foley & Lardner LLP (“Foley”), as well as our independent auditor and tax
consultant, Ernst & Young LLP (“E&Y”), were provided access to Diamond’s electronic diligence data room, conducted a substantial amount of diligence,
and engaged in a series of diligence conference calls with representatives from Apollo, Diamond, Credit Suisse, and Apollo’s and Diamond’s outside legal
advisors, including Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”).
Between December 30, 2020 and March 5, 2021, we and our financial, legal, and accounting and tax advisors held over forty separate due diligence
calls with representatives of Apollo, Diamond, and their financial,
 
48
Table of Contents
legal, and accounting and tax advisors lasting up to several hours per call. During these calls, the parties discussed and covered a number of different
areas of Diamond’s business and the Apollo Funds’ ownership in Diamond, including topics pertaining to treasury, inventory and rental activities,
accounting and financial, resort operations and HOAs, sales and marketing, business operations, loan portfolio, IT infrastructure, call center and
marketing, US and foreign tax, labor, employment and human resources, financial accounting, software, legal, consumer licensing and regulatory,
securitization and debt capital, and property and development.
During a portion of the same period, Apollo’s principals, Diamond’s senior management, and their financial, legal and accounting and tax advisors
conducted their own additional business and legal diligence of us and, between January 11, 2021 and February 9, 2021, they and we and our advisors held
several “reverse” due diligence calls regarding our business.
Beginning in late December 2020, our senior management and our outside legal advisors began to prepare a draft merger agreement for the
transaction contemplated by the December 15 proposal. The merger agreement included certain “private company” style adjustments to the purchase
price, including adjustments for working capital, and an indemnification construct, and contemplated that we would purchase representations and
warranties insurance. It also did not contain any type of restriction on our ability to solicit transactions involving an acquisition of HGV. Around the same
time, our senior management and our outside legal advisors began to prepare a draft stockholders agreement, as well as a related overview of key
governance topics (“governance overview”) to be addressed in the stockholders agreement, such as board and governance rights, transfer restrictions,
standstill provisions, non-competition, and consent rights.
On January 6, 2021, BofA Securities, on our behalf, sent to representatives of Credit Suisse a draft governance overview.
On January 9, 2021, we and our legal advisors began to prepare a draft term sheet covering amendments to the existing Hilton license agreement
and other arrangements that our senior management and senior management of Hilton had been discussing with respect to the license fee and related
structure as part of the Diamond integration (such amendments to, or amended and restated, license agreement and other arrangements, the “Hilton
agreements”).
Separately, on January 15, 2021, Simpson Thacher provided a draft of the merger agreement to Paul Weiss. During this time, all parties and their
respective advisors continued to conduct business, legal and financial due diligence of the other party.
On January 20, 2021, Paul Weiss provided a draft governance rights term sheet with respect to the stockholders agreement in response to our
January 6, 2021 governance overview. Among other items, the term sheet addressed board and governance rights, transfer restrictions, preemptive rights,
registration rights, and consent rights, but did not include standstill or noncompetition provisions. All of these topics were the subject of numerous
discussions and negotiations among the parties in the next several weeks.
On January 20, 2021, BofA Securities provided to us a proposal for a $2.3 billion of debt financing commitment for the transaction, which our senior
management began to review and evaluate.
On January 21, 2021, our senior management and senior management of Hilton met in person to discuss and tentatively agreed to the final
economic terms of the previously discussed ramp-up license fee structure for the integration of the Diamond properties.
On January 23, 2021, Paul Weiss provided to us comments to the draft merger agreement. In Paul Weiss’s draft, Apollo proposed a “public
company” style agreement, with no adjustment to the purchase price for working capital, transaction expenses, debt or other liabilities at Diamond unlike
the January 15 draft merger agreement that Simpson Thacher had provided. Also, Paul Weiss’s draft did not include an indemnity construct. These
proposals were the subject of numerous discussions and negotiations among the parties in the coming weeks leading up to the signing of a definitive
agreement.

Table of Contents
Our senior management, BofA Securities and our outside legal advisors engaged in a number of discussions and analysis regarding the key issues
and positions of Apollo and their advisors as reflected in the January 23 comments to the merger agreement. Concurrently, our legal advisors continued
to revise the draft merger agreement and prepare a draft stockholders agreement. During this time, we, our senior management, and our outside advisors
continued to conduct various diligence of Diamond and Apollo.
At the same time, our senior management, together with BofA Securities and PJT Partners, continued to evaluate various debt financing
alternatives and work towards securing necessary debt commitments for the transaction. In furtherance of such effort, on January 26, 2021, our senior
management requested proposals from several financial institutions (Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Truist) for debt financing commitments for the
transaction, to which we received preliminary term sheets and financing strategies from such parties on January 29, 2021. Throughout the rest of January
2021 and February 2021, our senior management held a number of discussions with such financial institutions and BofA Securities to discuss their
respective financial proposals and financing structure.
On February 9, 2021, our senior management, representatives from Apollo and Diamond, Simpson Thacher, Alston & Bird, and Paul Weiss
participated in a telephonic meeting to discuss key issues related to the draft merger agreement and the draft stockholders agreement. Afterwards, Paul
Weiss provided to us, BofA Securities, and our legal advisors a summary of key outstanding issues under both agreements. Over the course of next two
days, we and our advisors discussed those outstanding item and other aspects of the transaction.
On February 10, 2021, our board of directors convened a special meeting with our senior management, BofA Securities, Alston & Bird and Simpson
Thacher in attendance. Mr. Corbin reviewed with our board of directors its fiduciary obligations and the need to maintain strict confidentiality. During the
meeting, our senior management discussed the status of diligence, principal documents, negotiations, governance and Hilton discussions. BofA
Securities overviewed the current state of affairs, financing, timing, and other considerations. Among other items, our senior management and advisors
noted that, while the parties had made substantial progress overall, significant gaps remained on a number of important items in both the merger
agreement and the stockholders agreement, including the “private company” vs. “public company” issue on the merger agreement and, with respect to
the stockholders agreement, the number of board seats, memberships on board committees and related governance matters, transfer restrictions,
expansive consent rights, voting requirements, standstill obligations, and noncompetition restrictions. Our senior management also updated our board of
directors on its evaluation of debt financing alternatives and provided an overview of the preliminary proposals that we had received from the four
financial institutions, and discussed the potential license fee structure for the Diamond business under our license agreement with Hilton, disclosure
implications and potential timing. After consideration, our board of directors instructed management to continue to engage in discussions and
negotiations with Apollo and its advisors to resolve these outstanding items in a manner that appropriately balanced the benefits of pursuing a
transaction against prudence and protecting the company and its stockholders’ interests.
On February 10, 2021, after the special meeting, our senior management and Alston & Bird discussed updates to the draft term sheet for the Hilton
agreements.
On February 11, 2021, our senior management, Alston & Bird and Simpson Thacher held a telephonic conference with Mr. Leonard A. Potter, the
chairman of our board of directors, to discuss the outstanding key items related to the merger agreement, the stockholders agreement, and the timeline.
Shortly after that call, on the same day, Mr. Wang held a telephonic meeting with Mr. Sambur noting that the parties still had some significant gaps
in certain key areas, including excluded liabilities, public company style merger, board and related governance rights, and consent rights over corporate
and board actions. Mr. Wang also noted to Mr. Sambur that, while we were open to continuing to negotiate and discuss such items, it was critical from
our board of directors’ and management’s perspective to continue to focus on our year-end
 
50
Table of Contents
matters, particularly given the number of significant gaps that remained on the parties’ negotiations. Separately, Simpson Thacher had a telephone
conference with Paul Weiss to relay a similar view.
Later on February 11, 2021, Simpson Thacher received an updated issues list for both the merger and stockholders agreements from Paul Weiss on
behalf of Apollo, while Mr. Wang received a similar document from Mr. Sambur, pursuant to which Apollo showed significant progress on a majority of
the outstanding issues.
On February 12, 2021, our senior management met with Alston & Bird and Simpson Thacher to discuss the latest progress from Apollo as reflected
in the revised issues list that Paul Weiss had provided. Given the significant progress made, our legal advisors began to prepare updated drafts of the
merger agreement and stockholders agreement. In addition, Alston & Bird began to prepare drafts of the Hilton agreements and updated the term sheet
related to the Hilton agreements.
On February 19, 2021, Simpson Thacher provided an updated draft of the merger agreement and a draft of the stockholders agreement to Paul
Weiss. The merger agreement included agreed on elements of both a “private company” style agreement (certain excluded liabilities that are not
calculated in the purchase price and certain indemnities) and a “public company’ style agreement (a “locked box” purchase price calculation, where the
purchase price is (a) adjusted downward for any “leakage” that occurs after the locked box date of December 31, 2020 and (b) not adjusted upwards for
any increase in value that occurs after the locked box date). The merger agreement also included interim operating covenants for Diamond customary for
a private company acquisition, limited interim operating covenants for HGV and additional closing conditions related to the warehouse facilities. The
stockholders agreement reflected limited board, committee and related governance rights, significant transfer restrictions, significantly limited Apollo
voting rights, customary standstill provisions, and certain noncompetition obligations.
Between February 22 and February 23, 2021, Paul Weiss provided comments to the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement to Alston &
Bird and Simpson Thacher. The merger agreement reflected closer alignment of the parties on provisions related to indemnification, interim operating
covenants and other covenants. The draft reflected ongoing negotiations on open economic points related to repurchase obligations, financing, taxes
and employees. The draft stockholders agreement also reflected progress that the parties had made on provisions pertaining to board and governance
rights, transfer restrictions, voting rights, standstill provisions, and noncompetition restrictions, but the parties continued to have ongoing negotiations
on some of the details related to those provisions.
On February 23, 2021, Diamond’s board of directors held a meeting with representatives of its management and Paul Weiss in attendance. At that
meeting, representatives of Diamond’s management provided Diamond’s board of directors with a summary of Diamond’s recent financial performance. In
addition, representatives of management updated Diamond’s board of directors on the progress and material economic terms of the potential transaction
with HGV and reviewed with Diamond’s board of directors its fiduciary duties under applicable law in considering such potential transaction. The meeting
concluded with representatives of management indicating that they would continue to keep the board informed of material updates and provide
Diamond’s board of directors with further fulsome details of the material terms of a potential transaction with HGV at a later date.
Starting on February 23, 2021, both parties and their respective advisors commenced a daily status and update call to keep apprised of progress
and any significant outstanding items.
In addition, commencing on February 23, 2021, we and Diamond (including our respective advisors) began to share certain preliminary and
confidential external and internal communication plans in anticipation of a transaction announcement. Ultimately, these included the exchanges of draft
press releases, internal employee and VOI owner communications, and related materials all the way up to the March 10 announcement.
On February 24, 2021, our senior management team met with its advisors, including BofA Securities, Alston & Bird and Simpson Thacher to discuss

stockholders agreement to provide feedback and obtain clarification regarding certain items.
Between February 24, and February 26, 2021, the parties discussed the comments on the merger agreement and stockholders agreement, and
continued dialogue over excluded liabilities and transaction expenses, standstill, and transfer restrictions in the two principal documents. The parties
continued to address gaps in the scope and calculation of excluded liabilities, including transaction expenses of Diamond, change of control payments of
Diamond, taxes, and indebtedness items; antitrust divestiture threshold; termination fees; closing conditions related to warehouse financing and no
securitization defaults; and transfer restrictions and standstill.
On February 25 and February 26, 2021, our senior management and senior management of Hilton discussed comments on the term sheet related to
the Hilton agreements, and their comments on the merger agreement and stockholders agreement, including a request by Hilton to become a party to the
stockholders agreement with a right to consent to any amendment or waiver thereto. The parties also discussed the Hilton consent and the timing of
finalizing such consent and Hilton agreements within the overall timing for finalizing the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement.
On February 26, 2021, Alston & Bird sent a revised draft of the stockholders agreement to Paul Weiss while, on February 27, 2021, Simpson
Thacher sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul Weiss. Over the course of both days, our senior management and Alston & Bird continued
to discuss with Hilton certain open points with respect to the term sheet for the Hilton agreements.
On February 27, 2021, our senior management selected three banks—BofA Securities, Deutsche Bank and Barclays—to provide the necessary debt
financings for the transaction, and the parties, together with their respective counsels, began to prepare and negotiate the debt commitment documents.
Between February 27 and March 1, 2021, HGV, Apollo, Diamond and their respective legal advisors continued to conduct diligence and hold a
number of calls to discuss key open issues on the principal documents. In addition, our senior management, Alston & Bird and Hilton continued to
discuss the Hilton term sheet and Hilton’s comments to the stockholders agreement.
On February 28, 2021, we provided our initial draft of the disclosure schedules to Paul Weiss. We received initial comments on March 2, 2021 and
Apollo, Diamond and their advisors continued to review and provide comments to us, and we continued to revise the disclosure schedules over the
course of next approximately two weeks. During this time, we also reviewed and provide comments on multiple drafts of Diamond’s disclosure schedules.
On March 2, 2021, each of the three standing committees of our board of directors met for its respective regularly scheduled meeting. On March 2,

Apollo designees to serve on the board of directors, and the committee’s evaluation process with respect to such designees.
On March 3, 2021, our board of directors held a meeting with representatives of our management, BofA Securities, Alston & Bird and Simpson

calculation of purchase price items, closing conditions related to Diamond’s warehouse facilities scheduled to roll over, covenants regarding HGV’s proxy
statement and stockholder vote, indemnification for certain pre-closing taxes, the outside date to close the transaction, and the termination fee payable by
HGV in the event that, among other situations, we or Diamond were to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances. BofA Securities
presented to our board of directors its preliminary financial analyses of the merger consideration. Our board of directors also discussed certain
management projections and forecasts for HGV and forecasts relating to anticipated synergies, and directed BofA Securities to use these management

continued to request that it be added as a party to the stockholders agreement for the purposes of approving any amendments or waivers thereto, but we

Thacher in attendance. At that meeting, our management and our advisors in attendance updated the board of directors on the status of negotiations
with Apollo, Diamond and their advisors. BofA Securities made a presentation to our board of directors regarding the business, financial and other
aspects of the potential business combination with Diamond and the outcome of management’s due diligence review of Diamond. Representatives of
BofA Securities then rendered its oral fairness opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion from BofA Securities, dated
March 9, 2021, to our board of directors to the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion and based upon and subject to the various assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by BofA Securities in preparing its written
opinion, as set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by HGV in the proposed acquisition of Diamond pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to HGV (see “—Opinion of our Financial Advisor” on page 60 of this proxy statement). Representatives
of Simpson Thacher reviewed with our board of directors its fiduciary duties under applicable law and reviewed with our board of directors the negotiated
terms of the merger agreement that was substantially complete, focusing on certain changes to the terms discussed at the meeting of our board of
directors on March 3, 2021, such as the agreed on concept that would allow HGV’s board to change its recommendation in favor of the deal in response
to an “Intervening Event” that occurs post-signing of the merger agreement and the calculation of transaction expenses. In addition, Alston & Bird
reviewed with our board of directors the negotiated terms of the stockholders agreement that was substantially complete, focusing on a few items that
remained subject to continuing discussions with Paul Weiss, as well as the substantially completed Hilton agreements. In addition, our management
updated our board of directors that the committed financing package from BofA Securities, Deutsche Bank and Barclays was close to being finalized.
After such review and following further discussion with representatives of BofA Securities, Alston & Bird, and Simpson Thacher about potential
reasons for and against the proposed merger (see below under the heading “ —Our Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Our Board of Directors”
on page 56 of this proxy statement), our board of directors approved the proposed merger and the share issuance substantially on the terms presented to,
and discussed by, the board of directors at the meeting and at the March 3 meeting, as well as the committed financing package, and authorized our
management and our advisors to continue to negotiate and finalize the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders agreement, the Hilton consent,
the Hilton agreements, debt financing documents, and to execute and deliver the merger agreement, substantially in the form provided to the board of
directors in advance of the meeting, with such changes as the authorized officers deemed necessary, desirable or advisable, as well as any ancillary
agreements or items to be provided in connection with the signing of the merger agreement. In approving the debt financing arrangement with BofA
Securities, Deutsche Bank and Barclays, including in connection with considering such arrangement at prior
 
54
Table of Contents
meetings, our board of directors was aware of BofA Securities’ role as our financial advisor in the merger, BofA Securities affiliates’ prior and existing
banking relationship with HGV, and its participation in the debt financing arrangements for the merger transaction.
On March 8, 2021, Diamond’s board of directors held a meeting with representatives of its management and Paul Weiss in attendance. At that
meeting, representatives of Paul Weiss updated Diamond’s board of directors on the status of negotiations with HGV and its advisors and
representatives of Credit Suisse provided an overview to Diamond’s board of directors of the transaction and economic terms. Representatives of Paul
Weiss reviewed with Diamond’s board of directors its fiduciary duties under applicable law in considering a potential transaction with HGV and the
negotiated terms of the merger agreement that was substantially complete and the limited number of open items that remained subject to continuing
discussions with HGV’s advisors, particularly as it related to the calculation of transaction expenses, indebtedness and leakage and other dollar amounts
to be borne by each party. The meeting concluded with representatives of Paul Weiss indicating that they would update Diamond’s board of directors
upon finalization of the open items for their final approval.
Throughout March 8 and March 9, 2021, representatives of HGV, Simpson Thacher, Apollo, Diamond, and Paul Weiss continued to finalize the
terms of the merger agreement, including the dollar amount of the termination fees payable in certain situations by us to Diamond and the interim
operating covenants of Diamond and HGV. In addition, representatives of HGV, Alston & Bird, Paul Weiss, Hilton and Wilmer continued to finalize the
terms of the stockholders agreement, Hilton consent and the Hilton agreements.
On March 9 and early March 10, 2021, we and BofA Securities, Deutsche Bank and Barclays finalized and entered into commitment arrangements
for such banks to provide to us an aggregate of $2.8 billion of debt financing to financing the acquisition of Diamond and the related transactions. In
addition, HGV, Apollo, Diamond, Simpson Thacher and Paul, Weiss finalized the terms of the merger agreement while HGV, Apollo, Alston & Bird, and
Paul Weiss finalized the form of the stockholders agreements, other ancillary documents, and the Hilton consent. Further, contemporaneously, HGV,
Alston & Bird, Hilton and Wilmer finalized the Hilton consent and the Hilton agreements.
During the early morning on March 10, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss provided Diamond’s board of directors with an update on the status of
the discussions with HGV’s advisors and a summary of the material changes to the merger agreement since Diamond’s board of directors last convened.
Diamond’s board of directors proceeded to approve the merger agreement and each of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, by
unanimous written consent.
Later in the early morning of March 10, 2021, we, HGV Borrower, Diamond, the Apollo Investors, and the other Diamond stockholders executed and
delivered the merger agreement. Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, Hilton delivered to us the Hilton consent, and we and Hilton
entered into the Hilton agreements.
On the morning of March 10, 2021, prior to the opening of trading on the NYSE, we, Diamond and Apollo issued a joint press release announcing
the execution of the merger agreement.
Subsequent to the announcement, on April 8, 2021, we determined that the Net Synergy/Cost Savings (as defined below under “—Opinion of Our
Financial Advisor” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement) estimates should have assumed only the synergies that would be achieved subsequent
to the anticipated closing of the transaction of July 1, 2021, rather than a January 1, 2021 closing that was assumed in the initial Net Synergy/Cost
Savings estimates used by BofA Securities in connection with its fairness opinion on March 9, 2021. This adjustment changed our estimate of the realized
Net Synergies/Cost Savings for calendar year 2021 to $25 million from the prior $59 million assumed in the initial fairness opinion. Consequently, (i) BofA
Securities’ discounted cash flow analysis using the original Net Synergy/Cost Savings estimates, as described below under “—Opinion of Our Financial
Advisor” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement, resulted in a range of
 
55
Table of Contents
implied equity value for Diamond of $1,260 million to $1,950 million instead of $1,230 million to $1,930 million, and (ii) BofA Securities’ pro forma relative
ownership analysis based on discounted cash flow using the original Net Synergy/Cost Savings estimates, as described below under “—Opinion of Our
Financial Advisor” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement, resulted in a range of pro forma ownership by Diamond’s stockholder of the combined
company of 22.2% to 38.6% instead of 21.8% to 38.4%. On April 9, 2021, BofA Securities confirmed to our board of directors in writing that had BofA
Securities issued its opinion on the basis of the actual Net Synergies/Cost Savings, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in its
March 9, 2021 opinion.",51,64
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Our Board of Directors,"Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
After careful consideration, our board of directors, at a meeting held on March 8, 2021, unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the
issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable
and in the best interests of HGV and its stockholders. As such, our board of directors authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance of
shares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby by a unanimous vote of its directors, and adopted resolutions
directing that the stock issuance proposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration. Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously
recommends that HGV stockholders vote “FOR” the stock issuance proposal.
HGV’s board of directors considered many reasons in making its decision to approve the merger agreement and the issuance of shares of our
common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and in making its recommendation to the HGV stockholders that they
approve the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger. In arriving at its decision, our board of directors consulted with our senior
management, legal advisors, financial advisors and other advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information, and concluded in its business judgment
that the proposed merger is likely to result in significant strategic and financial benefits to HGV and its stockholders, including the following anticipated
benefits (which are not exclusive or listed in any relative order of importance):
Potentially Positive Considerations
 
 
•
 Combining HGV and Diamond would create a leading vacation ownership company with locations in key destinations and create a more
globally diversified company, with increased scale, geographic presence, diversity of revenue streams and product offerings, particularly as
the travel and leisure industry continues its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic;
 
 
•
 HGV and Diamond have historically focused on different customer pools, and acquiring Diamond will allow HGV to dramatically expand its
potential customer base;
 
 
•
 The expectation that HGV would achieve a minimum of $125 million of targeted annual cost synergies by leveraging operational and general
and administrative cost efficiencies;
 
 
•
 The expectation that the merger will increase recurring EBITDA streams and drive overall cash flow, with adjusted free cash flow per share
accretion in year one (excluding one-time transaction-related expenses);
 
 
•
 The expectation that adding a new brand within HGV as part of the Diamond integration represents a strong strategic fit in conjunction with
Hilton generated opportunities and enhances our ability to capitalize on leads and tours sourced from Hilton;
 
 
•
 The expectation that adding the Hilton Vacations Club Brand to the Diamond portfolio of resorts will add significant credibility and enhance
the value of the Diamond portfolio and existing owners within the existing Diamond business;
 
56Table of Contents
 
•
 The expectation that the merger will accelerate the launch of a HGV-branded trust product offering by rebranding Diamond’s trust, Club, and
properties to drive further revenue growth in a new customer segment
 
 
•
 The expectation that the free cash flow from the combined businesses after the merger would be strong and allow for us to advance further
growth prospects, enhance stockholder returns and/or repay debt;
 
 
•
 The expectation of sales growth with respect to Diamond’s vacation ownership business and properties, and potential for further
improvement when combined with opportunities provided by our agreements with Hilton;
 
 
•
 The fact that Hilton has provided its irrevocable consent as required under the Hilton license agreement (subject to certain limited
conditions), and we and Hilton have entered into the A&R license agreement and other arrangements that will facilitate our integration of
Diamond’s business and properties, as more fully described in “Other Agreements—Hilton Agreements and Consent” beginning on page
109 of this proxy statement;
 
 
•
 The fact that because the number of shares of our common stock to be issued under the merger agreement is fixed (with certain
adjustments) and will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the market price of shares of our common stock, we have greater certainty as to the
number of shares of our common stock to be issued in the merger;
 
 
•
 Based on our outstanding shares as of June 1, 2021, our stockholders would own approximately 72% of the combined company on a fully
diluted basis immediately following the closing of the merger and, therefore, will continue to participate in potential appreciation in equity
value of the combined company;
 
 
•
 The continuity of our board of directors and their familiarity with, and understanding of, our company and the timeshare industry, as
augmented by the expected addition of two members designated by Apollo, which will only add to our board of directors’ understanding
and knowledge of Diamond and add additional experience with the timeshare industry;
 
 
•
 The oral opinion of BofA Securities to our board of directors on March 8, 2021, and the written opinion of BofA Securities to our board of
directors, dated March 9, 2021, and related financial analysis presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors on such dates, to the
effect that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the
merger consideration in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to us. A copy of that written opinion is included as
Annex B to this proxy statement and described under “—Opinion of our Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement;
 
 
•
 The belief of our board of directors, following consultation with our senior management, and based in part upon the debt financing
commitments that we obtained, that it was likely that we would be able to obtain the necessary financing to refinance our debt and existing
Diamond indebtedness, if necessary, and that after the completion of the merger, HGV would be able to repay and service any indebtedness
that is expected to form the interim or permanent financing of the merger and, with respect to such indebtedness, to comply with the
financial covenants applicable to such indebtedness, after its review and discussion of various factors, including the expected terms of the
proposed interim and permanent financing for the merger (including fees and interest);
 
 
•
 The fact that Diamond’s remedy in the event we are not able to obtain the proceeds of our committed debt financing in connection with the
merger could be limited to a reverse termination fee of $73.5 million;
 
 
•
 The terms and conditions of the merger agreement reflect our and Diamond’s commitment to closing;
 
 
•
 The ability of our board of directors, under certain circumstances, to make a change in their recommendation of the merger agreement in
response to certain intervening events favorable to us;
 
57
Table of Contents
 
•
 The fact that the merger is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the shares of HGV common stock, and that stockholders have
the ability to reject the merger;
 
 
•
 We purchased a representation and warranty insurance policy in connection with Diamond’s representations and warranties in the merger
agreement and obtained certain indemnities from the Apollo Investors, which protects us against certain downside risk;
 
 
•
 The terms of the transaction were heavily negotiated over the course of a long period of discussions with an Apollo affiliate, and the Apollo
affiliate agreed to price and post-closing recourse terms that our board of directors thought were attractive;
 
 
•
 The fact that Apollo is a sophisticated investor and Apollo’s willingness to have the Apollo Funds invest in the combined company by
taking stock consideration, which our board of directors viewed as validation of the combined company’s prospects;
 
 
•
 Apollo agreed to certain company favorable governance terms under the stockholders agreement, including (a) limited approval rights and
(b) a standstill and our ability to adopt a poison pill that would prevent the Apollo Funds from acquiring control of the combined company
without negotiating with the full board of directors of the combined company;
 
 
•
 Our ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the merger agreement, to engage in discussions with a third party that was interested
in acquiring HGV or the combined company;
 
 
•
 Apollo agreed to certain restrictions in the stockholders agreement on the manner and timing of the Apollo Funds’ ability to exit HGV stock,
and such restrictions could be favorable to our stockholders; and
 
 
•
 The merger agreement includes a condition that we will not be obligated to close the merger if a material adverse effect on Diamond has
occurred and is continuing.
Potentially Negative Considerations
In the course of its deliberations, our board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative
considerations relevant to the transaction, including the following (which are not exclusive or listed in any relative order of importance):
 
 
•
 The restrictions on the conduct of our business during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the completion of the
merger;
 
 
•
 The costs associated with completing the merger and realizing the benefits we expect to obtain in connection with the merger, including
management’s time and energy and potential opportunity cost;
 
 
•
 The challenges in absorbing the effect of any failure to complete the merger, including potential termination fees and stockholder and market
reactions;
 
 
•
 The potential earnings dilution to our stockholders following the closing of the merger if synergies are not achieved;
 
 
•
 Our stockholders, who currently own all of the equity interests in HGV, will own approximately 72% of the equity interest in the combined
company on a fully diluted basis (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021);
 
 
•
 The challenges inherent in combining two businesses of the size and complexity of HGV and Diamond, including the possible diversion of
management and employee attention for an extended period of time;
 
 
•
 The potential for diversion of management and employee attention during the period before completion of the merger, and the potential
negative effects on our and our combined company’s business;
 
58
Table of Contents
 
•
 The extent to which our increased leverage could result in restrictions on our uses of cash, which could cause us to reduce capital
expenditures, limit financing offered to customers (which could result in reduced sales) and dedicate an unsustainable level of its cash flow
from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness;
 
 
•
 The risk that certain provisions in certain of our and Diamond’s contracts may constrain or delay the timing for realizing, operational and
development plans, synergies, cost savings and other anticipated benefits expected to result from a combination of us and Diamond;
 
 
•
 The risk that regulatory agencies may object to and challenge the merger or may impose terms and conditions in order to resolve those
objections that adversely affect our financial results on a combined basis; see the section entitled “—Regulatory Clearances Required for
the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement;
 
 
•
 Hilton’s right to terminate or take other actions with respect to the A&R license agreement with us following the consummation of the
merger if we fail to comply with its terms as we integrate the Diamond business;
 
 
•
 Hilton’s ability to revoke its consent of the merger in the event that the merger agreement is materially amended or the final form of the
stockholders agreement is modified between the date of the merger agreement and the closing;
 
 
•
 The absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement and Diamond’s ability to terminate the agreement and seek payment of a
termination fee in the event we are not able to obtain the proceeds of our committed debt financing in connection with the merger;
 
 
•
 The potential that the fixed exchange ratio under the merger agreement could result in us delivering greater value to Diamond stockholders
than had been anticipated by HGV should the value of the shares of our common stock increase from the date of the execution of the merger
agreement;
 
 
•
 The risk that the travel and leisure industry will not recover as quickly or as much as we expect or would hope from the COVID-19 pandemic,
or that the pandemic will continue to cause significant disruptions and adverse effect on our business, Diamond’s business, the travel and
leisure industry, and the global economy in general, making it very difficult for us to achieve positive benefits from the merger;
 
 
•
 The risk of significant decline in value of Diamond’s business during the period between signing and closing;
 
 
•
 The risk that the Apollo Funds exit the stock of the combined company which could drive down the share price of the stock of the
combined company;
 
 
•
 The risk that adding two members to the board of directors of the combined company could alter the dynamics of the board of directors in
unproductive ways;
 
 
•
 The risk that Diamond employees may not successfully integrate into our culture;
 
 
•
 The risk that our existing customers may not accept or use the Diamond properties as part of our overall network of properties after the
integration;
 
 
•
 The risk that an Apollo affiliate may end up competing with the combined company through other investments;
 
 
•
 The risk that our stockholders will be diluted in the short term before expected synergies are achieved; and
 
 
•
 Acquirors often face a decline in their stock price immediately post-announcement.
Further, our board of directors considered that some members of our board of directors and certain executive officers may have interests in the
proposed merger as individuals that are in addition to, and that may
 
59
Table of Contents
be different from, the interest of our stockholders generally, as described under “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement.
After considering the factors described above, our board of directors unanimously concluded that the potentially positive reasons relating to the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of shares of our common stock to Diamond stockholders,
outweighed the potentially negative reasons.
The foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by our board of directors is not exhaustive but is intended to reflect the
material reasons considered by our board of directors in its evaluation of the merger. In view of the complexity, and the large number, of the reasons
considered, our board of directors, both individually and collectively, did not find it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or assign any relative
or specific weight to the various reasons. Rather, our board of directors based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and
considered by it. In addition, individual members of our board of directors may have given different weight to different reasons.
The foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by our board of directors is forward-looking in nature. This information
should be read in light of the reasons described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 22 of this proxy statement and “Special Note About Forward-
Looking Statements” beginning on page 36 of this proxy statement.
Opinion of Our Financial Advisor
HGV has retained BofA Securities to act as HGV’s financial advisor in connection with the merger. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. As
previously noted, HGV selected BofA Securities to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Securities’ experience in
transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community, and its familiarity with HGV, Diamond, and their respective businesses, and
its significant hospitality, gaming and real estate M&A and capital markets experience.
On March 8, 2021, at a meeting of HGV’s board of directors held to evaluate the merger, BofA Securities delivered to HGV’s board of directors an
oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 9, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to
various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to HGV.
On April 8, 2021, HGV notified BofA Securities that the Net Synergies/Cost Savings (as defined below) used by BofA Securities in connection with
its fairness opinion should have assumed only the synergies that would be achieved subsequent to the anticipated closing of the transaction of July 1,
2021, rather than a January 1, 2021 closing. Specifically, the estimated cost savings for fiscal year 2021 should have been stated as $25 million rather than
$59 million as reflected in the Net Synergies/Cost Savings. Consequently, (i) BofA Securities’ discounted cash flow analysis using the original Net
Synergy/Cost Savings estimates, as described below, resulted in a range of implied equity value for Diamond of $1,260 million to $1,950 million instead of
$1,230 million to $1,930 million, and (ii) BofA Securities’ pro forma relative ownership analysis based on discounted cash flow using the original Net
Synergy/Cost Savings estimates, as described below, resulted in a range of pro forma ownership by Diamond’s shareholders of the combined company of
22.2% to 38.6% instead of 21.8% to 38.4%. On April 9, 2021, BofA Securities confirmed in writing to HGV’s board of directors that had BofA Securities
issued its opinion on the basis of the actual Net Synergies/Cost Savings, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in such opinion.
The full text of the written opinion of BofA Securities to the HGV board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
 
60
Table of Contents
qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the written opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to the HGV board of directors for the benefit and use of the HGV
board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration provided for in the merger
from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger and no opinion or view
was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to HGV or any of its
affiliates or in which HGV or any of its affiliates might engage or as to the underlying business decision of HGV to proceed with or effect the merger.
BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
as to how to vote or act in connection with the stock issuance proposal or any related matter.

forma basis;
 
 
(m)
reviewed a draft, dated March 7, 2021, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
 
 
(n)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and BofA Securities
relied upon the assurances of the managements of HGV and Diamond that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Diamond Forecasts, BofA Securities were advised by Diamond,
and BofA Securities assumed with the consent of HGV, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best available estimates and good faith
judgments of the management of Diamond as to the future financial performance of Diamond. With respect to the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts, the HGV
Forecasts and the Net Synergies/Cost Savings, BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of HGV, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of HGV as to the future financial performance of Diamond and HGV and the
other matters covered thereby and, based on the assessments of the management of HGV as to the relative likelihood of achieving the future financial
results reflected in the Diamond Forecasts and the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts, BofA Securities relied, at the direction of HGV, on the Adjusted
Diamond Forecasts for purposes of its opinion. BofA Securities relied, at the direction of HGV, on the assessments of the management of HGV as to
HGV’s ability to achieve the Net Synergies/Cost Savings and were advised by HGV, and assumed, that the Net Synergies/Cost Savings will be realized in
the amounts and at the times projected. BofA Securities did not make, nor were they provided with, any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets
or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Diamond or HGV, nor did BofA Securities make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Diamond or
HGV. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Diamond or HGV under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of HGV, that the merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without
waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture
requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Diamond, HGV or the contemplated benefits of the
merger. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of HGV, that the merger will qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of HGV, that the final
executed merger agreement did not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other than the merger consideration to
the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any adjustments to the merger
consideration, or any terms, aspects or implications of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to
the merger or otherwise. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to HGV of the merger consideration provided
for in the merger and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the merger by the holders of any
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or
class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in
comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to HGV or in which HGV might engage or as to the underlying business decision of
HGV to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Securities also did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and BofA Securities relied, at the
direction of HGV, upon the
 
62
Table of Contents
assessments of representatives of HGV regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Diamond, HGV or the merger, as to
which matters BofA Securities understood that HGV obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. BofA Securities did not
express any opinion as to what the value of our common stock actually will be when issued or the prices at which our common stock will trade at any
time, including following announcement or consummation of the merger. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how
any holder of shares of our common stock should vote or act in connection with the stock issuance proposal or any related matter.
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on,
and the information made available to BofA Securities as of, the date of its opinion. BofA Securities noted that the credit, financial and stock markets have
been experiencing unusual volatility and BofA Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on HGV, Diamond, or
the merger. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities.
The discussions set forth below in the sections entitled “—Summary of Material Diamond Financial Analyses,” “—Summary of Material HGV
Financial Analyses” and “—Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses” represent a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by
BofA Securities to HGV’s board of directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set
forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.
Summary of Material Diamond Financial Analyses
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for Diamond and
four publicly traded companies in the timeshare industry. BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded
companies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on March 5, 2021, plus debt, plus preferred stock, plus minority interest, and less
cash and cash equivalents, as a multiple of calendar year 2019 and estimated calendar year 2022 (which years were selected by BofA Securities in an effort
to analyze financial characteristics of Diamond unaffected by COVID-19) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, unburdened for
net construction deferrals, non-operating gains, share-based compensation expenses and one-time, non-recurring expenses including impairment
expenses, which is consistent with the management of HGV’s methodology and which is referred to herein as Adj. EBITDA. The mean and median
enterprise value / calendar year 2019 Adj. EBITDA multiple observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 9.4x and 9.0x, respectively, and the
mean and median enterprise value / estimated calendar year 2022 Adj. EBITDA multiple for the selected publicly traded companies were 9.5x and 9.2x,
respectively. The selected publicly traded companies and their respective multiples are as follows:

The overall low to high calendar year 2019 and 2022 Adj. EBITDA multiples observed for selected publicly traded companies were 6.6x to 13.1x
(with an average of 9.4x and a median of 9.0x) and 8.2x to 11.2x (with an average of 9.5x and a median of 9.2x), respectively. Estimated financial data of the
selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated financial data of Diamond were based on
the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts.
Based on the financial characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies and Diamond, and based on its professional judgment and
experience, BofA Securities applied calendar year 2019 and 2022 Adj. EBITDA multiples of 6.5x to 8.0x, derived from the selected publicly traded
companies, to Diamond’s calendar year 2019 and 2022 estimated Adj. EBITDA of $304 million and $324 million, respectively, as set forth in the Adjusted
Diamond Forecasts, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values for Diamond. BofA Securities then calculated implied base equity value reference
ranges by deducting estimated net debt of Diamond of $1,622 million as of December 31, 2020, as provided by Diamond’s management, from such equity
values. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges for Diamond inclusive of estimated synergies by adding to each of the base
equity value reference ranges the product of assumed annual net synergies of $120 million (the “Run-Rate Synergies”), based on the Net Synergies/Cost
Savings, and the same multiple ranges of 6.5x to 8.0x.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied base equity value ranges and equity value ranges inclusive of synergies for Diamond, as
compared to the equity value of Diamond implied by the merger consideration, calculated based on HGV’s closing stock price as of March 5, 2021:

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Diamond. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Diamond was compared.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to eight selected
transactions involving companies in the timeshare industry. BofA Securities reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for
the target company based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s estimated Adj.
EBITDA/revenue. The selected transactions and their respective multiples are as follows:

The overall low to high multiples of enterprise value to the target companies’ Adj. EBITDA for the selected transactions were 6.0x to 14.8x (with a
median of 9.7x). Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information. Estimated financial data of Diamond
were based on the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts.
BofA Securities then applied enterprise value/Adj. EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 13.0x, derived from the selected transactions and based on its
professional experience and judgment, to Diamond’s calendar year 2019 and estimated calendar year 2022 (which years were selected by BofA Securities
in an effort to analyze financial characteristics of Diamond unaffected by COVID-19) Adj. EBITDA, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values for
Diamond. BofA Securities then calculated implied base equity value reference ranges by deducting estimated net debt of Diamond of $1,622 million as of
December 31, 2020, as provided by Diamond’s management, from such equity values. In applying the calendar year 2019 and 2022 multiples, BofA
Securities took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for Diamond, the common
stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of Diamond and the selected publicly traded companies.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value ranges for Diamond, as compared to the implied equity value of Diamond by
the merger consideration, calculated based on HGV’s closing stock price as of March 5, 2021:

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Diamond or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation
of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or
transactions to which Diamond and the merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Diamond to calculate the estimated present value
of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Diamond was forecasted to generate during calendar years 2021 through 2025 based on the
Adjusted Diamond Forecasts. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for Diamond by applying terminal forward multiples of 6.0x to 7.5x to Diamond’s
calendar year 2026 estimated Adj. EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of March 5, 2021 using discount
rates ranging from 9.50% to 11.50%, which were based on an estimate of Diamond’s weighted average cost of capital. From the resulting enterprise values,
BofA Securities deducted estimated net debt of Diamond as of December 31, 2020 of $1,622 million, as provided by Diamond’s management, to derive
implied base equity value reference ranges.
BofA Securities then calculated the unlevered, after tax free cash flows projected to result from the net cost savings and revenue synergies for
calendar years 2021 through 2025 based on the Net Synergies/Cost Savings, as well as terminal values for such net cost savings and revenue synergies
by applying terminal forward multiples of 6.0x to 7.5x to calendar year 2026 estimated net cost savings and revenue synergies based on the Net
Synergies/Cost Savings. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of March 5, 2021 using discount rates ranging
from 9.50% to 11.50%, which were based on an estimate of Diamond’s weighted average cost of capital to arrive at an estimated present value of such net
cost savings and revenue synergies.

Summary of Material HGV Financial Analyses
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for HGV and
three publicly traded companies in the timeshare industry. BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded
companies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on March 5, 2021, plus debt, plus preferred stock, plus minority interest, and less
cash and cash equivalents, as a multiple of calendar year 2019 and estimated calendar year 2022 (which years were selected by BofA Securities in an effort
to analyze financial characteristics of HGV unaffected by COVID-19) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, unburdened for net
construction deferrals, non-operating gains, share-based compensation expenses and one-time, non-recurring expenses including impairment expenses,
calculated in accordance with a methodology prescribed by HGV’s management, which is referred to herein as Adj. EBITDA. The mean and median
enterprise value / calendar year 2019 Adj. EBITDA multiple observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 9.4x and 9.0x, respectively, and the
mean and median enterprise value / estimated calendar year 2022 Adj. EBITDA multiple for the selected publicly traded companies were 9.5x and 9.2x,
respectively. The selected publicly traded companies and their respective multiples are as follows:

The overall low to high calendar year 2019 and 2022 Adj. EBITDA multiples observed for selected publicly traded companies were 6.6x to 13.1x
(with an average of 9.4x and a median of 9.0x) and 8.2x to 11.2x (with an average of 9.5x and a median of 9.2x), respectively. Estimated financial data of the
selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates and estimated financial data of HGV were based on the
HGV Forecasts.
Based on the financial characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies and HGV, and based on its professional judgment and experience,
BofA Securities applied calendar year 2019 and 2022 Adj. EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x, derived from the selected publicly traded companies to HGV’s
calendar year 2019 and 2022 estimated Adj. EBITDA of $453 million and $469 million, respectively, as set forth in the HGV Forecasts, to calculate ranges of
implied enterprise values per share of our common stock. BofA Securities then calculated implied per share of our common stock equity value reference
ranges by deducting estimated net debt of HGV of $737 million as of December 31, 2020, as provided by HGV’s management, from such equity values, and
dividing the result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information provided by HGV
management.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of HGV to calculate the estimated present value of the
standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that HGV was forecasted to generate during calendar years 2021 through 2025 based on the HGV
Forecasts. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for HGV by applying terminal forward multiples of 6.5x to 8.5x to HGV’s calendar year 2026 estimated
Adj. EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of March 5, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.50% to
10.50%, which were based on an estimate of HGV’s weighted average cost of capital. From the resulting enterprise values, BofA Securities deducted
estimated net debt of HGV as of December 31, 2020 of $737 million, as provided by HGV’s management, from such enterprise values and dividing the
result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information provided by HGV’s
management.

Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses
Using the results of the analyses described above under “Summary of Material Diamond Financial Analyses—Selected Publicly Traded Companies
Analysis”, “Summary of Material Diamond Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”, “Summary of Material HGV Financial Analyses—
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis”, and “Summary of Material HGV Financial Analyses— Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”, BofA Securities
determined Diamond’s implied relative pro forma ownership percentage of the combined company. In order to calculate the implied relative pro forma
ownership, BofA Securities used (i) implied equity value ranges inclusive of synergies for Diamond and the implied aggregate common stock equity value
reference ranges for HGV, in each case obtained pursuant to the selected publicly traded companies analysis using 2019 Adj. EBITDA and 2022 estimated
Adj. EBITDA and rounded to the nearest $10 million, and (ii) the implied equity value range inclusive of synergies for Diamond and the implied aggregate
common stock equity value reference range for HGV, in each case obtained pursuant to the discounted cash flow analysis and rounded to the nearest
$10 million. BofA Securities then compared Diamond’s implied relative pro forma ownership percentages of the combined company resulting from these
analyses with Diamond’s relative pro forma ownership percentage of the combined company implied by the merger consideration, as follows:

Other Factors
In rendering its opinion, BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ material financial
analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
 
 
(1)
historical trading prices and trading volumes of our common stock during the period from January 1, 2019 until March 5, 2021 (the
“Reference Period”);
 
 
(2)
an illustrative has/gets analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for HGV stockholders resulting from the merger based on a
comparison of (i) the pro forma ownership by HGV stockholders of the combined company following the merger, and (ii) the 100%
ownership by HGV stockholders of our common stock on a stand-alone basis, using the discounted cash flow analyses described above in
“—Summary of Material Diamond Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” And “—Summary of Material HGV Financial
Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”, which indicated that the value attributable to a share of our common stock on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the merger would generally be higher than that on a stand-alone basis based on such analyses; and
 
 
(3)
the potential pro forma financial effect of the merger on HGV’s estimated adjusted free cash flow per share from 2021 through 2023, which
indicated that the merger could be accretive to HGV’s adjusted free cash flow per share in each of calendar years 2021 through 2023.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the sections entitled “—Summary of Material Diamond Financial Analyses,” “—Summary of
Material HGV Financial Analyses”, and “—Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses” represent a brief summary of the material financial analyses
presented by BofA Securities to HGV’s board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses
undertaken by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses
summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been
referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of HGV and Diamond. The estimates of the future performance of HGV and Diamond in or underlying BofA Securities’
analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or
those suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to HGV’s board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have
traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis
described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual values of HGV or
Diamond.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between HGV and Diamond, rather than by any
financial advisor, and was approved by HGV’s board of directors. The
 
68
Table of Contents
decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of HGV’s board of directors. As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were
only one of many factors considered by HGV’s board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of
the views of HGV’s board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.
HGV has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of up to $35 million, of which (a) $1.5 million
was payable in connection with its opinion, and (b) $31.0 million base fee and up to $2.5 million discretionary fee are contingent upon the completion of
the merger. HGV also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify
BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against
specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives
trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset
and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of
customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity,
debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of HGV, Diamond and certain of their respective
affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial
banking and other financial services to HGV and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including
(i) having acted or acting as joint lead manager in certain asset-backed securitization transactions and as administrative agent, managing agent and/or as
a joint bookrunner for, and as a lender (including in some cases as a swing-line lender and a letter of credit lender) to, HGV and/or its affiliates, and
(ii) having provided or providing certain derivatives and foreign exchange trading and treasury management services and products to HGV and/or its
affiliates. From February 1, 2019 through January 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from HGV and its affiliates of
approximately $22 million.
As described below under “—Description of Debt Financing”, BofA Securities and its affiliate Bank of America, N.A., together with a group of
other banks and lending institutions, entered into a commitment letter with HGV with respect to certain financing arrangements in connection with the
merger. Pursuant to such commitment letter, BofA Securities will act as a global coordinator and bookrunner with respect to the term loan and bridge loan
facilities and Bank of America, N.A. will act as sole administrative agent with respect to the term loan facility. In addition, Bank of America, N.A. acted as
bookrunner with respect to certain amendments to the Company’s existing facility in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and made “back-stop” financing commitments in respect thereof. In connection with such commitment letter, BofA Securities, together with a
group of other securities firms, also entered into an engagement letter with an affiliate of HGV pursuant to which BofA Securities would act as
underwriter, initial purchaser, placement agent, bookrunner and/or billing and delivery agent with respect to the underwritten offering or private placement
of debt securities to be issued in connection with the merger. BofA Securities and Bank of America, N.A. will be entitled to receive fees in an aggregate
amount estimated to be up to $9.5 million in connection with the aforementioned financing arrangements.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to Diamond and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these
services, including having provided or providing certain derivatives and foreign exchange trading and treasury management services and products to

Table of Contents
Diamond and/or its affiliates. From February 1, 2019 through January 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Diamond
and its affiliates of approximately $2.5 million.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to Apollo, an affiliate of Diamond, and certain of its affiliates and their portfolio companies and have
received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to Apollo
and certain of its affiliates and their portfolio companies in connection with certain M&A transactions, (ii) having acted or acting as administrative agent,
collateral agent, arranger, bookrunner and/or lender for Apollo and certain of its affiliates and their portfolio companies in connection with, among other
things, the financing for various acquisition transactions, (iii) having acted or acting as underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for various
equity and debt offerings undertaken by Apollo and certain of its affiliates and their portfolio companies and (iv) having provided or providing certain
commodity, derivatives and foreign exchange trading services and treasury and trade management services and products to Apollo and certain of its
affiliates and their portfolio companies. From February 1, 2019 through January 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues
from Apollo and its affiliates in excess of $400 million.",64,78

Other than annual and other limited financial guidance provided to investors, which we may update from time to time, we do not, as a matter of
course, publicly disclose long-term forecasts as to future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. However, we have included below certain of our financial forecasts that, as described below, were furnished to
our board of directors, BofA Securities, Diamond and Diamond’s financial advisor, Credit Suisse, in connection with discussions concerning the merger.
During the course of our evaluation of Diamond, we received from Diamond and Credit Suisse similar long-term forecasts of Diamond, including
Diamond’s Adjusted EBITDA, to which we made certain adjustments to be consistent with our forecasting methodology, including our definition of
Adjusted EBITDA. Such adjustments lowered Diamond provided forecasts for all covered years. We refer to such adjusted Diamond forecast in this
proxy statement as the “Adjusted Diamond Forecasts.” Our management provided to our board of directors and our financial advisor the Adjusted
Diamond Forecasts, the HGV Forecasts, the Net Synergies/Cost Savings, and the HGV Combined Company Forecasts.
For internal purposes and in connection with the process leading to the merger agreement, our management prepared certain projections of future
financial performance of HGV on a stand-alone basis for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. We refer to the HGV
forecasts in this proxy statement as the “HGV Forecasts.” The estimates of HGV’s future financial performance set forth below entitled “HGV Forecasts”
were prepared by our management based on management’s reasonable best estimates, judgments and assumptions with respect to HGV’s future financial
performance at the time such estimates were prepared. Our management furnished the HGV Forecasts to our board of directors and BofA Securities,
Diamond and Credit Suisse.
As noted above, we also provided to our board of directors and BofA Securities the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts. The estimates set forth below
entitled “Adjusted Diamond Forecasts” were prepared using forecasts provided by Diamond’s management based on such management’s reasonable
best estimates, judgments and assumptions with respect to its future financial performance at the time such estimates were prepared, as adjusted by our
management to be consistent with our forecasting methodology, including our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. In all affected forecast years, our
management’s adjustments resulted in lower Adjusted Diamond Forecasts as compared to forecasts provided by Diamond.
Our management, after discussions with Diamond, also estimated that the projected realization of (i) annual EBITDA synergies would be
$25.1 million, $117.1 million, $135.7 million, $133.4 million and $119.8 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025,
respectively, and (ii) discrete costs
 
70Table of Contents
would be $25 million, $106.1 million, $104.5 million, $111.7 million and $10.5 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and
2025, respectively, in each case assuming a July 1, 2021 closing date (which we refer to as the “Net Synergies/Cost Savings”). Such synergies are not
reflected in the HGV Forecasts or the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts but they are reflected in the HGV Combined Company Forecasts (as defined below). In
addition, our management prepared certain projections of future financial and operating performance for the combined company for the fiscal years
ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 by combining the HGV Forecasts, the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts and the Net Synergies/Cost
Savings. Such projections are referred to in this proxy statement as the “HGV Combined Company Forecasts.” The HGV Combined Company Forecasts
were provided to our board of directors and BofA Securities.
The HGV Forecasts, the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts, the Net Synergies/Cost Savings and the HGV Combined Company Forecasts are sometimes
referred to as the “HGV Forward Looking Financial Information.”
With our approval, BofA Securities utilized the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information for its financial analysis and for purposes of its opinion
(summarized in the section entitled “—Opinion of Our Financial Advisor” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement). The HGV Forward Looking
Financial Information (i.e., prospective financial information) was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of
our and Diamond’s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis and reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments. In addition, the
HGV Forward Looking Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-
looking statements or GAAP. Instead, such information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments,
and presents, to each of our and Diamond’s respective management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future
financial performance of each of us, Diamond, and us and Diamond on a combined basis for the purposes of evaluating the merger. A summary of this
information is presented below.
The HGV Forward Looking Financial Information covers multiple years and by their nature become less reliable with each successive year. While
the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information was prepared in good faith, no assurance can be made regarding future events. The estimates and
assumptions underlying these financial forecasts involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and
financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic,
competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic
conditions affecting the industries in which we and Diamond operate, and the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” (as well as those
that are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement) and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” all of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are outside our and Diamond’s control and will be beyond the control of the combined company. We urge our stockholders to review
our SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to our business, as well as the section entitled “Risk Factors.” There can be no assurance that
the underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized, and actual results likely will differ, and may differ
materially, from those reflected in the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information, whether or not the merger is completed. The inclusion in this proxy
statement of the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information below should not be regarded as an indication that we, Diamond, our respective boards of
directors or our respective financial advisors considered, or now considers, these forecasts to be necessarily predictive of future results. The HGV
Forward Looking Financial Information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. In addition, both the HGV Forecasts and the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts assume that each of
HGV and Diamond would continue to operate as standalone companies, without giving effect to the merger or other transactions discussed in this proxy
statement and as if the merger and other transactions had not been contemplated by us or Diamond.

The HGV Forward Looking Financial Information includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as
presented in this proxy statement may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by us, Diamond or other companies. The footnotes to the tables
below provide certain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (our
independent registered public accounting firm) nor any other independent registered public accounting firm (including Deloitte & Touche LLP, as
Diamond’s independent auditors) has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information
contained in these financial forecasts and, accordingly, none of Ernst & Young LLP, Deloitte & Touche LLP and any other independent registered public
accounting firm has expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto and no independent registered public accounting
firm assumes any responsibility for the prospective financial information. Neither firm assumes any responsibility for, and each disclaims any association
with, such information. The Ernst & Young LLP and Deloitte & Touche LLP reports incorporated by reference or included in this proxy statement relate to
the historical financial information of HGV and Diamond, respectively. Those reports do not extend to the financial forecasts and should not be read to do
so. The HGV Forward Looking Financial Information forecasts were prepared by HGV solely for use by our board of directors in connection with its
consideration of HGV’s acquisition of Diamond, and BofA Securities in connection with their financial analysis and opinion and, Diamond and Diamond’s
financial advisor in connection with Diamond’s consideration of the merger. Such forecasts are subjective in many respects.
By including in this proxy statement the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information below, none of HGV, Diamond or any of our or their respective
representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of HGV or Diamond compared to the information
contained in the financial forecasts. Further, the inclusion of HGV Forward Looking Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation by us that this information is material. The HGV Forward Looking Financial Information summarized in this section reflected
the best estimates, judgments and assumptions available to our management at the time such information was prepared and have not been updated to
reflect any changes since the dates each was prepared. Neither us nor, after completion of the merger, the combined company undertakes any obligation,
except as required by law, to update or otherwise revise the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing since their
preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error,
or to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions.
HGV Forward Looking Financial Information should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding HGV contained in our filings with the SEC.
The summary of the financial forecasts is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the stock
issuance proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting; it is included because HGV Forward Looking Financial Information
was made available to our board of directors and our financial advisor and, in the case of the HGV Forecasts, to Diamond and Diamond’s financial
advisor.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote “FOR” the stock issuance proposal, you should be aware that certain
members of our board of directors and certain executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be in addition to, or different from, your
interest as our stockholder. These interests may create the appearance of conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these potential
conflicts of interest during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in making its decisions to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the
stock issuance.
Each of the current members of our board of directors and our senior management team will continue as our director or executive officer,
respectively, following the completion of the merger and will hold office from and after the completion of the merger until his or her successor is duly
elected and qualified or until his or her earlier

Table of Contents
death, resignation, retirement or removal, except that, as previously announced, we and our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer have
agreed to separate after the consummation of the merger as part of our planned integration of the Diamond business and synergy in connection with the
merger.
The merger will technically constitute a “change in control” for purposes of our currently outstanding equity-based awards and current executive
severance agreements. However, as our obligations to make or confer any change in control payments, accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements
under such agreements and arrangements are “double-trigger” (i.e., such benefits are triggered only as a result of a qualifying termination within a certain
period of time after a “change in control” event), and, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer as described above,
we do not intend to terminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger, we do not anticipate any change in control payments,
accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to be triggered for our executive officers by the merger. The merger also will constitute a “change in control”
under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, pursuant to which certain of our executive officers have elected to defer salary and/or bonus amounts.
Pursuant to the terms of such plan, we are required to distribute to all plan participants all deferred amounts within thirty (30) days following the closing
of the merger. However, all deferred compensation accounts are fully vested and only comprise those earned amounts that our executive officers have
elected to defer. The merger does not result in any benefit enhancements under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.
Merger-Related Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information
about certain compensation and benefits payable to each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
The compensation shown in this table and described in the footnote to the table is the subject of a non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders
at the special meeting, as described in “Proposal No. 2: Compensation Proposal” beginning on page 152. The compensation reflected in the table below
would be triggered by the merger only if and upon the named executive officer’s “qualifying termination” (as defined below) within certain periods of time
after the consummation of the merger as specified in such table. However, as noted previously, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and
Chief Marketing Officer, for whom we have already disclosed the pending separation, we do not intend to terminate any of our named executive officers in
connection with the merger. Accordingly, we do not expect to make any such payments to our named executive officers other than to our Executive Vice
President and Chief Marketing Officer in connection with her separation, and the information below is provided solely to comply with the applicable
disclosure requirements as noted above. In addition, with respect to the cash severance payments, our named executive officers would be entitled to
such amounts in any event upon a qualifying termination in accordance with the terms of the severance agreements even without the consummation of
the merger. None of the information below represents any additional or enhanced benefits for our named executive officers other than those that already
exist and have been previously disclosed.
The amounts reflected in the table relate to each named executive officer’s existing severance agreement and equity awards, which arrangements
we have previously disclosed in our proxy statement for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. The amounts indicated below are estimates based on
multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below, and do not
reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the effective time of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed
(i) August 1, 2021 as the closing date of the merger: (ii) a termination of each named executive officer’s employment without cause or resignation for good
reason, effective as of immediately following the effective time of the merger; and (iii) a price per share of our common stock of $40.14 (the average closing
market price of our common stock over the first 5 business days following the public announcement of the merger on March 10, 2021).

Reflects double-trigger severance benefits that would become payable under the applicable severance agreements for our NEOs. The severance agreements provide that a
“qualifying termination” means a termination of employment either by us without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason,” each as defined in the applicable
severance agreement. An executive is not deemed to have experienced a qualifying termination as a result of (a) his or her death or disability or (b) solely as a result of a
severance agreement. An executive is not deemed to have experienced a qualifying termination as a result of (a) his or her death or disability or (b) solely as a result of a
change in control. Under the applicable severance agreement, in the event of a qualifying termination within 24 months of a change in control, each NEO would be
entitled to receive a cash severance amount equal to 2.5 times (in the case of Mr. Wang) or 2.0 times (in the case of the other NEOs) the sum of the executive’s annual
base salary at the rate in effect at the time of such termination and annual target cash incentive award under the short-term incentive plan for the year in which such
termination occurs. The NEO also would be entitled to a pro rata bonus for the year in which his or her qualifying termination occurred. For purposes of this table, we
have assumed that the NEOs received a pro rata target bonus for 2021.
 
(2)
Reflects double-trigger equity acceleration benefits. The merger will constitute a “change in control” under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended. If the NEO’s
employment is terminated by us ‘’without cause” or by the NEO for “good reason” within 12 months following a change in control, then (i) all unvested service-based
RSUs will immediately vest; (ii) all unvested stock options will immediately vest and become exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the options or 90 days after
the termination date; and (iii) the performance-based RSUs will immediately vest at actual performance, or at target if performance cannot reasonably be assessed. For
the purposes of this table, we have assumed that the performance-based RSUs vested at target.
 
(3)
The merger will constitute a “change in control” under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “EDCP”), pursuant to which certain of our named executive
officers have elected to defer salary and/or bonus amounts. Pursuant to the terms of such plan, we are required to distribute to all plan participants all deferred amounts
within thirty (30) days following the closing of the merger. However, all deferred compensation accounts are fully vested and only comprise those earned amounts that
our executive officers have elected to defer. The merger does not result in any benefit enhancements under the EDCP.
 
(4)
Reflects double-trigger benefits under the severance agreements. Under the applicable severance agreements for our NEOs, upon a “qualifying termination,” each NEO is
entitled to continued healthcare coverage in an amount equal to the excess of the cost of the coverage over the amount that the executive would have had to pay if the
executive remained employed for 18 months following the date of termination. In addition, to the extent we provide the executive’s life insurance coverage immediately
prior to the qualifying termination and this coverage is eligible for post-termination continuation or conversion to an individual policy, each NEO is entitled to receive a
cash payment equal to the amount required to continue such coverage as an individual policy for a period of 12 months following the termination date (and, if we deem
necessary or advisable, to convert such coverage to an individual policy), payable in a single lump sum within 60 days following the termination date.
 
(5)
As previously disclosed, Ms. Silver will separate from the Company after the consummation of the merger as part of our planned integration of the Diamond business and
synergy in connection with the merger.
 
(6)
Ms. Hollkamp separated from the Company effective July 31, 2020.
Our Board of Directors Following the Merger
Upon the effective time of the merger, our board of directors will expand from its current size of seven members to nine members. All seven members
of our board of directors prior to the merger will remain on our

Table of Contents
board of directors following the merger, and, pursuant to the stockholders agreement, two new members designated by the Apollo Investors will be
appointed to our board of directors at the effective time of the merger. See “Other Agreements—Stockholders Agreement” below, for more information
about the stockholders agreements and Apollo’s right to appoint certain designees to our board of directors.
Regulatory Clearances Required for the Merger
We and Diamond have agreed to use each of our reasonable best efforts to obtain all governmental and regulatory clearances and approvals
required to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including our reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) take all such actions as may be required
to obtain all antitrust approvals as promptly as possible after the execution of the merger agreement and no later than the merger agreement Termination
Date, including such action that would (A) require the divestiture of any businesses, properties, rights or assets, or portions thereof, of HGV, Diamond, or
any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, (B) limit HGV’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, Diamond and its
subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their businesses, properties, rights or assets, or portions thereof, or any of HGV’s or its subsidiaries or affiliates’ other
businesses, properties, rights or assets, or portions thereof, or (C) limit HGV’s ability to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to
Diamond and its subsidiaries or affiliates, provided that (x) such action is conditioned on consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and (y) such action would not require HGV to sell, divest, assign, dispose of or hold separate any businesses, properties, rights or assets of
HGV, Diamond or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, or agree to, or enter into any conditions or mitigation agreements or other remedies with
respect to, any businesses, properties, rights or assets of HGV, Diamond or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, that (together with all other
businesses, properties, rights and assets that are subject to antitrust remedies) generated more than $75,000,000 in revenues during the parties’ respective
most recently completed fiscal years.
United States Antitrust. Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given
and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. We and Diamond filed
the Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on March 29, 2021, and the other Apollo Investors completed their respective
filings on March 30, 2021. The relevant waiting periods expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern on April 28, 2021 and April 29, 2021.
It is not out of the ordinary for the FTC and the Antitrust Division to scrutinize the legality of transactions like the merger under U.S. antitrust laws.
At any time before or after the consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
FTC or Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to
enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any U.S. state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in
the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. Although there is no assurance that they will not
do so, we do not expect any regulatory authority, state or private party to take legal action under the antitrust laws.
Mexican Antitrust. The approval of the merger by the COFECE under the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law is required to consummate
the merger. Under the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law, transactions involving parties with sales/assets above certain thresholds cannot be
completed until they are reviewed and approved by COFECE. We, Diamond and the Apollo Investors filed a formal notification to COFECE of the merger
on April 9, 2021 and COFECE unanimously and unconditionally approved the merger on June 10, 2021.
 
77
Table of Contents
Austrian Antitrust. The approval of the merger by the Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde (“BWB”), or Federal Competition Authority, under the Austrian
Cartel Act and the Competition Act is required to consummate the merger. Under the Austrian Cartel Act and the Competition Act, transactions involving
parties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until they are reviewed and approved by the BWB. We and Diamond filed a formal
notification to the BWB of the merger on April 9, 2021 and received formal notice of unconditional clearance on May 10, 2021.
We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.
Treatment of Diamond Equity-Based Awards
Each in-the-money option, whether vested or unvested, will automatically cease to be outstanding and be converted into and exchanged for the
right to receive, without any interest thereon, a number of shares of our common stock and/or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock
equal to the option consideration (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions applicable to such in-the-money option).
All Diamond options outstanding immediately prior to the effective time that are not in-the-money options will (i) to the extent not then vested,
become fully vested as of immediately prior to the effective time (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions applicable to such
option) and (ii) automatically be cancelled and terminated at the effective time without payment therefor, and, to such extent, will have no further force or
effect.

The merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP, with us being considered the acquiror.
This means that we will allocate the aggregate merger consideration to assets and liabilities of Diamond based on their estimated fair values as of the date

Description of Debt Financing
Overview
In connection with the merger, HGV intends to issue or borrow, or to cause one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries to issue or borrow, a combination
of debt securities in a private offering, term loans and/or revolving loans. On March 25, 2021, HGV entered into the commitment letter with Bank of
America, N.A., BofA Securities, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch,
Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank
USA, MUFG Bank, Ltd. and each of the other banks and
 
78Table of Contents
lending institutions party thereto, pursuant to which the commitment parties have agreed to provide (i) a $675.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan
facility and (ii) a $1.3 billion seven-year senior secured term loan facility. The commitment parties’ obligation to fund the term loan facility is subject to
several limited conditions as set forth in the commitment letter, including, among others, completion of the merger substantially concurrently with the
funding of the term loan facility the non-occurrence of a company material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on Diamond, the accuracy
in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to both HGV and Diamond, the delivery of certain financial statements of HGV and
Diamond and other customary conditions.
On May 20, 2021, we priced an unregistered offering of $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2029, which closed
on June 4, 2021. Upon issuance of such senior notes into escrow, the commitments in respect of the bridge facility were terminated.
On June 14, 2021, we priced an unregistered offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2031, which is
expected to close on June 28, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
Term Loan Facility
Pursuant to the terms of the commitment letter, the proceeds of the loans under the term loan facility will be available upon the satisfaction of
several limited conditions precedent on completion of the merger and will be used, together with the proceeds of the 2029 notes and the 2031 notes to
finance the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of HGV and Diamond and to pay fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the
merger. The loans under the term loan facility will mature on the seven-year anniversary after funding thereof.
Conditions Precedent
The commitment parties’ obligation to fund the loans under the term loan facility is subject to several limited conditions, including completion of
the merger substantially concurrently with the funding of the term loan facility, the non-occurrence of a company material adverse effect (as such term is
defined in the merger agreement) on Diamond, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to both HGV and
Diamond, the delivery of certain financial statements of HGV and Diamond and other customary conditions more fully set forth in the commitment letter.
Interest
At the option of HGV Borrower, borrowings under the term loan facility will bear interest at either a base rate or at an annual rate equal to the
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), for deposits with a corresponding term in U.S. dollars adjusted for applicable statutory reserve requirements
(such rate as so adjusted is referred to in this proxy statement as the “reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate”), plus, in each case, an applicable margin and
subject to a 0.50% LIBOR floor. The applicable margin for the term facility will be 2.00% per annum with respect to base rate borrowings, and 3.00% per
annum with respect to the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate borrowings.
If the base rate option is selected by HGV Borrower, interest will be at the base rate plus the applicable margin, calculated on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days (or 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in the case base rate loans based upon the “prime rate”) and
payable quarterly in arrears. The base rate will be, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate publicly announced by the
administrative agent as its “prime rate”, (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (iii) the one-month reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate
(provided, that the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, plus 1.00% and (iv) 1.00%.

Table of Contents
If the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate option is selected by HGV Borrower, interest will be determined based on interest periods to be selected by
HGV Borrower of one, three or six months or (if agreed by all relevant lenders under the term loan facility) twelve months or, to the extent agreed to by the
administrative agent, a shorter period and for each interest period will be at an annual rate equal to LIBOR, for deposits with a term equivalent to such
interest period in U.S. dollars adjusted for applicable reserve requirements, plus the applicable margin. Interest will be paid at the end of each interest
period (and at the end of every three months, in the case of interest periods longer than three months) and will be calculated on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.
Covenants and Events of Default
The commitment letter provides that the definitive financing agreement documenting the term loan facility, which is referred to in this proxy
statement as the “term loan credit agreement”, will contain covenants substantially similar to the covenants in credit agreement, dated as of December 28,
2016, among HGV Borrower, the guarantors party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended prior to the date of the
commitment letter, the “existing credit agreement”), which, in each case, relate to, among other things, the following subjects:

other amounts); failure to perform negative covenants (and affirmative covenants to provide notice of default or maintain HGV Borrower’s corporate

definitive agreement or the fee letter referred to in the commitment letter without the prior written consent of the seller representative in a manner that
(i) would prevent or materially delay the timing of the funding of the commitments thereunder or make the timely funding of the debt financing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the debt financing materially less likely to occur or (ii) adversely impact the ability of HGV to enforce its rights
under the commitment letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Diamond or one of its subsidiaries to, provide (i) a base salary or base wages to each continuing Diamond employee at a rate that is no less than the

immediately prior to the Closing Date.
If requested by HGV not less than ten business days before the Closing Date, Diamond or its applicable subsidiary will terminate the Diamond
Resorts 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Diamond 401(k) Plan”), effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. In the event that the Diamond 401(k) Plan

HGV, the Apollo Investors and, for certain limited purposes, Hilton, have agreed to a “form of” stockholders agreement, which the parties will enter
into as of the effective time of the merger. This stockholders agreement will govern the terms of the Apollo Investors’ investment in HGV post-closing.
The following is a summary of the terms of the stockholders agreement.
Board and Governance Terms
Board Seats
The Apollo Investors will initially be entitled to designate two individuals (the “Apollo Designees”) to serve on our board of directors (out of a
total of nine directors). The Apollo Investors have indicated that the initial designees will be David Sambur and Alex van Hoek. The Apollo Investors
also have the right to designate replacements for the initial Apollo Designees, subject to undergoing a customary evaluation process by our nominating
and corporate governance committee.
If we increase the size of our board of directors, for every three additional directors added, the Apollo Investors may appoint the third such
director, so long as the Apollo Investors (or their affiliates who have executed a joinder agreement to become party to the stockholders agreement, which
we refer to in this section, collectively, as the “Apollo parties”) still hold a number of shares equal to 20% of our total outstanding shares of common
stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing.
The right to designate members of our board of directors will step down as the Apollo parties’ ownership decreases. When the Apollo parties no
longer own a number of the shares received at the closing of the merger equal to (i) 15% of our total outstanding shares of common stock immediately
after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing, one Apollo Designee will be required to resign and (ii) 10% of our total outstanding
shares of common stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing, the second Apollo Designee will be required to
resign and the Apollo Investors will no longer be entitled to any representation on our board of directors. The Apollo Investors cannot buy back into the
right to designate any Apollo Designees to our board of directors. The shares are not fungible, so the Apollo parties must retain the relevant number of
shares from those received in the merger at closing.
Board Committees
One Apollo Designee will be entitled to serve on the Audit Committee, subject to satisfaction of all eligibility requirements (including
“independence” requirements) for membership on the Audit Committee as mandated by applicable law, the rules of the NYSE and the charter of the Audit
Committee. Additionally, each of the Apollo Designees will have observation rights and will be entitled to notice of, and to attend, committee meetings
except when such attendance would reasonably be expected to present an actual or likely conflict of interest for the Apollo Designees in the good faith
opinion of the applicable committee. However, the Apollo Designees (except with respect to an Apollo Designee who is a member of the Audit
Committee) will not be entitled to a vote at such committee meetings.
 
106Table of Contents
Transfer Restrictions
The Apollo parties are subject to a 180 day lock-up period post-closing. Only certain “Permitted Transfers” (as such term is defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) are allowed during this period, including transfers to affiliates (subject to such affiliates executing a joinder agreement) and
transfers pursuant to a bona fide loan or other financing arrangement.
After the lock-up period, the Apollo parties may freely transfer their shares, so long as such transfers (i) comply with the volume and manner of
sale restrictions in Rule 144, (ii) (a) are to any person or group are of less than 5% of the total outstanding stock, and (b) are not to certain competitors of
HGV or Hilton, known holders of 5% or more of HGV’s common stock or known activists, or (iii) are pursuant to an underwritten offering or a broker-
facilitated block trade, in each case, so long as the Apollo parties direct the applicable underwriter(s) or broker(s) to comply with the restrictions set forth
in clause (ii) of this sentence.
HGV will have certain pre-emptive rights on transfers by the Apollo parties, and the Apollo parties will provide HGV with two days’ prior written
notice in advance of consummating a proposed transfer (unless the notice is delivered before 9:00 am on a Friday, in which case the notice period only
lasts until 4:00 pm on such day), and during the notice period will consider in good faith any written offer made by HGV to purchase all or any portion of
the HGV stock that the Apollo party proposes to transfer.
Standstill Obligations
The Apollo parties will be subject to standstill obligations so long as (i) the Apollo parties own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total
outstanding shares of our common stock at closing or (ii) the Apollo parties have the right to designate at least one director, including, subject to certain
exceptions, prohibitions against:
 
 
•
 acquiring shares or debt of HGV;
 
 
•
 publicly offering to acquire HGV;
 
 
•
 soliciting proxies or influencing any voting of our common stock;
 
 
•
 seeking to control or influence of Board (including removal/election) or HGV management;
 
 
•
 initiating HGV stockholder proposals or seeking action by HGV stockholders;
 
 
•
 forming or joining a “group” with respect to the common stock of HGV (other than a group consisting solely of Apollo parties);
 
 
•
 seeking to control or influence HGV management or policies (alone or with others);
 
 
•
 advising, assisting, encouraging or entering into arrangements with anyone with respect to any of the above;
 
 
•
 arranging or providing any financing for the acquisition of common stock or assets of HGV by anyone generally (other than as permitted by
the stockholders agreement);
 
 
•
 publicly disclosing any intention, plan, or arrangement inconsistent with any of the above that an Apollo party knows, or would reasonably
be expected to know, would require HGV to make a public announcement regarding any of the foregoing activities; and
 
 
•
 contesting the validity of the above restrictions or challenging any ‘poison pill’ or similar anti-takeover device.
If the Apollo parties no longer own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, the standstill provision
will terminate on the later of (i) the day after the next annual stockholders meeting and (ii) 90 days after the first date on which the Apollo parties’
ownership falls below such 5% level.
 
107
Table of Contents
The Apollo parties will be permitted to acquire additional shares of HGV common stock, so long as such acquisitions do not exceed the lower of
(i) the Apollo Investors’ ownership level of HGV common stock at the closing of the merger and (ii) the Apollo Investors’ ownership level of HGV
common stock at the closing of the merger less the number of shares of HGV common stock transferred by the Apollo parties to a person other than
another Apollo Entity (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement) plus 2% of the total outstanding shares of HGV common stock
immediately prior to such purchase.
Voting Matters
So long as the Apollo parties own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock at closing, the Apollo
parties are obligated to vote all of their shares as recommended by our board of directors with respect to routine matters (including contested or
uncontested elections of directors, “say on pay” votes, approval of equity compensation plans and ratification of the selection of HGV’s auditors).
Additionally, as described under “Standstill Obligations” above, the Apollo parties will agree to customary restrictions with respect to solicitation
of proxies and voting of shares in contested elections. Otherwise, the Apollo parties will be free to vote their shares in their sole discretion up to the
number of shares that represents the Apollo Investors’ ownership percentage at the closing of the merger. If at any time the Apollo parties’ ownership
percentage exceeds what it was at the closing of the merger (due to share repurchases or another reduction in the total number of shares outstanding),
then any excess shares must be voted pro rata with other HGV stockholders.
Consent Rights
So long as the Apollo parties hold a number of shares equal to at least 10% of our total outstanding shares of common stock immediately after the
closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing, the consent of the Apollo parties will be required to (i) amend HGV’s charter or bylaws in a
manner that would require stockholder approval and would materially, disproportionately and adversely affect the rights of the Apollo parties or
(ii) increase the size of our board of directors to exceed twelve directors; provided, that the Apollo parties have no such consent right for amendments to
HGV’s charter or bylaws to adopt poison pills approved by our board of directors.
Additionally, the stockholders agreement may not be amended without the written consent of both HGV and the Apollo Investors (and, in some
cases, Hilton).
Registration Rights
The Apollo parties can make up to six demands to have HGV register the shares of our common stock received in connection with the
consummation of the merger, subject to standard carve-outs. Certain affiliates of Reverence Capital Partners (the “Reverence parties”) and the other
selling stockholders have the right to participate in any of the demand registrations, and the Reverence parties and Apollo parties have “piggyback”
rights allowing them to participate in registered public offerings by HGV.
If eligible to file a Form S-3, HGV must file the requested registration statement within 45 days of the written demand for registration. If not eligible,
HGV must file a registration statement on another form as expeditiously as possible. HGV must keep the registration effective for at least 180 days after
the effective date (or such shorter period during which all registrable securities have been sold), subject to extension in the event of any required
suspension of sales.
The Apollo parties are responsible for paying all expenses for the registration of their shares.
 
108
Table of Contents
Pre-emptive Rights
The Apollo parties will have limited preemptive rights on certain future equity issuances, subject to customary carve-outs and limitations, so long
as the Apollo parties own an aggregate of 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to
the stock issuance at closing. The Apollo parties will be able to participate in such issuances up to an amount equal to their then-current ownership
percentage.
Confidentiality and Non-Use
The Apollo Designees will sign a customary confidentiality and non-use agreement in substantially the same form as signed by other members of
our board of directors.
In addition, Apollo Designees who serve, or have served in the preceding twelve months, on HGV’s Board shall not serve on the board of directors
of certain competitors of HGV or Hilton, or serve on the board of directors of any Apollo Entity (as defined in the stockholders agreement) that has a
significant interest in such competitors. The Apollo parties are also prohibited from acquiring a significant interest in such competitors that would result
in such competitor becoming an affiliate of any Apollo Entity.
Termination
Generally, the stockholders agreement terminates when the Apollo parties no longer own a number of shares equal to 5% of our total outstanding
shares of common stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing; provided, that certain provisions have earlier
termination dates as noted above.
Hilton Consent to Certain Amendments or Waivers
Hilton will be a party to the stockholders agreement solely for the purpose of requiring its consent prior to any amendments to or waivers of certain
provisions that govern (a) corporate governance matters, (b) voting matters, (c) transfer restrictions and (d) standstill obligations.
Hilton Agreements and Consent",114,117
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,Hilton Agreements and Consent,"Hilton Agreements and Consent
In connection with, and as part of, us entering into the merger agreement, we obtained the Hilton consent and entered into the Hilton agreements.
Hilton Consent
Our original license agreement with Hilton requires us to obtain Hilton’s prior written consent before completing certain significant transactions,
including the acquisition of Diamond through the merger. As part of us entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger and the related
transactions, we obtained the Hilton consent simultaneously with the signing of the merger agreement. The Hilton consent is effective as of the date of
the merger agreement and is irrevocable unless: (a) the merger agreement is materially amended between signing and closing of the merger, (b) if the form
of the stockholders agreement and related arrangements are amended with respect to certain sections over which Hilton would have consent rights as
described above under “—Stockholders Agreement”; (c) if we or Diamond are required by any governmental authority to divest of certain assets or
properties in excess of a certain dollar threshold (which threshold is higher than the threshold set forth in the merger agreement; see “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger”); or (d) if the merger has not been consummated by the outside date set forth in the merger
agreement. The Hilton consent also provides that, if the merger has not been consummated by the outside date, the A&R Hilton license agreement will be
null and void and the parties’ arrangement will revert back to the original license agreement.
 
109Table of Contents
Hilton Agreements
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, we and Hilton entered into the A&R Hilton license agreement, which replaced the original
license agreement in its entirety, and certain other arrangements. These Hilton agreements are intended to facilitate our integration of the Diamond
business and created a separate license fee structure related to such integration.
Among other items, the A&R Hilton license agreement provides for a gradual ramp-up of royalty fee structure over the initial five (5) years
following the closing of the merger, ranging from 2.0% to 5.0% of applicable revenue, with respect to:
 
 
•
 sales of interests or rights to use in a new exchange club or membership (“New Club”) to be developed by us after the closing of the merger
as part of the Diamond integration that may cover both HGV’s current properties and Diamond properties that we anticipate will convert into
Hilton Vacation Club or other HGV-branded properties (“New Brand Properties”); and
 
 
•
 various property-level revenues associated with New Brand Properties, such as transient rental revenues.
The A&R Hilton license agreement also provides for a ramp-up of royalty fees over the initial five (5) years following the closing of the merger for
certain HOA expenses, ranging from 0% to 1.5%.
The new ramp-up royalty fee structure applies only to the Diamond business and any conversion of existing Diamond properties to our branded
properties and the A&R Hilton license agreement did not modify the current royalty fee and other fee structures from the original license agreement.
Accordingly, our current business and existing properties or any new properties that we may acquire or open will continue to be subject to the original
royalty fee structure. The conversion of any Diamond property into our branded property is subject to an approval process by Hilton.
The A&R Hilton license agreement, together with other arrangements entered into at the same time, also made the following additional changes:
 
 
•
 extended our original exclusivity period known as the “Initial Noncompetition Term” (as defined in the A&R Hilton license agreement) by
five (5) years to December 31, 2051;
 
 
•
 amended certain provisions related to the parties’ respective obligations with respect to Hilton’s current co-branded credit card program;
 
 
•
 modified certain marketing rights, marketing channel rights, and lead generation; and
 
 
•
 modified certain hotel rate discount provisions for our VOI owners, employee participation in certain Hilton employee programs, and
branding and licensed mark provisions relating to New Brand Properties and New Club.
Under the A&R Hilton license agreement, we are required to operate the Diamond business as a “Separate Operation,” as such term is defined
therein, subject to the approved conversion of any Diamond property to our branded property. We and Hilton are currently in discussions to further
amend such requirements, with any such amendments to be agreed to by Hilton in its sole discretion, so as to allow us to operate the Diamond business
in a manner that would optimize efficiency and synergy.
Stockholders Agreement
As previously discussed, Hilton will be a party to our stockholders agreement with the Apollo Investors solely with respect to certain provisions
of the stockholders agreement. Accordingly, certain sections of the stockholders agreement that relate to certain corporate governance matters, transfer
restrictions relating to our common stock, certain voting obligations of the Apollo Investors, and standstill provisions may not be amended or waived
without Hilton’s consent. See “—Stockholders Agreement” beginning on page 106 of this proxy statement.

Business Overview
Diamond and certain of its subsidiaries were established to complete the merger of DRI with certain Apollo affiliates, which was completed on
September 2, 2016 (the “Apollo Merger”). DRI is a holding company, the principal asset of which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in
its subsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating subsidiary that has historically conducted the business described
below. See “Note 1:— Business, Background and Basis of Presentation” to the audited consolidated and unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of Diamond included in this proxy statement.
Diamond is a global leader in the hospitality and vacation ownership industry, with a vast resort network of global vacation destinations located
around the world, including the continental U.S., Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New
Zealand and Africa.
Diamond’s operations consist of two interrelated businesses:
 
 
•
 Vacation Interests sales and financing, which includes marketing and sales of VOIs and consumer financing for purchasers of our VOIs.
Diamond derives a majority of its revenue and operating cash flows from the VOI sales and financing segment, primarily driven by sales and
marketing efforts at channels that predominately include managed resorts, on-site sales centers at affiliated resorts and local venues; and
 
 
•
 Hospitality and management services, which includes operations related to the management of the homeowners associations (the “VOAs”),
multi-resort trusts and the Diamond Collections, operations of the exchange programs, operation of certain resort amenities and the
provision of other hospitality and management services.
Significant Events
Hilton Grand Vacation Merger Agreement
On March 10, 2021, HGV, Merger Sub, Dakota Holdings, and certain stockholders of Dakota Holdings entered into the merger agreement. The
merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in accordance with applicable law, Dakota Holdings
will merge with Merger Sub with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity after the merger.
Diamond’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interest of Dakota Holdings and its stockholders, and authorized, approved and declared
advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.
The Apollo Investors and the Dakota Holdings’ other stockholders are expected to receive 34.7 million of HGV common shares, valued at
approximately $1.6 billion (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021), subject to customary adjustments. Upon closing of the merger, existing HGV
stockholders will own approximately 72% of the combined company and Apollo and the other Diamond stockholders will own approximately 28% of the
combined company on a fully diluted basis, subject to adjustments under the merger agreement. In connection with the merger, HGV intends to repay
Diamond’s Senior Facilities and First Lien Notes at the closing of the merger.
Among other things, the closing is subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the proposed issuance of HGV common shares in
connection with the merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matter at a special
meeting of stockholders. See “Note
 
111Table of Contents
25—Subsequent Events” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this proxy statement for additional information
related to terms and conditions of the merger agreement.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020 the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31. 2021 include impacts related to COVID-19 which have had a negative impact on Diamond and
the travel and hospitality industry. In response to social distancing directives and significant restrictions on travel caused by COVID-19, Diamond
initially closed most of its resorts and suspended its onsite sales and marketing operations. Diamond has taken several steps to enhance liquidity,
preserve cash, reduce expenditures and provide financial flexibility, and the company’s management is continuing to assess the evolving situation and
will take actions as appropriate. These include measures such as: reductions in both salaries and workforce, including voluntary reductions in salaries by
its executive leadership team; unpaid employee furloughs; temporary elimination of 401(k) matching; and deferral of all -non-essential operating and
capital expenditures.
Beginning in May 2020, as governmental authorities began to lift restrictions, Diamond worked with health experts in establishing reopening safety
protocols. Diamond implemented and trained team members on the “Diamond Standard of Clean.” Since late May 2020, Diamond has re-opened the
majority of its North American Portfolio Properties and onsite sales centers, albeit at reduced capacity levels and revenue has not returned to pre-COVID-
19 levels. Although certain of the Diamond Club offerings and member benefits, such as cruise itineraries, remain unavailable, Diamond expects total
revenue to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels late in 2021. Diamond continues to monitor travel restrictions and prioritize the safety of our customers and
employees. This involves a continuous assessment of whether the closure of resorts is necessary due to potential tightening of government restrictions,
stay-at-home orders and the potential resurgence of coronavirus cases.
Diamond considered the income tax accounting and disclosure implications of the relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (“CARES”) Act enacted on March 27, 2020. The effect of tax law changes is generally required to be recognized in the interim period in which the
legislation is enacted and reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2020, Diamond evaluated the income tax
provisions of the CARES Act and determined there to be an immaterial effect on the December 31, 2020 computation of the effective income tax rate for
the year. Diamond will continue to evaluate the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and monitor the developments in the jurisdictions where
Diamond has significant operations for tax law changes that could have income tax accounting and disclosure implications. Diamond recorded $6.6 million
of employee retention payroll tax credits pursuant to the CARES Act and similar foreign government programs in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Based on Diamond’s current estimates regarding the magnitude and length of the disruptions to its business, it does not anticipate these
disruptions will impact its ability to meet its obligations when due or is ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants for at least the next 12 months.
However, the ultimate magnitude and length of time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This uncertainty will require
Diamond’s management team to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions. Accordingly,
Diamond’s estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the company’s results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.
Debt Amendments
Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility
On July 15, 2020, Diamond amended the Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility to reduce the maximum commitment amount for aggregate borrowings from
$250.0 million to $200.0 million and provide flexibility with respect to satisfying certain financial covenants through the first quarter of 2021 due to the
ongoing and uncertain future impact of COVID-19.

Table of Contents
Capital One Conduit Facility
On August 4, 2020, Diamond entered into an amendment and waiver agreement related to its warehouse loan facility with Capital One, National
Association (the “Waiver”). The Waiver provided flexibility with respect to satisfying certain financial covenants with respect to pledged collateral for
the second quarter of 2020.
 
On September 30, 2020, Diamond amended the Capital One Conduit Facility to: (i) extend the stated maturity to September 30, 2024 and the
commitment expiration to September 30, 2022 and, (ii) provide additional flexibility with respect to certain financial covenants through the second quarter
of 2021.
Senior Facilities
On August 12, 2020 and September 16, 2020, Diamond entered into incremental assumption agreements with certain lenders of Diamond’s Senior
Facilities primarily to extend the maturity of an aggregate $100.0 million of revolving facility commitments from September 2, 2021 to June 2, 2023.
Credit Suisse Conduit Facility
On August 24, 2020, Diamond amended the Credit Suisse Conduit Facility to: (i) extend the stated maturity to August 24, 2023 and the commitment
expiration to August 24, 2022; (ii) reduce the maximum commitment amount for aggregate borrowings from $300.0 million to $200.0 million and, (iii) provide
flexibility with respect to satisfying certain financial covenants through the second quarter of 2021 due to the ongoing and uncertain future impact
of COVID-19 (that certain ninth amended and restated note funding agreement, dated as of August 24, 2020, as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the “Note Funding Agreement”). The maximum commitment can be increased up to $300.0 million prior to the
commitment expiration date subject to consent by all parties to the amended Note Funding Agreement.
Wells Fargo Conduit Facility
On September 9, 2020, Diamond terminated the Wells Fargo Conduit Facility which historically provided for a maximum commitment amount of
$75.0 million. Diamond paid $29.3 million to redeem the remaining aggregate principal amount of commitments outstanding.
Early Redemption of DROT 2016-1
On January 20, 2021, Diamond gave notice to exercise early redemption of the securitization notes outstanding under Diamond Resorts Owner
Trust 2016-1 (“DROT 2016-1”) in the amount of $19.0 million, which includes aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest. The redemption was
completed on February 22, 2021.
Merger Signing Amendments
On March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments and a commitment letter relating to the Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility for the
purpose of amending the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility, as of the date thereof and as may be
further amended in the future, to accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.
On March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments relating to the Capital One Conduit Facility for the purpose of amending the terms of
the operative legal documents relating to the Capital One Conduit Facility, as of the date thereof and as may be further amended in the future, to
accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.

2021, as set forth below, and as may be further amended in the future, to accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.
Natixis Conduit Facility
On May 6, 2021, Diamond amended the Natixis Conduit Facility to renew a line of credit provided by Natixis, New York Branch with a maximum
commitment amount of $125 million and to amend the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Natixis Conduit Facility to accommodate
changes relating to the Merger.
Subsequent Events
Issuance of DROT 2021-1
On April 20, 2021, Diamond completed a securitization transaction involving the issuance of $319.2 million of securities (the DROT 2021-1 Notes”).
The DROT 2021-1 Notes consists of four tranches of Vacation Interest notes receivable that include $134.1 million of Class A tranche notes, $83.2 million
of Class B tranche notes, $65.4 million of Class C tranche notes and $36.5 million of Class D tranche notes. The interest rates for the Class A tranche
notes, the Class B tranche notes, the Class C tranche notes and the Class D tranche notes are 1.51%, 2.05%, 2.70% and 3.83% respectively. The overall
weighted average interest rate of the DROT 2021-1 Notes is 2.16%.
The proceeds of the DROT 2021-1 Notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under certain Funding Facilities in the amount of $134.1 million
in principal and accrued interest. The DROT 2021-1 Notes allow for a prefunding amount of $79.8 million which is available to draw subject to eligible
Vacation Interests notes receivable requirements as outlined in the DROT 2021-1 indenture. The remaining proceeds were used to fund reserve accounts
and pay costs associated with the transaction with the remaining cash transferred to Diamond for general corporate purpose.
Segment Reporting
For financial reporting purposes, Diamond presents its results of operations and financial condition in two reportable segments: Vacation Interests
sales and financing and hospitality and management services, which include the operations as discussed above in “—Business Overview.” Certain line
items reflected on its statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) fall completely into one of these reportable segments, while other line
items relate to both segments; specifically, other revenue and loan portfolio expense, which are allocated to the appropriate segment based on the nature
of the underlying transactions. Certain expense items, principally corporate interest expense, depreciation and amortization and provision for income
taxes, are not, in management’s view, allocable to either of these reportable segments as they apply to all operations of the business. In addition, general
and administrative expenses are not allocated to either of Diamond’s reportable segments because historically management has not allocated these
expenses for purposes of evaluating our different operational divisions. Accordingly, these expenses are presented under corporate and other.

Consolidated Results
Total revenues increased $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily from
a combination of the following:
 
 
•
 $10.3 million of higher revenues in the Vacation Interests sales and financing segment resulting from a $16.6 million increase in Vacation
Interests sales, net, due to a decrease in the provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales of $71.8 million, which was primarily due to
an incremental loan loss included in the provision, related to COVID-19 of $0.0 million and $45 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 and 2020. The remaining decrease was due to lower gross Vacation Interests sales; which was partially offset by a decrease in
consumer financing interest revenue of $2.3 million primarily due to a reduction in the balance of the notes receivable portfolio from the prior
period and a decrease in other revenue of a $4.4 million due to reduction in closing costs revenue from gross Vacation Interests sales and
lower business levels due to COVID-19.

Table of Contents
 
•
 $8.7 million of lower revenues in the hospitality and management services segment primarily resulting from a decrease in management and
member services revenue of $8.3 million mainly as a result of a decrease in room, food and beverage, and ancillary revenue primarily driven
by reduced resorts’ capacity and ongoing travel restrictions related to COVID-19.
Total operating costs and expenses decreased $149.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2020 primarily from a combination of the following:
 
 
•
 $145.1 million of lower operating costs and expenses in the Vacation Interests sales and financing segment primarily attributable to a
decrease in advertising, sales and marketing expense of $32.6 million largely driven by the decrease in gross Vacation Interests sales; and
cost reduction efforts related to COVID-19; a decrease in goodwill impairment charge related to the NA VISF reporting unit of $103.4 million
and a decrease in incremental allowance for credit losses related to the Acquired Notes of $14.1 million. The decrease was partially offset by
an increase in Vacation Interests carrying costs, net of $6.8 million, which was primarily driven by lower rental revenues of $13.3 million,
decrease in usage of sales incentives, and partially offset by a decrease in inventory carrying costs of $6.5 million.
 
 
•
 $10.9 million of lower operating costs and expenses in the hospitality and management services segment primarily as a result of a decrease
in management and member services expense of $10.8 million mainly as a result of a reduction in resorts’ capacity and ongoing travel
restrictions related to COVID-19.
 
 
•
 $6.6 million of higher unallocated corporate costs primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million
primarily driven by acquisition related expenses for the HGV Merger.
Our effective income tax rate of 13.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the effect of
certain foreign income and losses included in U.S. taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances applied to certain foreign losses and permanent
book-tax differences.

Gross Vacation Interests sales decreased by $55.2 million, or 30.2%, primarily due to a decrease in tours of 17,886 resulting from lower arrivals due to
COVID-19 partially offset by higher VPG of $947 driven primarily by an increase in average transaction price. The increase in Vacation Interest sales, net
of $16.6 million, or 20.2%, is primarily offset by a decrease in the provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales of $71.8 million primarily due to the
$45.0 million in additional provision incurred for COVID-19 and the remaining change due to lower gross Vacation Interests sales.
Consumer financing interest revenue decreased $2.3 million, or 8.2%, primarily due to a reduction in the balance of the notes receivable portfolio
from the prior period.
Other revenue decreased $4.0 million, or 21.4%, primarily due to a decrease in closing costs revenue from gross Vacation Interests sales and lower
business levels due to COVID-19.
Advertising, sales and marketing expense decreased $32.6 million, or 31.6%, primarily driven by the decrease in gross Vacation Interests sales and
cost reduction efforts related COVID-19.
Vacation Interests carrying cost, net increased $6.8 million primarily due to lower rental revenues and usage of sales incentives and partially offset
by a decrease in inventory carrying costs of $6.5 million.

Consolidated Results
Total revenues decreased $461.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily from a
combination of the following:
 
 
•
 $429.4 million of lower revenues in Vacation Interests sales and financing segment resulting from a $396.0 million decrease in Vacation
Interests sales, net primarily attributable to a decrease in tours due to COVID-19, partially offset by an decrease in the provision for
uncollectible Vacation Interests sales of $8.2 million primarily due to lower gross Vacation Interests sales which is partially offset by
$45.0 million incremental provision attributable to higher expected defaults resulting from economic uncertainty driven by the COVID-19
pandemic; and a $33.0 million decrease in other revenue largely due to decrease in insurance settlements received in as a result of Hurricane
Irma as well as a decrease in closing costs revenue from gross Vacation Interests sales.

Table of Contents
 
•
 $31.9 million lower revenues in Diamond’s hospitality and management services segment primarily resulting from a decrease in management
and member services revenue of $34.0 million mainly as a result of a decrease in room, food and beverage, and ancillary revenue primarily
related to the temporary closure of the Modern resort.
Total operating costs and expenses decreased $174.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily from a combination of the following:
 
 
•
 $108.0 million of lower operating costs and expenses in Diamond’s Vacation Interests sales and financing segment primarily attributable to a
decrease in advertising, sales and marketing expense of $205.2 million due to the decrease in gross Vacation Interests sales and a decrease in
Vacation Interests cost of sales of $72.2 million primarily due to the decrease in Vacation Interests sales, net as well as a reduction in cost-off
rate resulting from current-period changes in estimates under the relative sales value method; partially offset by a $103.4 million goodwill
impairment charge related to Diamond’s NA VISF reporting unit and a $14.1 million incremental allowance for credit losses related to the
Acquired Notes; and a $64.7 million increase in Vacation Interests carrying costs, net driven mainly by lower rental revenues and usage of
sales incentives and lower costs associated with these items.
 
 
•
 $40.5 million of lower operating costs and expenses in Diamond’s hospitality and management services segment primarily as a result of a
decrease in management and member services expense of $40.3 million mainly as a result of the temporary closure of the Modern resort.
 
 
•
 $26.0 million of lower unallocated corporate costs, primarily attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $24.8 million
driven largely by a $12.5 million decrease in legal and professional costs related to corporate development activities as well as a reduction in
payroll and related costs due to employee furloughs and cost saving measures as a result of COVID-19.
Corporate indebtedness interest expense increased $4.3 million, or 2.5%, primarily as a result of unrealized losses on interest rate swap contracts.
Diamond’s effective income tax rate of 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the effect of
certain foreign income includible in U.S. taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances applied to certain foreign losses and permanent book-tax
differences.

Gross Vacation Interests sales decreased by $404.2 million, or 46.7%, due to a decrease in tours of 168,410 resulting from lower arrivals and closures
of our sales centers due to COVID-19 partially offset by higher VPG of $935 driven primarily by an increase in close rates. The decrease in Vacation
Interest sales, net of $396.0 million, or 61.7%, also includes a decrease in the provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales of $8.2 million due to
lower gross Vacation Interests sales, which is partially offset by $45.0 million incremental provision attributable to higher expected defaults resulting from
economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other revenue decreased $33.0 million, or 43.7%, largely due to a $12.5 million decrease in insurance settlements received as a result of Hurricane
Irma as well as a decrease in other revenue primarily related to closing costs from gross Vacation Interests sales.
Vacation Interests cost of sales decreased $72.2 million, or 86.2%, primarily as a result of the decrease in Vacation Interests sales, net as well as a
reduction in cost-off rate resulting from current-period changes in estimates under the relative sales value method.
Advertising, sales and marketing expense decreased $205.2 million, or 46.9%, due to the decrease in gross
Vacation Interests sales.
Vacation Interests carrying costs, net increased by $64.7 million, or 404.4%, primarily due to lower rental revenues and usage of sales incentives,
partially offset by $76.6 million in lower costs related to these items, as a result of COVID-19 related resort closures.
Goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $103.4 million goodwill impairment charge related to the NA VISF reporting
unit as a result of forecasted declines in Diamond’s near-term profitability due to COVID-19.

Other impairments and write-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $14.1 million incremental allowance for credit losses related to the

General and administrative expenses decreased $24.8 million, or 13.8%, driven largely by a $12.5 million decrease in legal and professional costs
related to corporate development activities as well as a reduction in payroll and related costs due to employee furloughs and cost saving measures as a
result of COVID-19.
Diamond’s effective income tax rate of 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the effect of
certain foreign income includible in U.S. taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances applied to certain foreign losses and permanent book-tax
differences.

Consolidated Results
Total revenues increased $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily from a
combination of the following:
 
 
•
 $76.3 million of higher revenues in Vacation Interests sales and financing segment resulting from a $34.6 million increase in Vacation Interest
sales, net primarily attributable to an increase in tours and VPG partially offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible Vacation
Interests sales of $27.6 million resulting from higher gross Vacation Interests sales and increased defaults; an increase in consumer
financing interest revenue of $13.9 million primarily due to the increase in the balance of notes receivable portfolio as well as an increase in
contractual interest rates; and a $27.8 million increase in other revenue due to the $16.6 million of proceeds received under Diamond’s
business interruption insurance policies for resort closures as a result of Hurricane Irma and an increase of $11.2 million primarily due to
higher closing costs, transfer fees, and offsite stays on VOI promotional products.
 
123
Table of Contents
 
•
 $19.9 million higher revenues in the hospitality and management services segment primarily resulting from a $14.3 million reduction in
management and member services revenue from a one-time adjustment in 2018 and an increase in management and member services revenue
of $5.2 million primarily as a result of an increase in management fees related to direct reimbursable resort expenses in 2019.
Total operating costs and expenses decreased $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
primarily from a combination of the following:
 
 
•
 $47.6 million of lower operating costs and expenses in the Vacation Interests sales and financing segment primarily attributable to a
$76.0 million non-recurring impairment charge on the Acquired Notes recorded in 2018; a $6.9 million decrease in Vacation Interests carrying
costs, net driven mainly by a higher average daily rates and resort fees; partially offset by increased advertising, sales and marketing
expense of $19.7 million and increased Vacation Interests cost of sales of $12.6 million primarily due to higher gross Vacation Interests sales.
 
 
•
 $11.2 million of lower operating costs and expenses in the hospitality and management services segment primarily as a result of a
$17.5 million non-recurring goodwill impairment charge related to the European hospitality and management services (“EU H&MS”)
reporting unit recorded in 2018, which is partially offset by an increase in management and member services expense of $5.7 million as a
result of an increase in direct reimbursable resort expenses.
 
 
•
 $14.7 million of lower unallocated corporate costs, primarily attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expense of $21.1 million
mainly due to decrease in legal settlement costs largely related to the Apollo Merger which is partially offset by a $4.4 million increase on
depreciation and amortization expense which is primarily attributable to the Modern hotel which was acquired in April 2018.
Interest income decreased $10.5 million, as a result of $11.6 million of non-recurring interest income earned on loans from the Apollo Funds and
certain co-investors which were repaid in 2018.
Diamond recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the repricing of term loans under
its 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
Diamond’s effective income tax rate of (9.7%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the
recording of losses before provision for income taxes, the effect of foreign earnings includible in U.S taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances
applied to certain foreign tax losses and permanent book-tax differences.

2.7%, respectively, primarily as a result of a $14.3 million reduction in management and member services revenue related to a one-time adjustment for
certain cost savings and other reductions in reimbursable expenses in 2018. Direct reimbursable resort expenses were also higher in 2019, which drove an
increase in both management and member services revenue and management and services expense.

Diamond’s effective income tax rate of (9.7%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the
recording of losses before provision for income taxes, the effect of foreign earnings includible in U.S. taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances
applied to certain foreign tax losses and permanent book-tax differences.

Comparison of Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $82.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to steps taken to enhance liquidity, preserve cash, reduce expenditures in response to
COVID-19 impacts. These include measures such as reduction in both salaries and workforce and deferral of non-essential operating expenditures.
 
127
Table of Contents
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in property and equipment capital expenditures and partially offset by the sale of
undeveloped land that closed in January 2020.
Net cash used in financing activities increased by $256.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to decrease in net proceeds on securitization notes and Funding Facilities.
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 which is primarily due to steps taken to enhance liquidity, preserve cash, reduce expenditures and provide financial flexibility as a
result of the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. These include measures such as: reductions in both salaries and workforce, including voluntary
reductions in salaries by Diamond’s executive leadership team; unpaid employee furloughs; temporary elimination of 401(k) matching; and deferral of
all non-essential operating expenditures.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of undeveloped land which closed in January 2020.
Net cash used in financing activities increased by $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019. The increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds on securitization notes and Funding Facilities.
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018 which is primarily due to $16.6 million of proceeds received under our business interruption insurance policies for resort closures as a
result of Hurricane Irma in 2019 and cash used to defend and settle dissenting stockholder lawsuits raised subsequent to the Apollo Merger in 2018.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $222.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of cash paid to acquire the Modern in April 2018.
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the issuance of a principal amount of $200.0 million incremental term loans under the 2016
Senior Credit Facility for the acquisition of the Modern hotel in April 2018, partially by an offset by increase in net payments on securitization notes and
Funding Facilities in 2019.
VOI Inventory
During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, Diamond used cash totaling $15.1 million and $16.7 million, respectively, for acquisitions
of VOI inventory, including administrative costs of recovery. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, these amounts include $14.3 million
and $14.9 million, respectively, for the settlement of related party payables for acquisitions of VOI inventory pursuant to Diamond’s assignment and
recovery agreements (“IRAAs”). These related party payables have been settled against related party receivables balances where we have a legal right of
offset.
 
128
Table of Contents
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Diamond used cash totaling $32.6 million, $62.1 million and $72.6 million, respectively, for
acquisitions of VOI inventory, including administrative costs of recovery. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, these amounts include
$27.3 million, $42.2 million and $52.3 million, respectively, for the settlement of related party payables for acquisitions of VOI inventory pursuant to our
IRAAs. These related party payables have been settled against related party receivables balances where Diamond has a legal right of offset.
The acquisition (including recovery) and development of VOI inventory are key factors in maintaining inventory for future sales. The amounts of
inventory that may be purchased or developed in future periods may vary due to a wide variety of factors, some of which are not within Diamond’s
control; however, Diamond expects that significant future funds will be committed towards the purchase or development of VOI inventory. Such amounts
may or may not be consistent with cash used for these purposes in prior periods. Diamond believes that its VOI inventory on-hand as of March 31, 2021
is sufficient to support sales over the next year giving Diamond flexibility in when it would acquire additional VOI inventory to support sales beyond that
time frame.
Liquidity and Future Capital Requirements
The ability to monetize eligible Vacation Interest notes receivable has been critical to Diamond’s continued liquidity. Access to public asset-backed
security funding has slowed as COVID-19 negatively impacted the capital markets. The impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets may have an impact
on the availability of this type of funding in the near term and the near future.
As of March 31, 2021, Diamond had $541.5 million of availability under the Funding Facilities, subject to $187.1 million of eligible notes receivable,
and $92.0 million of availability under its Revolving Credit Facility.
In April 2021, Diamond completed a securitization transaction involving the issuance of $319.2 million of securities (the “DROT 2021-1 Notes”). The
DROT 2021-1 Notes proceeds were used to fund reserve accounts, pay costs associated with the transaction, and repaid amounts outstanding of
$134.1 million in principal and accrued interest under the Funding Facilities, with the remaining cash of $93.3 million transferred to Diamond for general
corporate purposes.
Diamond believes that its current net cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and its existing non-recourse securitizations and
Funding Facilities provide it with sufficient liquidity to meet its ongoing cash needs for the near future. Based on Diamond’s current estimates regarding
the magnitude and length of the disruptions to its business, it does not anticipate these disruptions will impact its ability to meet its obligations when due
or its ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants for at least the next 12 months.
The ultimate magnitude and length time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This uncertainty will require
Diamond’s management team to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions. Accordingly,
Diamond’s estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the company’s results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.
Indebtedness
As of March 31, 2021, Diamond had $2.0 billion of recourse indebtedness (excluding debt issuance costs), which included $862.8 million of term
loans under the Senior Facilities, $500.0 million of the First Lien Notes, and $591.0 million of the Senior Notes. Diamond also had $569.5 million of non-
recourse indebtedness of our special-purpose subsidiaries (excluding debt issuance costs) in connection with its securitization program and Funding
Facilities.
Diamond’s indebtedness could limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, strategic
initiatives or other purposes. In addition, the Senior Facilities and the
 
129
Table of Contents
indentures governing the Existing Diamond Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit its ability to engage in activities that may be in its long-term
best interest.
Securitization notes and Funding Facilities, net. Diamond monetizes a substantial portion of the Vacation Interests notes receivable it generates
through asset-backed bank Funding Facilities and periodically accesses the capital markets by issuing asset-backed securities through its securitization
program. Diamond generally expects to securitize its Vacation Interests notes receivable at least once a year. The asset-backed facilities are non-recourse.
Diamond has depended on the availability of credit to finance the consumer loans that it provides to its customers for the purchase of their VOIs.
Accordingly, the availability of financing for the sale or pledge of these receivables to generate liquidity is a critical factor in its ability to meet its short-
term and long-term cash needs. Diamond has historically relied upon its ability to monetize receivables in the securitization market in order to generate
liquidity and create capacity in its Funding Facilities. Any disruption to the asset-backed securities market or Diamond’s ability to access such markets
could adversely impact Diamond’s ability to obtain such financings.
As noted previously, Diamond had $541.5 million available under the Funding Facilities as of March 31, 2021, which has reduced its reliance on the
securitizations market.
As of March 31, 2021, the Funding Facilities had commitment amounts ranging from $125.0 million to $200.0 million. The advance rate for the
Vacation Interests notes receivable varies based on the characteristics of the eligible notes receivable with an overall limit range of 80% to 86%.
Borrowings under the Funding Facilities bear variable interest rates of 1.75% to 3.00% plus LIBOR and are subject to non-use fees. The facilities generally
have a four-year maturity with a two- to three-year advance period and one- to two-year amortization period. Additionally, the facilities contain customary
performance triggers and financial covenants. The inability to meet these triggers and financial covenants could impact the monthly residual cash
Diamond receives, limit its ability to draw on one or more of the Funding Facilities and potentially limit its ability to secure additional borrowings under
the Funding Facilities. Diamond was in compliance with all financial covenants as of March 31, 2021.
In general, the cost of financing related to Diamond’s securitization notes and Funding Facilities fluctuates consistent with macroeconomic
conditions and is not directly impacted by the delinquency or default rates of its VOI consumer loans. Delinquency and default rates generally are
relevant factors to be considered when negotiating the credit enhancement terms of Diamond’s securitization notes and Funding Facilities, such as
advance rates. Diamond’s weighted average effective interest rate on its securitization notes and Funding Facilities was 3.4% as of both March 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Diamond’s ability to secure short-term and long-term financing in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including its future profitability, the
performance of its consumer loan receivable portfolio, its relative levels of debt and equity, the credit ratings of its corporate indebtedness and
securitization notes and Funding Facilities, net and the overall condition of the credit and securitization markets. There can be no assurances that any
such financing will be available to Diamond. If Diamond is unable to secure short-term and long-term financing in the future or if cash flows from
operations are less than expected, Diamond’s liquidity and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected, it may be required to curtail our sales
and marketing operations, and it may not be able to implement its growth strategy.
Diamond monitors the capital markets and its capital structure and makes changes from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility,
preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. From time to time Diamond may elect to continue to repurchase additional amounts of
its outstanding debt, including repurchases of Senior Notes or First Lien Notes, for cash through open market repurchases or privately negotiated
transactions with certain of its debt holders, although there is no assurance it will do so.

Facilities.
Deferred Taxes
As of the tax period ended December 31, 2020, Diamond had $500.5 million of unused federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) carry-forwards,
$300.8 million of unused state NOLs and $150.0 million of foreign NOLs with expiration dates from 2020 through 2038 (except for certain foreign NOLs that
do not expire) that may be applied against future taxable income, subject to certain limitations. As of March 31, 2021, there have been no material changes
to Diamond’s deferred taxes from December 31, 2020.
Diamond expects the rate at which it pays cash taxes to be less than the statutory tax rate for the foreseeable future. See “Note 18—Income
Taxes” to the audited consolidated financial statements of Diamond included elsewhere in this proxy statement for additional information related to
income tax matters.
Commitments and Contingencies

This line contains purchase obligations as well as estimated payments due under a management consulting agreement. See “Note 7—Transactions with Related Parties” to
Diamond’s consolidated financial statements included with this proxy statement for details related to this agreement. The amounts included above are based upon the
minimum annual fee of $5.0 million for the term of the agreement. The variable aspect of the agreement is not determinable at this time, and is based upon the greater
of $5.0 million or 2% of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, for each annual period. The amounts above also include fees due during the renewal
periods.
Diamond’s accrued liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets included with this proxy statement include unrecognized tax benefits. As of
December 31, 2020, Diamond had unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million. At this time, Diamond is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the
timing of payments, if any, in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the contractual
obligations table above.

statements included with this proxy statement for Diamond’s geographic segment information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of Diamond’s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on its consolidated
financial statements. To prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Diamond must make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements. Diamond regularly evaluates these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas it
considers to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on its results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. By their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from
our estimates. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to Diamond’s audited consolidated financial statements included with this
proxy statement for further detail on these critical accounting policies as well as the discussion that follows.
Vacation Interests Sales, Net—Diamond sells VOIs through its sales centers which are primarily located in North America. Typical contracts
include the sale of points-based VOIs, certain sales incentives in the form of additional points for use over a specified period of time, and membership in
its points-based vacation programs, each of which represents separate and distinct performance obligations for which consideration is allocated based
on the estimated stand-alone selling price of sales incentives and membership dues. Diamond estimates stand-alone selling price based on historical
information and allocate the remainder of the transaction price to the sale of points-based VOIs due to the variability in observable historical prices for
traditional VOI sales.
Diamond generally offers financing of up to 90% of the purchase price of its VOI contracts with a typical term of 10 years, for which the financed
amount represents variable consideration. Variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value method to the extent that it is probable a
significant reversal is not expected to occur. Diamond estimates the expected value to be collected based on historical default rates and recognizes
revenue net of amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Variable consideration that has not been included in the transaction price is presented as an
allowance on Vacation Interests notes receivable. Diamond analyzes its allowance for loan and contract losses quarterly and make adjustments based on
current trends in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, the customer’s credit score and other criteria, if necessary. See “Note 6—Vacation Interests
Notes Receivable and Allowance” to Diamond’s audited financial statements included with this proxy statement for further detail.
Diamond recognizes revenue related to its points-based VOIs when control of the points passes to the customer, which generally occurs after the
expiration of the applicable statutory rescission period. For payment plans that restrict the use of points-based VOI products until a number of payments
have been made, Diamond recognizes revenue after the use restrictions have been lifted, which typically occurs after 90 days of the sale. Revenue related
to sales incentives, which typically provides the customer with the right to reserve additional vacation stays over the average 18 month term of the
incentive, is recognized based on usage. Diamond estimates breakage on incentives based on historical data and recognize estimated breakage
proportionately to when other customers use their incentives. Revenue related to membership dues for the Clubs are included in the hospitality and
management services segment as described below. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to Diamond’s audited consolidated
financial statements with this proxy statement for additional information.
 
132
Table of Contents
Allowance for Vacation Interests Notes Receivable—Diamond uses significant estimates to record a provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests
notes receivable. This provision is calculated as projected gross losses for originated Vacation Interests notes receivable, not taking into account
estimated VOI recoveries. Diamond applies historical default percentages to the Vacation Interests notes receivable population and evaluates other
factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, defaults and the age of past due amounts to analyze the adequacy of the allowance. Any changes
to the assumptions used in calculating the allowance could result in a significantly different estimate of uncollectible Vacation Interests notes receivable.
If actual Vacation Interests notes receivable losses differ materially from these estimates, Diamond’s future results of operations may be adversely
impacted.
Vacation Interests Cost of Sales—Diamond applies the relative sales value method for recording cost of sales. Under the relative sales value
method, cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales percentage ratio of total estimated development cost to total
estimated VOI revenue, including estimated future revenue and incorporating factors such as changes in prices and the recovery of VOIs generally as a
result of contract receivable defaults. The effect of such changes in estimates under the relative sales value method is accounted for on a retrospective
basis through corresponding current-period adjustments to inventory and cost of sales. Accordingly, small changes in any of the numerous estimates in
the model can have a significant financial statement impact due to the retroactive nature of any required adjustments.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets—Diamond’s most significant long-lived assets are goodwill and other intangible assets.
Diamond does not amortize goodwill, but rather evaluates goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if
events or circumstances indicate that it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying amount.
Diamond reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less
than its net book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset.
There are several estimates inherent in evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are,
by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of capitalization rates and the
discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions. As of
December 31, 2020, Diamond had goodwill of $881.6 million and definite-lived intangible assets of $1,013.1 million.
If future results of operations and cash flows are not at sufficient levels, there is a possibility that Diamond may have to record impairments of
goodwill and other intangible assets in the future, which could be material to its consolidated financial statements. See also “Note 12—Goodwill” and
“Note 13—Other Intangible Assets, net” to Diamond’s audited consolidated financial statements included with this proxy statement.
Income Taxes—Diamond reduces the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is
“more-likely-than-not” that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed
periodically based on a “more-likely-than-not” realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity
of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carry
forward periods, Diamond’s experience with operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. The above
factors can be highly subjective, and as such, actual results may differ from its estimates.

Diamond assesses uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. Diamond considers
many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately
anticipate actual outcomes. See “Note 18—Income Taxes” to Diamond’s consolidated financial statements included with this proxy statement for
additional information related to income tax related matters.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” to Diamond’s audited consolidated
financial statements included with this proxy statement for a discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements that impact us.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Inflation. Inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on Diamond’s revenues and net income (loss) during any of its three most
recent fiscal years; however, to the extent inflationary trends affect short-term interest rates, a portion of its debt service costs, as well as the rates
Diamond charges on its consumer loans, may be affected.
Interest Rate Risk. Diamond is exposed to interest rate risk through its variable rate indebtedness, including the Funding Facilities and the Senior
Facilities. The U.S. Federal Reserve has recently increased interest rates and has indicated there may be future interest rate increases. In addition,
Diamond’s variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate and may be hedged with LIBOR-based
interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent international and regulatory guidance and may be phased out as an interest rate benchmark as of
the year ending 2021, although there is no definitive information regarding the future use of LIBOR or any particular replacement rate. Any such change
may have an adverse effect on the cost of Diamond’s variable rate indebtedness or interest rate derivatives.
Diamond has attempted to manage its interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. Diamond does not hold or issue
financial instruments for trading purposes and does not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. To manage
exposure to counterparty credit risk in interest rate swap and cap agreements, at times Diamond enters into agreements with highly-rated institutions that
can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. See “Note 20— Fair Value Measurements” to Diamond’s audited consolidated
financial statements included with this proxy statement.
To the extent Diamond assumes additional variable rate indebtedness in the future, any increase in interest rates beyond amounts covered under
any corresponding derivative financial instruments, particularly if sustained, could have an adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and
financial position. Diamond cannot assure that any hedging transactions it enters into will adequately mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate
increases or that counterparties in those transactions will honor their obligations.
Additionally, Diamond derives net interest margin from its consumer financing activities to the extent the interest rates it charges its customers who
finance their purchases of VOIs exceed the variable interest rates it pays to its lenders. Net interest margin is calculated as the difference between
consumer financing interest revenue and consumer financing interest expense. Because Diamond’s Vacation Interests notes receivable generally bear
interest at fixed rates, future increases in interest rates may result in a decline in Diamond’s net interest margin.
As of December 31, 2020, 40.0% of Diamond’s borrowings, or $1,020.3 million, bore interest at variable rates. However, all of Diamond’s variable-rate
borrowings require a minimal interest rate floor when LIBOR is below certain levels. Assuming the level of variable-rate borrowings outstanding at
December 31, 2020, and assuming a one percentage point increase in the 2020 average interest rate payable on these borrowings, Diamond estimates that
its interest expense would have increased and pre-tax income would have decreased by $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Table of Contents
Foreign Currency Translation Risk. In addition to our operations throughout the U.S., Diamond conducts operations in international markets from
which it receives, at least in part, revenues in foreign currencies. Because Diamond’s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value
of the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Mexican Peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar have had, and will continue to have, an effect, which may be
significant, on its reported financial results.
A decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which Diamond receives revenues, including the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Mexican
Peso and Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar will tend to reduce its reported revenues and expenses, while an increase in the value of any such
foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to increase its reported revenues and expenses; however the impacts on Diamond’s revenues and
expenses may not always be equivalent. Variations in exchange rates could affect the comparability of Diamond’s financial results between financial
periods; however, since sales of Vacation Interests transacted in U.S. dollars have historically accounted for more than 90% of Diamond’s consolidated
Vacation Interests sales revenue, and management and member services revenue is similarly concentrated, Diamond does not expect the variations in

HGV AND DIAMOND
On March 10, 2021, HGV, Diamond and Diamond’s stockholders entered into a merger agreement, under which HGV will combine with Diamond
through a series of business combinations. Diamond will be an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HGV.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information includes the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of
HGV and Diamond for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, combine the historical consolidated statements of
operations of HGV and Diamond, giving effect to the merger and the related financing as if it had been completed on January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2021, combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of HGV and Diamond, giving effect
to the merger as if it had been completed on March 31, 2021.
The historical consolidated financial statements of Diamond have been adjusted to reflect certain reclassifications in order to align financial
statement presentation.
The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information, estimates and assumptions that HGV’s management believes
are reasonable as of the date hereof. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for informational purposes only, is not intended to represent
or to be indicative of actual results of operations or financial position of HGV or Diamond had the merger been completed on the dates assumed, and
should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those
reflected in the pro forma statement of operations for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to
prepare the pro forma statements of operations and actual amounts.
In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with:
 
 
•
 HGV’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which are included in
this proxy statement; and
 
 
•
 Diamond’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which are included in
this proxy statement.
The historical financial statements have been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to give
effect to pro forma events that are applicable to business combination accounting as required under generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (GAAP). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information contained herein does not include integration costs or
benefits from synergies that may result from the merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance
with GAAP, with HGV considered the acquirer of Diamond. Accordingly, consideration paid or exchanged by HGV to complete the merger with Diamond
will generally be allocated to assets and liabilities of Diamond based on their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the merger. The
acquisition method of accounting is dependent upon certain valuation assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Diamond based on management’s best estimates of fair value. The actual purchase price allocation may
vary based on final analyses of the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and changes in the acquired balances from operations up to
through the actual merger date. In addition, the value of the consideration paid or exchanged by HGV to complete the merger will be determined based on
the trading price of HGV common stock at the time of completion of the merger. These changes may result in material adjustments.
Some amounts do not match the Diamond historical financial statements due to rounding (refer to Note 4).

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(in millions, except share and per share data)
 
1.
Description of the Merger and Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
On March 10, 2021, HGV and Diamond entered into the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each existing share of Diamond
common stock issued and outstanding will be cancelled and converted into and exchanged for the right to receive a number of shares of common stock of
HGV (and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares) calculated in the manner set forth in the merger agreement.
Certain reclassifications have been made in order to align historical presentation of Diamond to HGV. Refer to Note 4 for these reclassification
adjustments.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and HGV is considered the
accounting acquirer. The acquisition method of accounting, based on ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), uses the fair value concepts
defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”). Fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible the application of
reasonable judgment could result in alternative estimates using the same facts and circumstances. ASC 805 requires that assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination be recognized at fair value as of the merger date, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. Refer to Note
3.
The estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the date of acquisition are based on estimates and assumptions of HGV. HGV
will continue to finalize the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which will be recorded upon (and, if necessary, after) the closing of
the merger. The fair value allocation consists of preliminary estimates and analyses and is subject to change upon the finalization of the valuation
analyses, and that change may be material.
For the purposes of preparing the pro forma financial statements, HGV has conducted a preliminary review of Diamond’s accounting policies to identify
significant differences. Upon consummation of the merger, HGV will conduct an additional review of Diamond’s accounting policies to determine if
differences in accounting policies or financial statement classification exist that may require adjustments to or reclassification of Diamond’s results of
operations, assets or liabilities to conform to HGV’s accounting policies and classifications. As a result of that review, differences may be identified that,
when conformed, could have a material impact on the pro forma financial statements.

HGV shares issued is based on a fixed Base Purchase Price quantity of shares, reduced by certain closing leakage and excluded liabilities as defined
in the merger agreement.
(2)
Stock price is the closing price of HGV stock on June 1, 2021.
(3)
If the stock price were to increase or decrease by 10%, the stock purchase price would change by $163 million.
(4)
This reflects the balance of Diamond’s debt to be repaid as of March 31, 2021, as well as $9 million of accrued interest. Refer to Note 5 below for
more information about debt repayment.

Preliminary Fair Values of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
The following table presents our preliminary estimates of fair values of the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed (in millions) as of
March 31, 2021(1). Our preliminary estimates are based on the information that was available as of the date of this filing. As discussed in Note 1 herein,
the preliminary estimated allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes. These changes will primarily relate to the
allocation of consideration transferred and the fair value assigned to all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and identified. The final
purchase price and goodwill could differ significantly from the current estimate, which could materially impact the pro forma financial statements.

Financing
In connection with the merger, HGV obtained a financing commitment to provide a new $1.3 billion seven-year senior secured term loan facility, a new
$675 million senior unsecured bridge loan facility, and “back-stop” commitments to amend its existing revolving credit facility to an $800 million capacity.
HGV also issued $850 million senior unsecured notes on June 4, 2021 and recently priced $500 million senior unsecured notes in a second debt offering
(together with the term facility, the amended revolving facility, and the June 4, 2021 note issuance, the “financing”). HGV terminated its committed bridge
facility with its lenders following the issuance of the $850 million senior unsecured notes. The financing is depicted in the pro forma statement of
operations as outstanding for the entire period.
HGV intends to repay Diamond’s senior facilities and first lien notes at closing and use the proceeds from the second debt offering to repay Diamond’s
senior notes. This repayment is included in consideration transferred in Note 2. HGV intends to assume $26 million in other Diamond indebtedness; this
debt is recognized at its fair value as part of the liabilities assumed in Note 3, for which no preliminary fair value adjustment was required.
In addition, using the financing described above, HGV intends to pay down HGV’s existing revolver, term loan, and senior notes.

Timeshare financing receivables are in scope of ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326” or “CECL”) which
includes guidance on purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (“PCD”). CECL requires recognition of an allowance at the
closing of the merger for any purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans from the Diamond loan portfolio. CECL also requires an
additional allowance for non-PCD loans from the Diamond portfolio which will be recognized through the income statement of HGV
following the closing of the merger. HGV is continuing to evaluate the loan detail of the acquired Diamond timeshare financing
receivables as well as the change in credit environment and credit quality since origination of those assets; this evaluation impacts
the determination of which acquired timeshare financing receivables have experienced credit deterioration and are considered PCD.
The impact of this analysis on our pro forma financial statements could be material.

Record an increase to deferred tax liabilities based on the blended foreign, federal, and state statutory rate of approximately 24%
multiplied by the fair value adjustments related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Deferred taxes relating to goodwill for
prior Diamond acquisitions and repaid debt have also been removed from the pro forma financial statements. These adjustments are
based on estimates of the fair value of Diamond’s assets to be acquired, liabilities to be assumed, and the related purchase price
allocations. These estimates are subject to further review by management of HGV and Diamond, which may result in material
adjustments to deferred taxes with an offsetting adjustment to goodwill.

interest expense for the term facility and the amended revolving facility is based on the variable interest rates specified in the Commitment
Letter (Exhibit 10.1 to Form 8-K dated March 11, 2020) and for the notes is based on the fixed interest rate received under the debt offering.
The weighted average interest rate for pro forma purposes on the notes, term facility and amended revolving facility is 4.15%. A change in
the interest rate by 1/8% (12.5 basis points) is not expected to be material. Finally, in connection with the bridge loan, an increase in interest
expense was recognized on consummation of the transaction related to loan commitment and funding fees, as such amounts will still be
incurred by HGV, despite the bridge loan facility being terminated.

As discussed in this proxy statement, our stockholders are being asked to consider and vote on the proposal to issue shares of our common stock
to Diamond stockholders under the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We expect the shares to be issued
to Diamond stockholders under the merger agreement to represent approximately 28% of our total shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis
immediately following consummation of the merger.
You should carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the proposal to issue shares of our common
stock to Diamond stockholders under the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast and entitled to vote on the stock issuance proposal is required for approval of the
stock issuance proposal.
Our board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and determined that the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of shares of common stock to Diamond stockholders under the
merger agreement, are advisable and in the best interests of HGV and its stockholders. Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously recommends
that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the stock issuance proposal.

Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,PROPOSAL NUMBER 2: COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"PROPOSAL NUMBER 2: COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, we are seeking a non-binding, advisory shareholder approval of the
compensation of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger—
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers—Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 76. This proposal and related disclosure are required notwithstanding the fact that, as previously disclosed, other
than the previously announced separation involving our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to terminate any of our
other named executive officers in connection with the merger. Accordingly, we do not expect to make any such payments to our named executive officers
other than to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer in connection with our previously announced separation.
Therefore, we are asking holders of our common stock to vote “FOR” the adoption of the following resolution, on a non-binding advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to the HGV named executive officers, in connection with the merger,
and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant
to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Compensation for Our
Named Executive Officers —Golden Parachute Compensation” are hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the votes on the stock issuance proposal and the adjournment
proposal. Accordingly, if you are a holder of our common stock, you may vote to approve the stock issuance proposal and/or the adjournment proposal
and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. The approval of the compensation proposal by holders of our common stock is not a
condition to the completion of the merger. If the merger is completed and only if our named executive officers (other than our Executive Vice President and
Chief Marketing Officer) are terminated in a manner that entitles them to the merger-related compensation, such compensation will be payable in
accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if holders of our common stock fail to approve this advisory vote
regarding merger-related compensation.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the compensation proposal. However, as noted
above, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to terminate any of our executive officers in
connection with the merger. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any change in control payments, accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to be
triggered by the merger for our other named executive officers.

The special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies to obtain
additional votes in favor of the stock issuance proposal.
If, at the special meeting, the number of shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy and voting in favor of the stock issuance
proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal, we intend to move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable our board of directors to solicit
additional proxies for approval of the stock issuance proposal.
In the adjournment proposal, we are asking our stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by our board of directors to vote in
favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to vote to adjourn the special meeting to another time and
place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, if necessary or appropriate. If our stockholders approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,
we could adjourn the special meeting (and any adjourned session of the special meeting) and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies,
including the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders who have previously voted.
The approval of the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of the stockholders of a majority in voting
power present if a quorum is not present, or, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and
annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable,
addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for
stockholders and cost savings for companies.
We and any banks and brokerage firms that hold shares of our common stock have delivered only one proxy statement to multiple stockholders
who share an address unless one or more of the stockholders has provided contrary instructions. We will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a
separate copy of the proxy statement to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. An HGV
stockholder who wishes to receive a separate copy of the proxy statement, now or in the future, may obtain one, without charge, by addressing a request
to Investor Relations, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 400, Orlando, Florida 32839, by email to IR@hgv.com, or by
calling (407) 613-3100. You may also obtain a copy of the proxy statement from the investor relations page on HGV’s website at investors.hgv.com. HGV
stockholders of record sharing an address who are receiving multiple copies of proxy materials and annual reports or notices and wish to receive a single
copy of such materials in the future should submit their request by contacting us in the same manner. If you are the beneficial owner, but not the record
holder, of our common stock and wish to receive only one copy of the proxy materials and annual reports or notices in the future, you will need to contact

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Dakota Holdings, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dakota Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements and the schedules listed in the Index to the Financial Statements.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dakota Holdings,
Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to adoption of Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases, using the modified retrospective method. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Note 1—Business, Background and Basis of Presentation
Business and Background
Dakota Holdings, Inc., (“Dakota” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on June 27, 2016 by certain investment funds
affiliated with or managed by Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Apollo”), including Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., along with
their parallel investment funds (the “Apollo Funds”) and certain co-investors (Reverence Capital Partners, L.P., or “Reverence”). Dakota and its
subsidiaries were established to complete the acquisition of Diamond Resorts International, Inc. (“DRII”). DRII is a holding company, the principal asset
of which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in its subsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating
subsidiary that has historically conducted the business described below.
Prior to the acquisition of DRII on September 2, 2016 (the “Apollo Merger”), Dakota had no operations or activity other than acquisition related
costs. Subsequent to the Apollo Merger, Dakota became the holding company and derives all of its operating income and cash flows from DRII and its
subsidiaries. Other than (i) the acquisition of the equity securities of DRII and the payment of transaction costs at the closing of the Apollo Merger and
(ii) the issuance of Dakota Holdings common shares to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company; there has been no significant
activity related to DRII’s parent entities in the consolidated financial statements. See “Schedule I—Condensed Financial Information of Parent
Company” for the financial information of DRII’s parent entities.
The Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in the hospitality and vacation ownership industry, with a worldwide resort network of global
vacation destinations located around the world, including the continental United States (“U.S.”), Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central
America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. The Company’s portfolio consists of 110 resort properties (the “Portfolio
Properties”) that the Company manages, are included in one of the Diamond Collections or are Diamond branded resorts in which we own inventory, as
well as 229 affiliated resorts and hotels, which the Company does not manage and which do not carry the Company’s brand, but are a part of the
Company’s network and, through THE Club® and other Club offerings (the “Clubs”), are available for its members to use as vacation destinations.
The Company’s operations consist of two interrelated businesses: (i) vacation interests (“VOIs” or “Vacation Interests”) sales and financing, which
includes marketing and sales of VOIs and consumer financing for purchasers of the Company’s VOIs; and (ii) hospitality and management services,
which includes operations related to the management of the homeowners associations (the “VOAs”) for resort properties and single- and multi-resort
trusts (collectively, the “Diamond Collections”), operations of the Clubs, operation of certain resort amenities and the provision of other hospitality and
management services.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020 the World Health Organization designated recent coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a global pandemic. The results of operations for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include impacts related to COVID-19 which have had a negative impact on the Company and the travel and
hospitality industry. In response to social distancing directives and significant restrictions on travel caused by COVID-19, the Company initially closed
most of its resorts and suspended its onsite sales and marketing operations. The Company has taken several steps to enhance liquidity, preserve cash,
reduce expenditures and provide financial flexibility, and the Company’s management is continuing to assess the evolving situation and will take actions
as appropriate. These include measures such as: reductions in both salaries and workforce, including voluntary reductions in salaries by our executive
leadership team; unpaid employee furloughs; temporary elimination of 401(k) matching; and deferral of all non-essential operating and capital
expenditures.

Beginning in May 2020, the Company saw demand return for reservations, which suggests that demand to vacation continues to be strong despite
economic uncertainty driven by COVID-19. As governmental authorities began to lift restrictions, the Company worked with health experts in
establishing reopening safety protocols. The Company’s management implemented and trained team members on the “Diamond Standard of Clean.”
Undertaking a phased approach since late May 2020, the Company has re-opened the majority of its Portfolio Properties and onsite sales centers, albeit at
reduced capacity levels and revenue has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. Certain Club offerings and member benefits, such as cruise itineraries,
remain unavailable. The Company continues to monitor travel restrictions and prioritize the safety of its customers and employees. This involves a
continuous assessment of whether the closure of resorts is necessary due to potential tightening of government restrictions and the potential resurgence
of coronavirus cases.
Based on the Company’s current estimates regarding the magnitude and length of the disruptions to business, the Company does not anticipate
these disruptions will impact our ability to meet our obligations when due or our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants for at least the
next 12 months. However, the ultimate magnitude and length of time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This
uncertainty will require the Company to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions.
Accordingly, our estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the Company’s results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.
Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which the
Company has a controlling financial interest, including certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”). When evaluating an entity for consolidation, the
Company determines if the entity in which it holds a variable interest is a VIE. Management considers both quantitative and qualitative factors, including
items such as the economics, design and control of the entity. If the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is consolidated.
All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications have been
applied consistently to the periods presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net (loss) income or total assets and liabilities.
Use of Estimates—The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Vacation Interests Sales, net—Vacation Interests sales consist of revenue from the sale of points, which can be utilized for vacations at any of the
resorts in the Company’s network for varying lengths of stay. The Company sells VOIs through its sales centers which are primarily located in North
America. Typical contracts include the sale of points-based VOIs, certain sales incentives in the form of additional points for use over a specified period
of time, and membership in the Company’s points-based vacation Clubs, each of which represents separate and distinct performance obligations for
which consideration is allocated based on the estimated stand-alone selling price of sales incentives and membership dues. The Company estimates
stand-alone
 
F-8

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
selling price based on historical information, including expected breakage in contracts with multiple performance obligations, and allocates the remainder
of the transaction price to the sale of points-based VOIs due to the variability in observable historical prices for traditional VOI sales.
The Company generally offers financing of up to 90% of the purchase price of its VOI contracts with a typical term of 10 years, for which the
financed amount represents variable consideration. Variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value method to the extent that it is
probable a significant reversal is not expected to occur. The Company estimates the expected value to be collected based on historical default rates and
recognizes revenue net of amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Variable consideration that has not been included in the transaction price is presented as
an allowance on Vacation Interests notes receivable. The Company analyzes its allowance for loan and contract losses quarterly and makes adjustments
based on current trends in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, the customer’s credit score and other criteria, if necessary. See “Note 6—Vacation
Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance” for further detail.
The Company recognizes revenue related to its points-based VOIs when control of the points passes to the customer, which generally occurs after
the expiration of the applicable statutory rescission period. For payment plans that restrict the use of points-based VOI products until a number of
payments have been made, the Company recognizes revenue after the use restrictions have been lifted, which typically occurs after 90 days of the sale.
Management and Member Services Revenue—Management and member services revenue includes resort management fees charged to the VOAs
and the members associations of the Diamond Collections (the “Collection Associations”), revenues from the Company’s operation of the Clubs and
revenues from other ancillary services. These revenues are recorded and recognized as follows:
 
 
i.
The Company’s management contracts typically have initial terms of three to ten years, with automatic renewals. The Company earns
management fee revenue based upon the terms of the Company’s management agreements with the VOAs and Collection Associations.
Management fees are determined on a cost-plus basis, for which costs are reimbursed based on an amount established annually by the
respective VOA’s or Collections Associations. Management fees are billed monthly and the Company reduces management fees for
amounts it has paid to VOAs or Collections Associations for maintenance fees on Company-owned VOIs. The Company provides
management services to the VOAs and Collections Associations over the duration of the arrangement which includes a number of activities
related to the operations and maintenance of the resorts and associations. These services are substantially consistent from day to day, and
therefore represent a series of distinct goods or services that are considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is
recognized ratably over time as services are performed.
 
 
  
Cost reimbursements, such as payroll costs for Company employees who perform services under the management agreements, and the cost
of property and liability insurance allocated by the Company to the VOAs and Collection Associations, are recorded on a gross basis in
management and member services revenue and management and member services expense. Reimbursed corporate costs allocated to the
VOAs and Collections are presented on a gross basis as management and member services revenue with the related expenses recorded
primarily in management and member services expense and general and administrative expense. Management and member services revenue
and expenses related to the Company’s annual maintenance fee assessments (for VOIs owned by the Company) are presented net in
Vacation interests carrying cost, net.
 
 
ii.
Club membership represents a series of distinct goods or services, or days of member services for which each day is distinct, and is
accounted for as a single performance obligation. The stand-alone

selling price is directly observable as the stated amount for membership dues invoiced by the Company and is recognized ratably over time.
Membership contracts typically have a term of one year with payment due at the beginning of the year. Fees related to other ancillary
services are recognized at the time when the member elects to purchase the additional services and the services have been provided.
 
 
iii.
The Company also earns revenue related to the provision of ancillary services at certain resorts, and these revenues are recognized when
goods have been provided or services have been rendered.
Interest Revenue—The Company’s interest revenue consists primarily of interest earned on consumer loans, and is accrued based on the
contractual provisions of the loan documents, which is suspended at the earlier of (i) the customer’s account becoming over 90 days delinquent, or
(ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure proceedings. If payments are received while a consumer loan is considered delinquent, interest is
recognized on a cash basis. Interest accrual resumes once a customer has brought the account current.
Other Revenue—Other revenue includes items such as collection fees paid by VOAs and Collections Associations, closing costs paid by
purchasers on sales of VOIs, promotional VOI products for which the performance obligation is satisfied when a customer makes a reservation at an
affiliate resort, late/impound fees assessed on consumer loans, and loan servicing fees earned for servicing third party portfolios.
Vacation Interests Cost of Sales—The Company applies the relative sales value method for relieving VOI inventory and recording the related cost
of sales, under which cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales percentage ratio of total estimated cost to total
estimated VOI revenue, including estimated future revenue and incorporating factors such as changes in prices and the recovery of VOIs. The effect of
such changes in estimates under the relative sales value method is accounted for on a retrospective basis through corresponding current-period
adjustments to inventory and cost of sales. See also “Unsold Vacation Interests” below.
Advertising, Sales and Marketing Costs—Advertising, sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred, except for deferred costs directly
related to VOI sales that are not eligible for revenue recognition. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, advertising expense recognized
was $10.1 million, $12.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively.
Vacation Interests Carrying Cost, net—Vacation Interests carrying cost, net includes the maintenance fees and assessments paid or payable to the
VOAs and the Collection Associations for VOIs owned by the Company, certain amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Company’s inventory recovery
and assignment agreements with the VOAs and Diamond Collections for the recapture of VOIs (“IRAAs”).
To offset the Company’s Vacation Interests carrying costs, the Company rents VOIs for which it has rights to use to third parties on a short-term
basis, and also generates revenue on sales incentives, including sales of sampler programs (“Sampler Packages”), which allow prospective owners to
stay at a resort property on a trial basis. Revenue and the associated expenses for incentives is recognized as a net reduction to Vacation Interests
carrying costs and is based on usage. The Company estimates breakage based on historical data and recognizes estimated breakage proportionately to
when other customers use their incentives. Sales incentives and Sampler packages provide the customer with the right to reserve vacation stays typically
over an average 18 month period. The Company has extended the term for points expiring in 2020 for up to 12 months due to travel restrictions caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Management and Member Services Expense—Management and member services expense includes: (i) certain costs associated with the provision
of services under the management agreements with the VOAs and
 
F-10
Table of Contents
DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
Collection Associations; (ii) the costs associated with the operation of the Clubs (including costs incurred for call centers, membership fees paid to a
third-party exchange company on behalf of members of the Clubs, as applicable, and administrative expenses); and (iii) the costs to provide other
ancillary services at certain resort locations.
Loan Portfolio Expense—Loan portfolio expense includes payroll and administrative costs of finance operations and credit card processing fees,
as well as in-house collections performed on behalf of the VOAs. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Interest Expense—Interest expense related to the Company’s securitizations and Funding Facilities is classified as consumer financing interest
expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Interest expense related to corporate debt is classified as corporate
indebtedness interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See “Note 16—Borrowings” for the definition of
Funding Facilities.
Stock-based Compensation Expense—The Company measures stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records the
related expense in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See “Note 21—Stock-Based Compensation” for further detail on
the Company’s stock-based compensation.
Income Taxes—The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which the
Company operates. The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are
required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is “more-likely-than-not” that such assets will not be realized.
Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on a “more-likely-than-not” realization
threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future
profitability, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, the Company’s experience with
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
The Company records a deferred tax asset for its net operating losses, a portion of which the use thereof is subject to limitations. As a result of
uncertainties regarding the Company’s ability to utilize such net operating loss carry-forwards, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against the
deferred tax assets attributable to these net operating losses.
The Company assesses uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is
to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is “more-likely-than-not” that the position will
be sustained on examination, based solely on the technical merits. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than
50% likely of being sustained on examination. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the Company’s tax positions and tax
benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
Cash and Cash Equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds, and all highly-liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity date of three months or less.
Cash in Escrow and Restricted Cash—Cash in escrow consists of deposits received on sales of VOIs that are held in escrow until the legal
rescission period has expired. Restricted cash consists primarily of cash held for
 
F-11
Table of Contents
DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
the benefit of the note holders including the reserve and cash collections on certain Vacation Interests notes receivable that secure collateralized notes.
Restricted cash also includes certain amounts collected on behalf of VOAs and deposits related to Vacation Interests notes receivable servicing
agreements.
Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Related Allowance—Vacation Interests notes receivable are recorded net of (i) deferred costs; (ii) any
discount or premium; and (iii) the related allowance for losses. Origination costs incurred in connection with providing financing for VOIs are capitalized
and amortized over the average life of Vacation Interests notes receivable as an adjustment to consumer financing interest revenue using the effective
interest method.
The allowance for notes receivable losses is calculated using the Company’s historical default percentages and other factors such as economic
conditions, industry trends, defaults and the age of past due amounts to analyze the adequacy of the allowance. Any adjustments to the allowance for
Vacation Interests notes receivable are recorded within the provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales revenue.
See “Note 6—Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance” for more information on how Vacation Interests notes receivable are presented
after giving effect to the Apollo Merger and the Company’s policy for recording impairments.
Due from Related Parties and Due to Related Parties—Amounts due from related parties and due to related parties consist primarily of
transactions with VOAs or Collection Associations for which the Company acts as the management company. Due to related parties also includes
amounts accrued related to the management agreement with Apollo and Reverence relating to the provision of management consulting and advisory
services to the Company. See “Note 7—Transactions with Related Parties” for further detail.
Other Receivables, net—Other receivables, net consists primarily of Sampler Package receivables and interest receivable. The Company evaluates,
among other things, defaults and the age of past due amounts to analyze the adequacy of the allowance for other receivables. The allowance for other
receivables as of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
Any adjustments to the allowance are recorded within management and member services revenue or Vacation Interests carrying cost, net.
Unsold Vacation Interests—Unsold Vacation Interests are valued at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The cost of unsold VOIs
includes acquisition costs, undeveloped land, hard and soft construction costs (comprised of architectural and engineering costs incurred during
construction), the cost incurred to recover inventory and other carrying costs (including interest, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the
construction period). The costs capitalized for recovered VOIs differ based on a variety of factors, including the method of recovery and the timing of the
original sale. Costs are expensed as VOIs are sold to Vacation Interests cost of sales under the relative sales value method, described above. The
Company also records Vacation Interests purchases in-transit, which are purchases of Vacation Interests from third parties for which title has not been
transferred to the Company. These Vacation Interests purchases in-transit are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and are reclassified to
unsold Vacation Interests upon successful transfer of title.
Property and Equipment, net—Property and equipment are recorded at either cost to acquire or construct or fair value in the case of assets
acquired through a business combination. The costs of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized when incurred,
and all associated repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives, which range
from one to 40 years, or the remainder of the lease terms. Furniture, office equipment, computer software and computer equipment are depreciated using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less
than its net book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset.
Goodwill—Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually
identified and separately recognized. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but rather evaluates goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis
or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the
carrying amount, including goodwill, which may include a qualitative assessment (a “step zero” assessment). If the qualitative assessment determines
that it is not “more-likely- than-not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is
determined to exist for the reporting unit.
If the qualitative step zero assessment indicates that it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
value including goodwill, or the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative assessment, then goodwill is assessed for impairment. The Company
performs its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company recognizes
an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
Intangible assets—Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See “Note 13—Other
Intangible Assets, net” for information on estimated useful lives.
The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an
asset is less than its net book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. In
relation to the intangible asset for management contracts, the Company has the intent and ability to renew the underlying management contracts and
most of such contracts auto-renew.
Foreign Currency Translation—Assets and liabilities in foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars using rates of exchange in effect at the
end of the reporting period. Income and expense accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange. The net gain or loss is shown
as a translation adjustment and is included in other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated financial statements.
Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income—Other comprehensive (loss) income includes all changes in equity from non-owner sources such as foreign
currency translation adjustments.
Fair Value Measurements—Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Company’s
accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a

liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes: Level 1
inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; and Level 3 inputs, which are
unobservable inputs.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes
—Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASU No. 2019-12”), which amends existing guidance related to calculating income taxes in interim
periods and the recognition of franchise tax, among other clarifications. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2019-12 on January 1, 2021, and is currently evaluating the
standard to determine the impact of adoption on the Company’s financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform” (“ASU No. 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and
exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. These optional amendments were effective for all entities upon
issuance and can be applied to certain contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The Company did not have any qualifying contract
modifications in the year ended December 31, 2020 and will continue to evaluate whether this guidance impacts future contract modifications as they
occur.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU No. 2016-02”). This standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a
lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer that 12 months. Leases are classified as either
finance or operating. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No 2016-02, and all the related amendments, using the modified retrospective
method.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”
(“ASU No. 2016-13”), which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held as of the reporting date based on historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 and all of the
related amendments, which have been included in Accounting Standards Codifications as ASC 326—Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (“ASC 326”),
on a prospective basis. As the Company’s historical approach for estimating allowance for loan losses aligns with the expected credit model required by
ASU No. 2016-13, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. See “Note 6—Vacation Interests
Notes Receivable and Allowance” for additional disclosures related to the Company’s allowance for loan losses.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing
Arrangement that is a Service Contract” (“ASU No. 2018-15”), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting
arrangement that is a service contract with requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The
Company adopted ASU No. 2018-15 on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

Note 3—Concentrations of Risk
Credit Risk—The Company offers financing to the buyers of VOIs and in most cases bears the risk of defaults on promissory notes delivered to it
by these buyers. Generally, if a buyer defaults, the Company recovers the VOI to offer for resale, in which case the associated selling, marketing and
administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered, and such costs must be incurred again to resell the VOIs. Although in many cases the
Company may have recourse against a buyer of VOIs for the unpaid price, certain states have laws that limit the Company’s ability to recover personal
judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans. The Company has generally not pursued this remedy.
The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, cash in escrow and restricted cash with various financial institutions located throughout North
America, Europe and the Caribbean. A significant portion of the Company’s cash is maintained with a select few banks and is, accordingly, subject to
credit risk. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of financial institutions maintaining the deposits are performed to evaluate and mitigate, if
necessary, any credit risk.
Availability of Funding Sources—The Company has historically funded Vacation Interests notes receivable and unsold Vacation Interests with
borrowings through its financing facilities and internally generated funds. Borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds received by the Company from
repayments of such Vacation Interests notes receivable. To the extent that the Company is not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financings,
it may have to curtail its sales and marketing operations or sell assets, thereby resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Geographic Concentration—Portions of the Company’s consumer loan portfolio have been concentrated in certain geographic regions within the
U.S. The deterioration of the economic condition and financial well-being of the regions in which the Company has significant loan concentrations could
adversely affect the results of operations for its consumer loan portfolio business. The credit risk inherent in such concentrations is dependent upon
regional and general economic stability, which affects property values and the financial well-being of the borrowers. As of the years ended December 31,
2020 and 2019, the Company’s loans to California residents constituted 26.0% and 27.0%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio. No other state or
foreign country concentration accounted for more than 10.0% of the portfolio.
Interest Rate Risk—Since a certain portion of the Company’s indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, any increase in interest rates,
particularly if sustained, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company may enter
into derivative financial instruments on a periodic basis to mitigate this risk. See “Note 20—Fair Value Measurements” for additional information.
The Company derives net interest income from its financing activities because the interest rates it charges its customers who finance the purchase
of their VOIs exceed the interest rates the Company pays to its lenders. Since the Company’s Vacation Interests notes receivable generally bear interest at
fixed rates, increases in interest rates will erode the spread in interest rates that the Company has historically obtained.

Contract balances and contract costs
The Company will recognize contract balances for deferred revenue related to payments collected before the Company’s performance obligations
are met. For more detailed information about outstanding performance obligations see “Note 15—Deferred Revenues.”
The Company does not have material contract acquisition costs related to management and member services and pays sales commissions on the
sale of VOIs. Incremental fees and commissions paid are not recoverable as those commissions paid related to the sale of points, therefore commissions
related to the sale of points are recognized in connection with the sale. However, commissions related to incentives are recoverable and therefore
capitalized as contract costs. These contract costs are recognized at the point in time that the revenue related to the incentive is recognized and included
within Vacation Interests carrying cost, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Capitalized costs were $18.4 million
and $19.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and total amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was

Note 6—Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance
The Company provides financing to certain purchasers of VOIs, which are collateralized by their VOIs. Eligibility for this financing is principally
dependent upon the customer’s Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) credit scores and other factors, which are based on review of the customers’ credit
history. As of December 31, 2020, Vacation Interests notes receivable bore interest at fixed rates between 5.0% and 24.0%. The Vacation Interests notes
receivable originated by the Company generally have a term of 10 years and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The weighted average interest
rate of outstanding Vacation Interests notes receivable was 15.2% and 15.0% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company’s accrued interest on Vacation Interest notes receivable is accrued based on the contractual provisions of the loan documents, which
is suspended at the earlier of (i) the customer’s account becoming over 90 days delinquent, or (ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure
proceedings. If payments are received while a consumer loan is considered delinquent, interest is recognized on a cash basis. Interest accrual resumes
once a customer has brought the account current. Based the Company’s policy to timely charge-off accrued interest, the Company does not require an
allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. Write-offs related to accrued interest receivables included in consumer financing interest
revenue were $11.6 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accrued interest receivables are presented in
other receivables on the balance sheet and were $8.6 million and $10.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company charges off Vacation Interests notes receivable upon the earlier of: (i) the customer’s account becoming over 120 days delinquent; or
(ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure proceedings. Vacation Interests notes receivable—securitized are collateralized against the Company’s
various borrowings which are included in Securitization notes and Funding Facilities, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 9
—Variable Interest Entities” and “Note 16—Borrowings” for further detail.
As a result of COVID-19 on the current economic environment, the Company has offered one to six month payment deferrals on eligible Vacation
Interests note receivable during 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the principal balance of originated and acquired notes included in payment deferral
programs was $27.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

related to COVID-19 of $45.0 million recognized in the first quarter of 2020.
Estimating the amount of the incremental loan loss allowance for COVID-19 involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
management based its estimates on a combination of several factors, including Company’s historical default data during the most recent recession in
2008, industry data, and the Company’s recent aging trends. The Company has updated its analysis as of December 31, 2020 and will continue to monitor
this estimate as more information becomes available.

2018, respectively.
Acquired Notes
The Company’s Vacation Interest Notes receivable originated prior to the Apollo Merger, or acquired notes, were historically accounted for using
the expected cash flows method of recognizing discount or premium accretion based on the acquired notes’ expected cash flows pursuant to ASC 310-30,
“Loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality.” The Company’s historical estimates for expected cash flows on acquired notes aligns with the expected
credit loss model required by ASU 2016-13, which requires the evaluation of past events, current economic conditions as well as expectations for the
future based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company’s allowance for credit losses is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
Due to current economic downturn resulting from COVID-19, the Company evaluated the potential impact of COVID-19 on the allowance for credit
losses on its acquired notes. Due to expected increases in defaults as a result of the economic downturn, the Company’s increased its allowance for credit
losses by $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 using similar estimates and assumptions used in its estimate for the allowance for loan losses on
originated notes. The incremental credit loss is included in impairment and other write-offs in the consolidated statement of operations and

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
securitized through SPEs, with such SPEs being legally separate entities from the Company. The activities of these SPEs are limited primarily to
purchasing qualifying Vacation Interests notes receivable from the Company and issuing debt securities and/or borrowing under a debt facility to
facilitate such purchases. The notes held by the SPEs are not available to creditors of the Company and are not legal assets of the Company, nor is the
debt that is securitized through the SPEs a legal liability of the Company.
The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these SPEs, and consequently consolidates such entities. The Company does not
recognize gains or losses resulting from these securitizations at the time of sale to the SPEs, and recognizes interest income over the contractual life of the
securitized notes and services the securitized notes under negotiated servicing agreements.
The assets and liabilities of these consolidated SPEs as of December 31 of each of the years presented below consisted of the following (in

(b)
Accumulated goodwill impairment was $141.2 million and $37.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
As a result of global economic uncertainty and the closure of most of the Company’s resorts and sales centers due to COVID-19 during the first
quarter of 2020, the Company tested goodwill recorded on its North America Vacation Interests sales and financing (“NA VISF”) reporting unit for
impairment by comparing the fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.
The fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit was determined using a combination of both an income approach, based on the present value of
discounted cash flows, and a market approach. Due to current market volatility and lack of reliable market data, the Company determined that the income
approach provided a more reliable estimate of the fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized a full
impairment charge totaling $103.4 million in its Vacation Interests sales and financing reportable segment during the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in
tax benefit of $2.5 million.
The Company’s estimate of fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit was performed using Level 3 inputs utilizing estimated future cash flows
discounted at rates commensurate with the capital and cost of capital of comparable market participants. The income approach requires several
assumptions including those regarding future revenue growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins, and
capital expenditures, which are the basis for information used in the discounted cash flow model. The weighted-average cost of capital used in the income
approach ranged from 12.5% to 13.0%, with a terminal revenue growth rate of 3.0%.
There were no impairments of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2019.

DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
Senior Facilities
On September 2, 2016, DRII entered into an $800.0 million senior secured financing (the “Senior Facilities”) consisting of: (i) a $700.0 million term
loan facility with a maturity of seven years (the “Term Loan Facility”); and (ii) a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity of five years (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”). DRII may request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of (i) $275.0 million plus (ii) an additional amount if the Company attains certain leverage ratios, subject
to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders.
On April 16, 2018, the Company entered into an incremental assumption agreement with certain lenders of our Senior Facilities to borrow an
additional principal amount of $200.0 million of term loans (the “Incremental Term Loans”). The terms, conditions, and covenants applicable to the
Incremental Term Loans are consistent with those of the existing term loans under the Senior Facilities. The net proceeds of the Incremental Term Loans
were used to finance the acquisition of the Modern and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith.
On June 15, 2018, the Company repriced the $889.5 million of term loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities (the “Repricing”). The Repricing
effectively replaced DRII’s existing senior secured term loans (the “Existing Term Loans”) with senior secured term loans which bear interest equal to, at
the option of DRII, either (a) a London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the
interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the
highest of: (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum; (ii) the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal (or another similar rate as determined by
the administrative agent); or (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1% per annum, in each case plus an applicable margin of 3.75% for LIBOR loans and
2.75% for base rate loans (the “Repricing Term Loans”). The Repricing Term Loans bear a lower interest rate and have the same maturity date as the
Existing Term Loans.
DRII is required to pay a $2.2 million quarterly principal payment in respect of the Term Loan Facility and a commitment fee, at a rate equal to 0.5%
per annum, to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of any unutilized commitments thereunder. The interest rate for borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a step-down of 50 basis points per annum based on an achievement of certain net first lien senior secured
leverage ratios. DRII is also required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees on the daily stated amount of outstanding
letters of credit and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit. Commencing with the
year ended December 31, 2017, the Senior Facilities requires prepayments of excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement) which are subject to
acceptance by the lenders. The Company expects that the required prepayment due in April 2021, if any, will not be material.
All obligations under the Senior Facilities are secured by a pledge of DRII’s capital stock and substantially all of DRII’s assets and those of each
subsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the domestic subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries that
are not subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests consist of a first-priority lien with respect to the
collateral.
The Senior Facilities provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility. On August 12, 2020 and September 16, 2020, the Company entered into
incremental assumption agreements with certain lenders of the Senior Facilities primarily to extend the maturity of an aggregate $100.0 million of revolving
facility commitments from September 2, 2021 to June 2, 2023.
As of December 31, 2020, $8.0 million was committed to outstanding letters of credit. After consideration of the letter of credit commitments,
$92.0 million of additional borrowing capacity is available as of

December 31, 2020. To manage exposure to interest rate increases on variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest rate swap contracts. Refer to
“Note 20—Fair Value Measurements” for additional information.
First Lien Notes
On August 31, 2016, Dakota Merger Sub completed the offering of the $500.0 million first-priority senior secured notes due September 1, 2023 (the
“First Lien Notes”). On September 2, 2016, upon the completion of the Apollo Merger, DRII continued its existence as the issuer of the First Lien Notes
and the proceeds of the First Lien Notes were released from escrow to fund the Apollo Merger and to pay related fees and expenses.
DRII may redeem the First Lien Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the
indenture governing the First Lien Notes. DRII’s obligations under the First Lien Notes and the First Lien Notes Indenture are guaranteed, jointly and
severally, on a senior secured first-priority basis, by each of DRII’s present and future direct and indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries
that guarantee its Senior Facilities. The First Lien Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority security interests in the collateral owned
by DRII and the subsidiary guarantors that also secure the Senior Facilities, subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions as further described in the
First Lien Notes Indenture and the related security documents.
Senior Notes
On August 31, 2016, Dakota Merger Sub completed the offering of the $600.0 million senior notes due on September 1, 2024 (the “Senior Notes”).
On September 2, 2016, upon the completion of the Apollo Merger, DRII continued its existence as the issuer of the Senior Notes and the proceeds of the
Senior Notes were released from escrow to fund the Apollo Merger and to pay related fees and expenses.
DRII may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture
governing the Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Indenture”). DRII’s obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture are guaranteed,
jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by each of DRII’s present and future direct or indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries
that guarantee its Senior Facilities.
On December 19, 2018, DRII entered into an agreement with an agent to execute the repurchase of Senior Notes through open market purchases
(the “Bond Repurchase Plan”). The Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 million of the Senior Notes. The Bond Repurchase Plan
expired on June 15, 2019.
Securitization notes and Funding Facilities, net
As discussed in “Note 9—Variable Interest Entities,” the Company issues debt through the securitization of Vacation Interests notes receivable
and enters into Funding Facilities, which are issued through SPEs.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s securitized debt of $654.2 million, excluding debt issuance costs, was collateralized by $707.3 million of
underlying gross Vacation Interests notes receivable and related assets.
Funding Facilities
The Company enters into Funding Facilities, which are issued through SPEs (see “Note 9—Variable Interest Entities”). The Company’s Funding
Facilities bear a variable interest rate plus a margin and are subject to non-use fees. Borrowing under the Funding Facilities are non-recourse to the
Company (other than the applicable wholly-owned special purpose borrower) and contain financial covenants consistent with the Company’s other

Original Issue Discount and Debt Issuance Costs
Amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs included in interest expense consisted of the following for the years ended
December 31, presented below (in millions):
 
 
 2020  2019  2018  
Amortization of capitalized financing costs and original issue discounts
 $22.0  $21.2  $21.3
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company capitalized $4.1 million in financing costs related to the amendment of the Funding
Facilities and the extension of the Revolving Credit Facility. The reduction in maximum commitments on certain of the Company’s Funding Facilities
resulted in the write-off of $0.4 million of unamortized financing costs included in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Covenant Restrictions and Limitations
The Company’s Senior Facilities, the First Lien Notes, the Senior Notes, securitization notes and Funding Facilities all contain various restrictions
and limitations that may affect the Company’s business and affairs. These include, but are not limited to, restrictions and limitations relating to its ability
and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and other obligations, to make investments and acquisitions, to pay dividends and to repurchase
shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s Revolving Credit Facility includes a springing financial maintenance covenant that requires that
the Company’s net first lien leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt secured by first-priority liens on the collateral to last years’ Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Senior Facilities) not exceed 3.75 to 1.00. The covenant is only required to be tested on a quarterly basis when the
Revolving Credit Facility is more than 30% drawn (excluding up to $15.0 million of outstanding letters of credit) and will be a condition to drawings under
the Revolving Credit Facility that would result in more than 30% drawn thereunder. The failure of the Company to comply with any of these provisions, or
to pay its obligations, could result in foreclosure by the lenders of their security interests in the Company’s assets, and could otherwise have a material
adverse effect on the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
The anticipated maturities of the Company’s borrowings are as follows (in millions):

Note 17—Leases
A significant portion of the Company’s leases includes real estate leases for administrative facilities and sales offices, as well as, leases for office
equipment and vehicles. The longest of these lease obligations extends

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
into 2025. The Company has made an accounting policy election to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to leases with terms of 12 months
or less. With the exception of sales center leases, which contain significant non-lease marketing components, the Company has made an accounting
policy election to not separate non-lease components from lease components.
Typically, the Company’s real estate leases have minimum lease payments that increase over the life of the agreement by a fixed percentage or an
amount based upon the change in a designated index. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements have renewal options and options to purchase the
leased property which are both at the Company’s sole discretion and generally have not been determined reasonably certain of exercise. The depreciable
life of assets are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.
If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s estimate of its
incremental borrowing rate is calculated on a quarterly basis and incorporates various factors, including United States’ treasury rates and the Company’s
historical borrowing rates adjusted for collateralized borrowings.
Certain of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include variable payments based on a percentage of revenue or number of tours generated,
in excess of base rent while others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company’s equipment lease agreements typically
include variable payments based on performance, in excess of base rent. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any restrictive covenants or
material residual value guarantees.

years. The Company’s 2018 effective tax rate was impacted by asset impairment and permanently non-deductible book-tax differences.
The Company has considered the income tax accounting and disclosure implications of the relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security (“CARES”) Act enacted on March 27, 2020. The effect of tax law changes is generally required to be recognized in the interim period in
which the legislation is enacted and reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate, depending on the nature of the change. As of
December 31, 2020, the Company evaluated the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and has determined there to be an immaterial effect on the
December 31, 2020 computation of the effective income tax rate for the year. The Company will continue to evaluate the income tax provisions of the
CARES Act and monitor the developments in the jurisdictions where it has significant operations for tax law changes that could have income tax
accounting and disclosure implications. The Company recorded $6.6 million of employee retention payroll tax credits pursuant to the CARES Act and
similar foreign government programs in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
ASC 740 requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carry-forwards be recorded as an asset to the extent
that management assesses that realization is “more-likely-than-not.” Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to
generate sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period, including the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company
maintains a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions, including its branch operations in St. Maarten. Due to the
Company’s history of operating losses in those locations, and in the absence of significant objectively-verifiable positive evidence, the Company
believes that realization of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not “more-likely-than-not” and,
accordingly, has provided a valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $500.5 million of unused federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) carry-forwards, $300.8 million of unused
state NOLs, and $150.0 million of foreign NOLs with expiration dates from 2021 through 2038 (except for certain US and foreign NOLs that do not expire)
that may be applied against future taxable income, subject to certain limitations.
As a result of prior changes in ownership and the Apollo Merger, the Company’s ability to use its federal NOLs is subject to limitation calculations
under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“Section 382”), however, the Company is not currently subject to an NOL usage limitation under Section 382.
Our ability to utilize NOLs loss carryforwards against future U.S. federal taxable income may be limited in the future in the event of a 50% or more
ownership change in our 5% shareholders. Certain state NOLs may be subject to similar limitations.
ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with ASC 740 is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: the Company determines
whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold,
the Company presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement.

The gross amount of the unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2020 that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate was
zero.
The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize potential interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision. The
Company has accrued $0.6 million for the payment of interest in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.
It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefit will be reduced to zero during the next twelve months due to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.
The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions, both within the U.S. and outside of the U.S. The Company is no longer subject to income tax

Contractual Obligations
The Company has entered into various contractual obligations primarily related to sales center remodeling, property amenity improvement and
corporate office expansion projects. The total remaining commitment was $3.9 million as of December 31, 2020.
Hurricane Irma
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 hurricane, inflicted widespread damage to St. Maarten in the Caribbean, where two resorts in the
Company’s resort network are located. The hurricane adversely impacted the Company’s resort operations and caused significant damage to certain of
the resorts; however, the

Company’s managed resorts are covered by all-risk property insurance policies, as well as coverage for business interruption, with reasonable market
deductibles. The resorts located in St. Maarten reopened in January 2021 and the closure did not have a material negative financial impact to the
Company.
Acquisition-related Contingencies
In connection with an acquisition prior to the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to
purchase certain seller-retained Vacation Interests notes receivable in exchange for the right to recover the underlying VOIs (the “Default Recovery
Agreements”). Amounts due under the Default Recovery Agreements and included in accrued liabilities were $3.8 million and $7.3 million as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Litigation Related to the Apollo Merger
On October 21, 2016, a purported former stockholder of DRII filed a putative class action in the Court of Chancery in Delaware on behalf of DRII’s
former stockholders against its former directors and its former financial advisor (the “Delaware Action”). The plaintiff claimed that the former directors
breached their fiduciary duties in approving the tender offer by which affiliates of Apollo acquired DRII in the Apollo Merger, and that the former
financial advisor aided and abetted those alleged breaches. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the former directors improperly approved an incomplete
solicitation that was sent to DRII’s stockholders in connection with the tender offer, and failed to take certain required actions in the process preceding
the approval of the tender offer. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages. All defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court dismissed all
claims in the suit on July 13, 2017. On August 11, 2017, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court of the Court of Chancery’s decision,
with such appeal taken as to the dismissal of the claims against DRII’s former directors, but not taken with respect to the dismissal of the claims against
its former financial advisor. On February 20, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed the decision and remanded the case for further proceedings in the
Court of Chancery.
On August 29, 2018, plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which he added another former director and Apollo Management VIII, L.P as
defendants alleging that the former director breached his fiduciary duties to DRII’s stockholders and that Apollo Management VIII, L.P., as the acquirer of
DRII, aided and abetted the directors’ breaches of fiduciary duty. On October 15, 2018, Apollo Management VIII, L.P. and another defendant filed motions
to dismiss the claims alleged against them.
On July 23, 2018, another purported former stockholder of DRII filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada against DRII and certain of its former directors and officers (the “Nevada Action”). The plaintiff alleged that DRII’s disclosures in connection
with the Apollo Merger were false and misleading, in violation of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 24, 2018,
other purported former stockholders of DRII filed a Motion for Appointment of Counsel and for Appointment as Lead Plaintiffs and, on September 26,
2018, the Court granted the motion. Subsequently, on December 12, 2018, lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in which it added another officer of
DRII as a defendant and alleged additional claims under Section 14(e) as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On May 9, 2019,
DRII and all but one of the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.
On November 1, 2019, the parties in the Delaware Action agreed to a settlement that releases and discharges all of the claims asserted in both the
Delaware Action and the Nevada Action, and the plaintiffs in the Nevada Action signed an agreement supporting the settlement. The settlement includes
no admission of liability or fault by any defendant and a settlement payment that will be paid primarily by funds from available insurance and

which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Delaware Court of
Chancery entered an order and final judgment approving the settlement on February 20, 2020. On July 13, 2020, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the
Company made a final payment of $25.3 million.
Litigation Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates these
legal proceedings and claims at each balance sheet date to determine the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred, the Company’s ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss. The Company records a contingent litigation liability when it
determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued
liabilities of $8.2 million and $37.8 million for all legal matters that were contingencies as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. For
those legal contingencies as to which a loss is reasonably possible and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current
estimated range is up to approximately $2.9 million in excess of recorded accruals.
The Company has also recognized $21.0 million of expected insurance recoveries related to contingent litigation liabilities in other receivables on
the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, all amounts have been recovered.
While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm
the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, or materially adversely affect overall trends in the Company’s results of operations, legal proceedings are
inherently uncertain and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Note 20—Fair Value Measurements
Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value (the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date) are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
 
 
•
 Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
 
 
•
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.
 
 
•
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs used when little or no market data is available.

The table above excludes cash and cash equivalents and cash in escrow and restricted cash, which had fair values approximating their carrying

Level 3
The Company believes that the carrying value of Vacation Interests notes receivable, net approximated its fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019,
because the allowance for losses adjusts the carrying value of Vacation Interests notes receivable to management’s best estimate of collectability. See
“Note 6—Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance” for additional details related to the Company’s allowance for loan losses.
The fair value of borrowings under the Funding Facilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was determined based on an internal analysis
performed by the Company utilizing a discounted cash flow model.
The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure to interest rate increases on variable rate debt. On August 23, 2019, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of $300.0 million which provides that the Company pay interest at a fixed rate of
1.323% and receive interest at the one-month LIBOR rate. The interest rate swap expires in September 2022. The Company has not
 
F-42

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
designated the interest rate swap as a hedging instrument pursuant to ASC 815—Derivatives and Hedging; therefore, gains and losses associated with
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in corporate indebtedness interest expense as they occur.
The Company recognized a loss of $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes net cash payments of $2.1 million. The fair
value of interest rate swap contracts was $6.3 million and is recognized in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts was $1.8 million and is recognized in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2019. The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swap contracts based on valuation reports provided by the counterparty.
The inputs used to measure the fair value of interest rate swap contracts are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the credit risk data
used for the valuations, which were not directly observable and could not be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 2
The fair value of the borrowings under the Senior Facilities, the First Lien Notes, the Senior Notes, and the securitization notes as of December 31,
2020 and 2019 was determined using quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.
The fair value of notes payable, which are included in corporate indebtedness, net, was not calculated because they were either due within one
year or were immaterial.
Note 21—Stock-Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plan
On November 30, 2016, the Company established an equity incentive plan, which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 10.5 million shares of
Dakota’s common stock for awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) to certain
employees or directors of, or consultants to, the Company and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards are subject to performance-based and other
vesting conditions, and contain a change-of-control provision.
Dakota issues non-qualified stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors of Dakota and its subsidiaries. The non-qualified
stock option grants have a maximum contractual term of 10 years and exercise prices ranging from $10.00 to $18.88 per share. One-third of the grants
generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over a five-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon a “change in control” and
a grantee’s continued employment on the applicable vesting date (“Tranche A Service-Based Grants”). The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model to estimate the fair value of Tranche A Service-Based Grants.
The remaining two-thirds of the grants generally vest and become exercisable upon a “change in control,” provided that certain targeted levels of
performance have been achieved (“Tranche B Performance-Based Grants”). The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair
value of Tranche B Performance-Based Grants.
On September 25, 2020, the Company granted 0.7 million restricted stock units (“2020 RSUs”) and 2.2 million stock options (“2020 Options”) to
certain employees under its equity incentive plan. The 2020 RSUs have a weighted average fair value of $11.91 per share, vested in full on the grant date
and will be settled in common shares no later than March 2021. The 2020 Options have a maximum contractual term of 10 years, vest in equal annual
installments over a three- year period and are subject to accelerated vesting upon a “change in control” and a grantee’s continued service on the
applicable vesting date.

DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Continued
 
As of December 31, 2020, 1.2 million shares remained available for issuance as new awards under the Equity Incentive Plan.
Stock Options
The Company accounted for its stock-based compensation issued to its employees and non-employee directors (in their capacity as such) in
accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation.” For a stock-based award with service-only vesting conditions, the Company
measured compensation expense at fair value on the grant date and recognized this expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)
income over the expected term during which the grantees provided service in exchange for the award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period which they
occur. Expense related to the Tranche B Performance-Based Grants is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target
will be achieved. No compensation expense has been recognized to date since a “change in control” event has not occurred, nor is it considered
probable.
The expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock prices for a group of identified peer companies for the expected
term of the stock options on the grant date (which was significantly greater than the volatility of the S&P 500® index as a whole during the same period)
due to the lack of historical trading prices of the Company’s common stock. For the Tranche A Service-Based Grants, the average expected option life
represented the period of time the stock options were expected to be outstanding at the issuance date based on management’s estimate. The expected
term of the Tranche B Performance-Based Grants was based on the expected time to a liquidity event, such as a “change in control” event. The risk-free
interest rate was calculated based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield, with a remaining term that approximated the expected option life assumed at
the date of issuance. The expected annual dividend per share was 0% based on the Company’s expected dividend rate. All options are scheduled to
expire ten years from the grant date.
The fair value per share information, including related assumptions, used to determine compensation cost for the Company’s non-qualified stock
options consisted of the following as of December 31, of each of the following years:

Note 22—Stockholders’ Equity
Common and Preferred Stock
Dakota had 175.0 million shares of common stock authorized, at a par value of $0.01 per share, with 106.0 million shares issued and outstanding as
of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Dakota had 10.0 million authorized shares of preferred stock, at a par value of $0.01 per share, with no shares
issued or outstanding.
Dakota’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorize the Company to issue, without the approval of its stockholders, one or more
classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over the common stock
respecting dividends and distributions, as the Company’s board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock
could adversely impact the voting power or value of the common stock. The Company has the ability to set the terms related to any preferred stock which
may be issued, including repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences, as applicable.
Issuances of Common Stock
Following the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into a Management Investor Rights Agreement with certain employees and non-employee
directors of the Company and Apollo. The agreement governs certain aspects of the Company’s relationship with its management stockholders, contains
transfer restrictions on its common stock, and the Company may repurchase outstanding shares when the management stockholders’ employment with
the Company is terminated.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company calculates net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Basic net income (loss) per share is
calculated by dividing net income (loss) for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income by weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period
plus potentially dilutive common shares, such as stock options and restricted stock.
Dilutive potential common shares are calculated in accordance with the treasury stock method, which assumes that proceeds from the exercise of all
options are used to repurchase common stock at market value. The amount of shares remaining after the proceeds are exhausted represents the
potentially dilutive effect of the securities.

Note 23—Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has a qualified retirement plan (the “401(k) Plan”) with a salary deferral feature designed to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Subject to certain limitations, the 401(k) Plan allows participating U.S. employees to defer up to 60.0% of their
eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis. The 401(k) Plan allows the Company to make discretionary matching contributions of up to 50.0% of the first
6.0% of employee compensation. In March 2020, the Company temporarily eliminated 401(k) matching contributions as a liquidity preservation measure
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company made matching contributions to its 401(k) Plan of $0.7 million, $5.1 million and
$4.7 million, respectively.
In addition, the Company has a self-insured health plan that covers substantially all of its full-time employees in the U.S. The health plan uses
employee and employer contributions to pay eligible claims. To supplement this plan, the Company has a stop-loss insurance policy to cover individual
claims in excess of $0.4 million. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued $4.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for claims that have been
incurred but not reported. This accrual is recorded based on actuarial estimates that utilize the Company’s historical experience of claim payments and lag
period between the service dates and claim payment dates in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded $23.7 million, $31.0 million and $28.0 million, respectively, in expenses
associated with its health plans.
With certain exceptions, the Company’s European subsidiaries do not offer private health plans or retirement plans. The government in each
country offers national health services and retirement benefits, which are funded by employee and employer contributions.

Note 24—Segment Reporting
Reportable Segments
The Company presents its results of operations in two reportable segments: (i) Vacation Interests sales and financing, which includes operations
relating to the marketing and sales of Vacation Interests, as well as the consumer financing activities related to such sales and (ii) hospitality and
management services, which includes operations related to the management of resort properties and the Diamond Collections, operation of the Clubs,
food and beverage venues owned and managed by the Company and the provision of other services. While certain line items reflected on the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss fall completely into one of these reportable segments, other line items relate to revenues
or expenses which are applicable to both segments; specifically, other revenue and loan portfolio expense, which are allocated to the appropriate segment
based on the nature of the underlying transactions. Certain expense items (principally corporate interest expense, depreciation and amortization and
provision for income taxes) are not, in management’s view, allocable to either of these reportable segments, as they apply to the entire Company. In
addition, general and administrative expenses are not allocated to either of these reportable segments because, historically, management has not allocated
these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the Company’s different operational divisions. Accordingly, these expenses are presented
under corporate and other. The Company utilizes revenues and income (loss) before income taxes to assess the performance of its reportable segments.
Management believes that it is impracticable to allocate specific assets and liabilities related to each reportable segment. In addition, management
does not review balance sheets by business segment as part of their evaluation of operating segment performance. Consequently, no balance sheet
segment reports have been presented.

Agreement and Plan of Merger
On March 10, 2021, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HGV”), Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HGV (“Merger Sub” or “HGV Borrower”), Dakota and the indirect parent company of DRII, that is controlled
by investment funds and vehicles managed by Apollo, and certain stockholders of Dakota entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in accordance with applicable law,
Dakota will merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”) with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity after the Merger.
The board of directors of Dakota unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Dakota and its stockholders, and authorized, approved and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
Pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”),
among other things:
 
 
•
 Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Dakota (collectively, the “Diamond Shares”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into and exchanged for the right to receive, a number of shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of HGV (each, an “HGV Common Share”) and/or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of HGV
Common Shares (the “Merger Consideration”), calculated in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement and allocated among the various
sellers based on their respective ownership interests in Dakota in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 Each option to purchase Diamond Shares (each, an “Option”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time having an exercise price
per share immediately prior to the Effective Time that is less than the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Value (described further below) (each, an “In-the-Money Option”), whether vested or
unvested, will automatically cease to be outstanding and be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, a number of HGV Common Shares and/or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of HGV Common Shares equal to (x) (1) the product
of (A) the number of Diamond Shares subject to such In-the-Money Option, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio and multiplied by (C) the
Parent Stock Value minus (2) the aggregate exercise price of such In-the-Money Option, minus (3) an amount equal to the tax withholding
obligation that would be withheld pursuant to Section 3.5 of the Merger Agreement with respect to the payment to the holder of such In-
the-Money Options of an amount equal to the preceding clause (1) minus the preceding clause (2), divided by (y) the Parent Stock Value
(the “Option Consideration”) (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions applicable to such In-the-Money Option);
and
 
 
•
 All Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than In-the-Money Options will (i) to the extent not then vested,
become fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions
applicable to such option) and (ii) automatically be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time without payment therefor, and, to such
extent, will have no further force or effect
Apollo and the other Dakota stockholders are expected to receive 34.5 million of HGV Common Shares, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, subject
to customary adjustments. Upon closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), existing HGV shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined company
and Apollo will own approximately 28% of the combined company.

The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval of the proposed issuance of HGV Common Shares in connection with the
Merger (the “Share Issuance”) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matter at a special
meeting of stockholders (the “HGV Stockholder Approval”), (ii) the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) and the obtaining or filing of any consents, declarations or filings with antitrust
authorities in Mexico and Austria, (iii) the absence of certain legal restraints, (iv) the accuracy of the parties’ respective representations and warranties
contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality thresholds), (v) the material performance of the parties’ respective covenants
contained in the Merger Agreement, (vi) conditions relating to the absence of defaults under Dakota’s unsecured notes and absence of defaults and
sufficient availability under Dakota’s warehouse facilities, (vii) certain ancillary agreements having been delivered and not having been rescinded or
repudiated by certain parties, (viii) the approval of listing on the NYSE of the HGV Common Shares included in the Merger Consideration, subject only to
official notice of issuance and (ix) the absence of any Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on HGV and (x) the absence
of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on Dakota.
The parties have made customary representations and warranties, and agreed to customary covenants, in the Merger Agreement, including
regarding (i) the conduct of Dakota’s and HGV’s respective businesses during the pre-Closing period, (ii) subject to certain qualifications as set forth in
the Merger Agreement, the parties’ use of their respective reasonable best efforts to effect the expiration or termination of the required waiting period
under the HSR Act, obtain all other required regulatory approvals and otherwise consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable and (iii) HGV’s obligation to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as
promptly as reasonably practical after the date of the Merger Agreement, a definitive proxy statement with respect to a special meeting of its common
stockholders to be convened for purposes of obtaining the HGV Stockholder Approval, which will contain, subject to certain exceptions, the
recommendation of the board of directors of HGV that HGV common stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, the stockholders of Dakota will severally but not jointly indemnify HGV for certain matters, including breaches of fundamental
representations and covenants and certain pre-closing tax matters.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for HGV and Dakota, including (i) by either party (A) if the Merger is not consummated
on or before September 10, 2021 (subject to extension to December 9, 2021, under certain circumstances), (B) in the event of a material uncured breach by
the other party of any of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement, (C) in the event a final, non-appealable order or law
prohibits the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (D) if HGV does not obtain the HGV Stockholder Approval;
(ii) by HGV if the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has not been obtained and delivered to HGV by no later than 24
hours after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and (iii) by Dakota (A) in the event that, subject to certain conditions, HGV does not
consummate the Merger when required pursuant to the Merger Agreement or (B) prior to the time the HGV Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the board
of directors of HGV (or a committee thereof) has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation in favor of the Share Issuance. In the event HGV
does not consummate the Merger when required pursuant to the Merger Agreement and Dakota terminates the Merger Agreement, then, subject to
certain conditions, HGV may be required to pay a termination fee of $73.5 million to Dakota. Further, if either party terminates the Merger Agreement
following the board of directors of HGV (or a committee thereof) withdrawing, modifying or qualifying its recommendation in favor of the Share Issuance
and at such time the HGV Stockholder Agreement has not already been obtained, HGV may be required to pay a termination fee of $44.1 million to Dakota.
In the event the HGV Stockholder Approval is not obtained and the Merger Agreement is terminated for this reason, HGV will reimburse up to $7.5 million
of Dakota’s and its stockholders’ fees and expenses.

DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1—Business, Background and Basis of Presentation
Business and Background
Dakota Holdings, Inc., (“Dakota” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on June 27, 2016 by certain investment funds
affiliated with or managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Apollo”), including Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., along with
their parallel investment funds (the “Apollo Funds”). Dakota and its subsidiaries were established to complete the acquisition of Diamond Resorts
International, Inc. (“DRII”). DRII is a holding company, the principal asset of which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in its
subsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating subsidiary that has historically conducted the business described
below. Dakota, through its operating subsidiaries, conducts operations and generates income and cash flows, while Dakota conducts no separate
operations on a standalone basis.
Prior to the acquisition of DRII on September 2, 2016, Dakota had no operations or activity other than acquisition related costs. Subsequent to the
Apollo Merger (described below), Dakota became the holding company and derives all of its operating income and cash flows from DRII and its
subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation
Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreements discussed in Note 16 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company and its
subsidiaries have restrictions on their ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make distributions to Apollo and the Apollo Funds,
or make certain intercompany loans and advances. As a result of these restrictions, these parent company financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X, since the restricted net assets of Dakota’s subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X)
exceeds 25% of the Company’s consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2020.
Principles of Consolidation
On a standalone basis, Dakota records its investment in subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the
investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost plus any contributions and its equity share in undistributed net (loss) income of the subsidiaries minus any
dividends received. Dakota’s share of net income (loss) of its consolidated subsidiaries is included in net income (loss) on equity investment in
subsidiaries in the statements of operations. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying financial information
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report.
Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies used in the preparation of the parent financial statements are generally consistent with those used in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.
In conjunction with the acquisition of DRII, the Company applied the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, the fair value adjustments and
goodwill recognized from the transactions are recorded in the financial statements of its subsidiaries and presented as part of the Company’s investment
in subsidiaries on the balance sheet.
 
F-58
Table of Contents
Dakota does not currently anticipate paying dividends on common stock. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of common
stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the Board
of Directors deems relevant. Dakota as a holding company, has no direct operations and its ability to pay dividends is limited to its available cash on
hand and any funds received from subsidiaries. The terms of the indebtedness may restrict Dakota’s ability to pay dividends, or may restrict the
subsidiaries from paying dividends to Dakota. Under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is net assets minus liabilities
and capital, or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Additionally,
Dakota has not received any dividends from its consolidated subsidiaries.
Note 2—Stockholders’ Equity
Issuances of Common Stock
Following the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into a Management Investor Rights Agreement (the “MIRA”) with certain employees and non-
employee directors of the Company and Apollo. The agreement governs certain aspects of the Company’s relationship with our management
stockholders, contains transfer restriction on its common stock, and the Company may repurchase outstanding shares when the management
stockholders’ employment with the Company is terminated.
Note 3—Subsequent Events
The Company evaluated subsequent events through March 17, 2021, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On March 10, 2021, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HGV”), Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HGV (“Merger Sub” or “HGV Borrower”), Dakota and the indirect parent company of DRII, that is controlled
by investment funds and vehicles managed by Apollo, and certain stockholders of Dakota entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in accordance with applicable law,
Dakota will merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”) with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity after the Merger.
The board of directors of Dakota unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Dakota and its stockholders, and authorized, approved and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
Pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”),
among other things:
 
 
•
 Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Dakota (collectively, the “Diamond Shares”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into and exchanged for the right to receive, a number of shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of HGV (each, an “HGV Common Share”) and/or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of HGV
Common Shares (the “Merger Consideration”), calculated in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement and allocated among the various
sellers based on their respective ownership interests in Dakota in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
 
F-59
Table of Contents
 
•
 Each option to purchase Diamond Shares (each, an “Option”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time having an exercise price
per share immediately prior to the Effective Time that is less than the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Value (described further below) (each, an “In-the-Money Option”), whether vested or
unvested, will automatically cease to be outstanding and be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, a number of HGV Common Shares and/or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of HGV Common Shares equal to (x) (1) the product
of (A) the number of Diamond Shares subject to such In-the-Money Option, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio and multiplied by (C) the
Parent Stock Value minus (2) the aggregate exercise price of such In-the-Money Option, minus (3) an amount equal to the tax withholding
obligation that would be withheld pursuant to Section 3.5 of the Merger Agreement with respect to the payment to the holder of such In-
the-Money Options of an amount equal to the preceding clause (1) minus the preceding clause (2), divided by (y) the Parent Stock Value
(the “Option Consideration”) (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions applicable to such In-the-Money Option);
and
 
 
•
 All Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than In-the-Money Options will (i) to the extent not then vested,
become fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions
applicable to such option) and (ii) automatically be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time without payment therefor, and, to such
extent, will have no further force or effect
Apollo and the other Dakota stockholders are expected to receive 34.5 million of HGV Common Shares, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, subject
to customary adjustments. Upon closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), existing HGV shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined company
and Apollo will own approximately 28% of the combined company.
The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval of the proposed issuance of HGV Common Shares in connection with the
Merger (the “Share Issuance”) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matter at a special
meeting of stockholders (the “HGV Stockholder Approval”), (ii) the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) and the obtaining or filing of any consents, declarations or filings with antitrust
authorities in Mexico and Austria, (iii) the absence of certain legal restraints, (iv) the accuracy of the parties’ respective representations and warranties
contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality thresholds), (v) the material performance of the parties’ respective covenants
contained in the Merger Agreement, (vi) conditions relating to the absence of defaults under Dakota’s unsecured notes and absence of defaults and
sufficient availability under Dakota’s warehouse facilities, (vii) certain ancillary agreements having been delivered and not having been rescinded or
repudiated by certain parties, (viii) the approval of listing on the NYSE of the HGV Common Shares included in the Merger Consideration, subject only to
official notice of issuance and (ix) the absence of any Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on HGV and (x) the absence
of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on Dakota.
The parties have made customary representations and warranties, and agreed to customary covenants, in the Merger Agreement, including
regarding (i) the conduct of Dakota’s and HGV’s respective businesses during the pre-Closing period, (ii) subject to certain qualifications as set forth in
the Merger Agreement, the parties’ use of their respective reasonable best efforts to effect the expiration or termination of the required waiting period
under the HSR Act, obtain all other required regulatory approvals and otherwise consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable and (iii) HGV’s obligation to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as
promptly as reasonably practical after the date of the Merger Agreement, a definitive proxy statement with respect to a special meeting of its common
stockholders to be convened for purposes of obtaining the HGV Stockholder Approval, which will contain, subject to certain exceptions, the
recommendation of the board of directors of HGV that HGV common
 
F-60
Table of Contents
stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of Dakota will severally but not
jointly indemnify HGV for certain matters, including breaches of fundamental representations and covenants and certain pre-closing tax matters.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for HGV and Dakota, including (i) by either party (A) if the Merger is not consummated
on or before September 10, 2021 (subject to extension to December 9, 2021, under certain circumstances), (B) in the event of a material uncured breach by
the other party of any of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement, (C) in the event a final, non-appealable order or law
prohibits the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (D) if HGV does not obtain the HGV Stockholder Approval;
(ii) by HGV if the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has not been obtained and delivered to HGV by no later than 24
hours after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and (iii) by Dakota (A) in the event that, subject to certain conditions, HGV does not
consummate the Merger when required pursuant to the Merger Agreement or (B) prior to the time the HGV Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the board
of directors of HGV (or a committee thereof) has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation in favor of the Share Issuance. In the event HGV
does not consummate the Merger when required pursuant to the Merger Agreement and Dakota terminates the Merger Agreement, then, subject to
certain conditions, HGV may be required to pay a termination fee of $73.5 million to Dakota. Further, if either party terminates the Merger Agreement
following the board of directors of HGV (or a committee thereof) withdrawing, modifying or qualifying its recommendation in favor of the Share Issuance
and at such time the HGV Stockholder Agreement has not already been obtained, HGV may be required to pay a termination fee of $44.1 million to Dakota.
In the event the HGV Stockholder Approval is not obtained and the Merger Agreement is terminated for this reason, HGV will reimburse up to $7.5 million
of Dakota’s and its stockholders’ fees and expenses.
At the Closing, HGV, certain controlled affiliates of Apollo (the “Apollo Stockholders”) and, for certain limited purposes, Hilton Worldwide
Holdings Inc. (“Hilton”), will enter into a stockholders agreement in the form attached to the Merger Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”),
pursuant to which, among other things, the Apollo Stockholders will have board designation rights, registration rights and be subject to customary
standstill obligations. Immediately following the Effective Time, HGV’s board of directors will consist of nine members, seven of whom will be the current
directors of HGV and two of whom will be designated by the Apollo Stockholders.
Settlement of 2020 RSUs
As of March 17, 2021, the Company has issued 0.6 million shares of common stock, net of shares withheld for taxes, to settle the 2020 RSUs granted
in September 2020.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
Note 1—Business, Background and Basis of Presentation
Business and Background
Dakota Holdings, Inc., (“Dakota” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on June 27, 2016 by certain investment funds
affiliated with or managed by Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Apollo”), including Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., along with
their parallel investment funds (the “Apollo Funds”) and certain co-investors (Reverence Capital Partners, L.P., or “Reverence”). Dakota and its
subsidiaries were established to complete the acquisition of Diamond Resorts International, Inc. (“DRII”). DRII is a holding company, the principal asset
of which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in its subsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating
subsidiary that has historically conducted the business described below.
Prior to the acquisition of DRII on September 2, 2016 (the “Apollo Merger”), Dakota had no operations or activity other than acquisition related
costs. Subsequent to the Apollo Merger, Dakota became the holding company and derives all of its operating income and cash flows from DRII and its
subsidiaries. Other than (i) the acquisition of the equity securities of DRII and the payment of transaction costs at the closing of the Apollo Merger and
(ii) the issuance of Dakota Holdings common shares to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company; there has been no significant
activity related to DRII’s parent entities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See “Schedule I—Condensed Financial Information of
Parent Company” in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Annual Report”) for financial information of DRII’s
parent entities.
The Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in the hospitality and vacation ownership industry, with a worldwide resort network of global
vacation destinations located around the world, including the continental United States (“U.S.”), Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central
America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. The Company’s portfolio consists of resort properties (the “Portfolio
Properties”) that the Company manages, are included in one of the Diamond Collections or are Diamond branded resorts in which we own inventory, as
well as affiliated resorts and hotels, which the Company does not manage and which do not carry the Company’s brand, but are a part of the Company’s
network and, through THE Club® and other Club offerings (the “Clubs”), are available for its members to use as vacation destinations.
The Company’s operations consist of two interrelated businesses: (i) vacation interests (“VOIs” or “Vacation Interests”) sales and financing, which
includes marketing and sales of VOIs and consumer financing for purchasers of the Company’s VOIs; and (ii) hospitality and management services,
which includes operations related to the management of the homeowners associations (the “VOAs”) for resort properties and single-and multi-resort
trusts (collectively, the “Diamond Collections”), operations of the Clubs, operation of certain resort amenities and the provision of other hospitality and
management services.
Hilton Grand Vacation Merger Agreement
On March 10, 2021, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HGV”), Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HGV (“Merger Sub” or “HGV Borrower”), Dakota and the indirect parent company of DRII, that is controlled
by investment funds and vehicles managed by Apollo, and certain stockholders of Dakota entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in accordance with applicable law,
Dakota will merge with the Merger Sub (the “HGV Merger”) with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity after the Merger.
The board of directors unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including
the HGV Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interest
 
F-67Table of Contents
DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—Continued
 
of Dakota and its stockholders, and authorized, approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the HGV Merger.
Apollo and the other Dakota stockholders are expected to receive 34.4 million of HGV common shares, valued at approximately $1.3 billion, subject
to customary adjustments. Upon closing of the HGV Merger (the “Closing”), existing HGV shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined
company and Apollo and the other Dakota stockholders will own approximately 28% of the combined company. In connection with the HGV Merger, HGV
intends to repay Diamond’s Senior Facilities and First Lien Notes at the HGV Merger close.
Among other things, the Closing is subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the proposed issuance of HGV common shares in
connection with the HGV Merger (the “Share Issuance”) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on
such matter at a special meeting of stockholders (the “HGV Stockholder Approval”). See “Note 25—Subsequent Events” in the 2020 Annual report for
additional information related to terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020 the World Health Organization designated the recent coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a global pandemic. The results of operations for
the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 include impacts related to COVID-19 which have had a negative impact on the Company and the travel
and hospitality industry. In response to social distancing directives and significant restrictions on travel caused by COVID-19, the Company initially
closed most of its resorts and suspended its onsite sales and marketing operations. The Company has taken several steps to enhance liquidity, preserve
cash, reduce expenditures and provide financial flexibility, and the Company’s management is continuing to assess the evolving situation and will take
actions as appropriate.
Beginning in May 2020, as governmental authorities began to lift restrictions, the Company worked with health experts in establishing reopening
safety protocols. The Company’s management implemented and trained team members on the “Diamond Standard of Clean.” Since late May 2020, we
have re-opened the majority of our North American Portfolio Properties and onsite sales centers, albeit at reduced capacity levels and revenue has not
returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. Although, certain Club offerings and member benefits, such as cruise itineraries, remain unavailable, the Company
expects total revenue to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels late in 2021. The Company continues to monitor travel restrictions and prioritize the safety of its
customers and employees. This involves a continuous assessment of whether the closure of resorts is necessary due to potential tightening of
government restrictions, stay-at-home orders and the potential resurgence of coronavirus cases.
Based on the Company’s current estimates regarding the magnitude and length of the disruptions to business, the Company does not anticipate
these disruptions will impact our ability to meet our obligations when due or our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants for at least the
next 12 months. However, the ultimate magnitude and length of time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This
uncertainty will require the Company to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions.
Accordingly, our estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the Company’s results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies described in the 2020
Annual Report. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally
 
F-68
Table of Contents
DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—Continued
 
accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) have been omitted from the condensed consolidated quarterly financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature. The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the 2020 Annual
Report. Consolidated results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending December 31, 2021 or
any future period.
Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant Accounting Policies
Significant accounting policies are those policies that, in management’s view, are most important in the portrayal of the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations. The methods, estimates and judgments that the Company uses in applying its accounting policies have a significant
impact on the results that it reports in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Some of these significant accounting policies require the
Company to make subjective and complex judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2020 Annual Report for a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies.
Principles of Consolidation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which the Company has a
controlling financial interest, including certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”). All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of

In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate
Reform” (“ASU No. 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other
transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued.
These optional amendments were effective for all entities upon issuance and can be applied to certain contract modifications through December 31, 2022.
The Company did not have any qualifying contract modifications in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and will continue to evaluate whether this
guidance impacts future contract modifications as they occur.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740):—Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASU No. 2019-
12”), which amends existing guidance related to calculating income taxes in interim periods and the recognition of franchise tax, among other
clarifications. The new

Contract balances and contract costs
The Company will recognize contract balances for deferred revenue related to payments collected before the Company’s performance obligations
are met. For more detailed information about outstanding performance obligations see “Note 11—Deferred Revenues.”
The Company does not have material contract acquisition costs related to management and member services and pays sales commissions on the
sale of VOIs. Incremental fees and commissions paid are not recoverable as those commissions paid related to the sale of points, therefore commissions
related to the sale of points are recognized in connection with the sale. However, commissions related to incentives are recoverable and therefore
capitalized as contract costs. These contract costs are recognized at the point in time that the revenue related to the incentive is recognized and included
within Vacation Interests carrying cost, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Capitalized costs were
$19.1 million and $18.4 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and total amortization was $1.5 million and $3.7 million, for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Note 4—Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance
The Company provides financing to certain purchasers of VOIs, which are collateralized by their VOIs. Eligibility for this financing is principally
dependent upon the customer’s Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) credit scores and other factors, which are based on review of the customer’s credit
history. As of March 31, 2021, Vacation Interests notes receivable bore interest at fixed rates generally between 5.0% and 24.9%. The Vacation Interests
notes receivable originated by the Company generally have a term of 10 years and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The weighted average
interest rate of outstanding Vacation Interests notes receivable was 15.2% as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
The Company’s accrued interest on Vacation Interests notes receivable is accrued based on the contractual provisions of the loan documents,
which is suspended at the earlier of (i) the customer’s account becoming over 90 days delinquent, or (ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure
proceedings. If payments are received while a consumer loan is considered delinquent, interest is recognized on a cash basis. Interest accrual resumes
once a customer has brought the account current. Based the Company’s policy to timely charge-off accrued interest, the Company does not require an
allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. Write-offs related to accrued interest receivables included in consumer financing interest
revenue were $2.5 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accrued interest receivables are presented in
other receivables on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and were $8.5 million and $8.6 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
respectively.
The Company charges off Vacation Interests notes receivable upon the earlier of: (i) the customer’s account becoming over 120 days delinquent; or
(ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure proceedings. Vacation Interests notes receivable—securitized are collateralized against the Company’s
various borrowings which are included in securitization notes and Funding Facilities, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities” and “Note 12—Borrowings” for further detail.
As a result of COVID-19 on the current economic environment, the Company has offered one to six month payment deferrals on eligible Vacation
Interests notes receivable beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the principal balance of originated and “Acquired Notes” (the
Company’s Vacation Interests notes receivable originated prior to the Apollo Merger), included in payment deferral programs was $22.2 million and
$4.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the principal balance of originated and Acquired Notes that participated in a payment deferral
programs was $27.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

Originated Notes
As described in “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” the Company adopted ASC No. 2016-13 and the related amendments
which have been included in ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020. The allowance for loan losses on the Company’s originated Vacation Interests notes
receivable represents an estimate of variable consideration for the implicit right of return on financed VOI sales. Variable consideration is estimated based
on the expected value method to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal is not expected to occur.
The Company’s historical estimates for variable consideration on originated notes aligns with the expected credit loss model required by ASU 2016-
13, which requires the evaluation of past events, current economic conditions as well as expectations for the future based on reasonable and supportable
forecasts. The Company’s allowance for loan losses is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company’s provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales was $28.8 million and $100.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively, of which there was an incremental loan loss included in the provision, related to COVID-19 of $0.0 million and $45.0 million,
respectively, for both of these periods.
Estimating the amount of the incremental loan loss allowance for COVID-19 involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Management based its estimates on a combination of several factors, including Company’s historical default data during the most recent recession in
2008, industry data, and the Company’s recent aging trends. The Company continues to monitor this estimate as more information becomes available.

The provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales shows activity in the allowance for loan losses associated with Vacation Interests notes receivable and includes
adjustments related to deferred revenue.
The Vacation Interests notes receivable, net balance related to originated notes also includes deferred origination costs. Vacation Interests notes
receivable origination costs incurred in connection with providing financing for VOIs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of Vacation
Interests notes receivable as a decrease to consumer financing interest revenue using the effective interest method. Amortization of deferred origination
costs charged to consumer financing interest revenue were $3.8 million and $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Acquired Notes
The Company’s Acquired Notes were historically accounted for using the expected cash flows method of recognizing discount or premium
accretion based on the Acquired Notes’ expected cash flows pursuant to ASC 310-30, “Loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality.” The Company’s
historical estimates for expected cash flows on Acquired Notes aligns with the expected credit loss model required by ASU 2016-13, which requires the
evaluation of past events, current economic conditions as well as expectations for the future based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. The
Company’s allowance for credit losses is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
Due to the current economic downturn resulting from COVID-19, the Company evaluated the potential impact of COVID-19 on the allowance for
credit losses on its Acquired Notes in the first quarter of 2020. Due to expected increases in defaults as a result of the economic downturn, the Company
increased its allowance for credit losses by $14.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 using similar estimates and assumptions used in its
estimate for the allowance for loan losses on originated notes. The incremental credit loss is included in impairment and other write-offs in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company will continue to monitor this estimate as more information
becomes available.

Note 5—Transactions with Related Parties
Apollo and Apollo Funds
In connection with the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into a management consulting agreement with Apollo and Reverence Capital Partners,
L.P.(“Reverence”), relating to the provision of management consulting and advisory services to the Company. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company is required to pay to affiliates of Apollo and Reverence an annual fee equal to the greater of $5.0 million or 2% of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(as defined in the indenture governing the First Lien Notes, or the “First Lien Notes Indenture”). See “Note 12—Borrowings” for additional detail on the
First Lien Notes. The agreement has a term of eight years, with 12-month auto renewals on the eight and the ninth anniversaries of the Apollo Merger,
and the maximum term of the agreement is 10 years. Fees incurred under the agreement were $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in general and administrative expense. Amounts due under this agreement and included in due to
related parties, net were $2.0 million and $0.7 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Management Services
Included within the amounts reported as management and member services revenue are revenues from resort management services provided to the
VOAs and the Collection Associations, which totaled $65.9 million and $70.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Note 6—Variable Interest Entities
The Company sells pools of qualifying Vacation Interests notes receivable to special purpose entities (“SPEs”), with qualification based on factors
such as the credit strength of the VOI purchaser. The notes are securitized through SPEs, with such SPEs being legally separate entities from the
Company. The activities of these SPEs are limited primarily to purchasing qualifying Vacation Interests notes receivable from the Company and issuing
debt securities and/or borrowing under a debt facility to facilitate such purchases. The notes held by the SPEs are not available to creditors of the
Company and are not legal assets of the Company, nor is the debt that is securitized through the SPEs a legal liability of the Company.
The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these SPEs, and consequently consolidates such entities. The Company does not
recognize gains or losses resulting from these securitizations at the time of sale to the SPEs, and recognizes interest income over the contractual life of the
securitized notes and services the securitized notes under negotiated servicing agreements.
The assets and liabilities of these consolidated SPEs as of the periods presented below consisted of the following (in millions):

(a)
Accumulated goodwill impairment was $103.4 million for all periods presented.
As a result of global economic uncertainty and the closure of most of the Company’s resorts and sales centers due to COVID-19, the Company
tested goodwill recorded on its North America Vacation Interests sales and financing (“NA VISF”) reporting unit for impairment by comparing the fair
value of the NA VISF reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill as of March 31, 2020.
The fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit was determined using a combination of both an income approach, based on the present value of
discounted cash flows, and a market approach. Due to current market volatility and lack of reliable market data, the Company determined that the income
approach provided a more reliable estimate of the fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized a full
impairment charge totaling $103.4 million in its Vacation Interests sales and financing reportable segment for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
which resulted in tax benefit of $3.3 million.
The Company’s estimate of fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit was performed using Level 3 inputs utilizing estimated future cash flows
discounted at rates commensurate with the capital and cost of capital of comparable market participants. The income approach requires several
assumptions including those regarding future revenue growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins, and
capital expenditures, which are the basis for information used in the discounted cash flow model. The weighted-average cost of capital used in the income
approach ranged from 12.5% to 13.0%, with a terminal revenue growth rate of 3.0%.
There were no impairments of goodwill for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

First Lien Notes
On August 31, 2016, Dakota Merger Sub completed the offering of the $500.0 million first-priority senior secured notes due September 1, 2023 (the
“First Lien Notes”). On September 2, 2016, upon the completion of the Apollo Merger, DRII continued its existence as the issuer of the First Lien Notes
and the proceeds of the First Lien Notes were released from escrow to fund the Apollo Merger and to pay related fees and expenses.
DRII may redeem the First Lien Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the
indenture governing the First Lien Notes. DRII’s obligations under the First Lien Notes and the First Lien Notes Indenture are guaranteed, jointly and
severally, on a senior secured first-priority basis, by each of DRII’s present and future direct and indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries
that guarantee its Senior Facilities. The First Lien Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority security interests in the collateral owned
by DRII and the subsidiary guarantors that also secure the Senior Facilities, subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions as further described in the
First Lien Notes Indenture and the related security documents.
Senior Notes
On August 31, 2016, Dakota Merger Sub completed the offering of the $600.0 million senior notes due on September 1, 2024 (the “Senior Notes”).
On September 2, 2016, upon the completion of the Apollo Merger, DRII continued its existence as the issuer of the Senior Notes and the proceeds of the
Senior Notes were released from escrow to fund the Apollo Merger and to
pay related fees and expenses.
DRII may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture
governing the Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Indenture”). DRII’s obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture are guaranteed,
jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by each of DRII’s present and future direct or indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries
that guarantee its Senior Facilities.
On December 19, 2018, DRII entered into an agreement with an agent to execute the repurchase of Senior Notes through open market purchases
(the “Bond Repurchase Plan”). The Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 million of the Senior Notes. The Bond Repurchase Plan
expired on June 15, 2019.
Securitization notes and Funding Facilities, net
As discussed in “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities,” the Company issues debt through the securitization of Vacation Interests notes receivable
and enters into Funding Facilities, which are issued through SPEs. As of March 31, 2021, the Company’s securitized debt of $569.5 million, excluding debt
issuance costs, was collateralized by $610.6 million of underlying gross Vacation Interests notes receivable and related assets.
DROT 2021-1
On April 20, 2021, we completed a securitization transaction involving the issuance of $319.2 million of securities (the DROT 2021-1 Notes”). The
DROT 2021-1 Notes consists of four tranches of Vacation Interest

Table of Contents
DAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—Continued
 
notes receivable that include $134.1 million of Class A tranche notes, $83.2 million of Class B tranche notes, $65.4 million of Class C tranche notes and
$36.5 million of Class D tranche notes. The interest rates for the Class A tranche notes, the Class B tranche notes, the Class C tranche notes and the
Class D tranche notes are 1.51%, 2.05%, 2.70% and 3.83% respectively. The overall weighted average interest rate of the DROT 2021-1 Notes is 2.0%.
The proceeds of the DROT 2021-1 Notes were used to repay $134.1 million aggregate principal amounts outstanding under certain Funding
Facilities. The DROT 2021-1 Notes allow for a prefunding amount of $79.8 million which is available to draw subject to eligible Vacation Interests notes
receivable requirements as outlined in the DROT 2020-1 indenture. The remaining proceeds were used to fund reserve accounts and pay costs associated
with the transaction with the remaining cash transferred to us for general corporate purpose.
Funding Facilities
The Company enters into Funding Facilities, which are issued through SPEs (see “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities”). The Company’s Funding
Facilities bear a variable interest rate plus a margin and are subject to non-use fees. Borrowing under the Funding Facilities are non-recourse to the
Company (other than the applicable wholly-owned special purpose borrower) and contain financial covenants consistent with the Company’s other
existing facilities of this type and customary default provisions.

Covenant Restrictions and Limitations
The Company’s Senior Facilities, the First Lien Notes, the Senior Notes, securitization notes and Funding Facilities all contain various restrictions
and limitations that may affect the Company’s business and affairs. These include, but are not limited to, restrictions and limitations relating to its ability
and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and other obligations, to make investments and acquisitions, to pay dividends and to repurchase
shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s Revolving Credit Facility includes a springing financial maintenance covenant that requires that
the Company’s net first lien leverage ratio (the ratio

of consolidated net debt secured by first-priority liens on the collateral to last twelve months’ Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Senior
Facilities) not exceed 3.75 to 1.00. The covenant is only required to be tested on a quarterly basis when the Revolving Credit Facility is more than 30%
drawn (excluding up to $15.0 million of outstanding letters of credit) and will be a condition to drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility that would
result in more than 30% drawn thereunder. The failure of the Company to comply with any of these provisions, or to pay its obligations, could result in
foreclosure by the lenders of their security interests in the Company’s assets, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company. As of
March 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

12.7% 
The Company’s effective income tax rate of 13.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to
the effect of certain foreign income and losses includible in U.S. taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances applied to certain foreign losses and
permanent book-tax differences.
The Company has considered the income tax accounting and disclosure implications of the relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security (“CARES”) Act enacted on March 27, 2020. The effect of tax law changes is generally required to be recognized in the interim period in
which the legislation is enacted and reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate, depending on the nature of the change. As of March 31,
2021, the Company evaluated the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and has determined there to be an immaterial effect on the March 31, 2021
computation of the effective income tax rate for the year. The Company will continue to evaluate the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and monitor
the developments in the jurisdictions where it has significant operations for tax law changes that could have income tax accounting and disclosure
implications.
Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual Obligations
The Company has entered into various contractual obligations primarily related to sales center remodeling, property amenity improvement and
corporate office expansion projects. The total remaining commitment was $3.8 million as of March 31, 2021.
Hurricane Irma
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 hurricane, inflicted widespread damage to St. Maarten in the Caribbean, where two resorts in the
Company’s resort network are located. The hurricane adversely impacted the Company’s resort operations and caused significant damage to certain of
the resorts; however, the Company’s managed resorts are covered by all-risk property insurance policies, as well as coverage for business interruption,
with reasonable market deductibles. The resorts located in St. Maarten reopened in January 2021 and the closure did not have a material negative
financial impact to the Company.
Acquisition-related Contingencies
In connection with an acquisition prior to the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to
purchase certain seller-retained Vacation Interests notes receivable

in exchange for the right to recover the underlying VOIs (the “Default Recovery Agreements”). Amounts due under the Default Recovery Agreements
and included in accrued liabilities were $3.5 million and $3.8 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Litigation Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates these
legal proceedings and claims at each balance sheet date to determine the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred, the Company’s ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss. The Company records a contingent litigation liability when it
determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued
liabilities of $8.7 million and $8.2 million for all legal matters that were contingencies as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. For those
legal contingencies as to which a loss is reasonably possible and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current
estimated range is up to approximately $8.4 million in excess of recorded accruals.
While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm
the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, or materially adversely affect overall trends in the Company’s results of operations, legal proceedings are
inherently uncertain and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Note 16—Fair Value Measurements
Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value (the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date) are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
 
 
•
 Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
 
 
•
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.

The tables above exclude cash and cash equivalents and cash in escrow and restricted cash, which had fair values approximating their carrying
amounts due to the short maturities and liquidity of these items.
Level 3
The Company believes that the carrying value of Vacation Interests notes receivable, net approximated its fair value at March 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, because the allowance for losses adjusts the carrying value of Vacation Interests notes receivable to management’s best estimate of
collectability. See “Note 4—Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance” for additional details related to the Company’s allowance for loan
losses.
The fair value of borrowings under the Funding Facilities as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was determined based on an internal analysis
performed by the Company utilizing a discounted cash flow model.
The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure to interest rate increases on variable rate debt. On August 23, 2019, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of $300.0 million which provides that the Company pay interest at a fixed rate of
1.323% and receive interest at the one-month LIBOR rate. The interest rate swap expires in September 2022. The Company has not designated the interest
rate swap as a hedging instrument pursuant to ASC 815—Derivatives and Hedging; therefore, gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value
of the interest rate swap are recognized in corporate indebtedness interest expense as they occur.
The Company recognized a gain of $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which includes net cash payments of $0.9 million. The
fair value of interest rate swap contracts was $5.3 million and $6.3 million and is recognized in accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swap contracts based on valuation
reports provided by the counterparty. The inputs used to measure the fair value of interest rate swap contracts are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy based on the credit risk data used for the valuations, which were not directly observable and could not be corroborated by observable market
data.
Level 2
The fair value of the borrowings under the Senior Facilities, the First Lien Notes, the Senior Notes, and the securitization notes as of March 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020 was determined using quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.

The fair value of notes payable, which are included in corporate indebtedness, net, was not calculated because they were either due within one
year or were immaterial.
Note 17—Stock-Based Compensation
The Company provides stock-based compensation to certain employees or directors of, or consultants to, the Company and its subsidiaries under
its equity incentive plan in the form of stock options. Options awarded to certain non-employee directors vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant
date, while one-third of the options awarded to employees and certain other non-employee directors generally vest and become exercisable in equal
annual installments over a five-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon a “change in control” and a grantee’s continued service on the applicable
vesting date (“Tranche A Service-Based Grants”). The remaining two-thirds of the options awarded to employees and such other non-employee directors
generally vest and become exercisable upon a “change in control,” provided that certain targeted levels of performance have been achieved (“Tranche B
Performance-Based Grants”).
On September 25, 2020, the Company granted 0.7 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and 2.2 million stock options (“2020 Options”) to certain
employees under its equity incentive plan. The 2020 RSUs have a weighted average fair value of $11.91 per share and vested in full on the grant date. The
2020 Options have a maximum contractual term of 10 years, vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period and are subject to accelerated
vesting upon a “change in control” and a grantee’s continued service on the applicable vesting date.
In the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued 0.7 million shares of common stock, net of shares withheld for taxes, to settle the 2020 RSUs
granted in September 2020.

Note 18—Segment Reporting
Business Segment
The Company presents its results of operations in two reportable segments: (i) Vacation Interests sales and financing, which includes operations
relating to the marketing and sales of Vacation Interests, as well as the consumer financing activities related to such sales and (ii) hospitality and
management services, which includes operations related to the management of resort properties and the Diamond Collections, operation of the Clubs,
food and beverage venues owned and managed by the Company and the provision of other services. While certain line items reflected on the condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) fall completely into one of these reportable segments, other line items relate to
revenues or expenses which are applicable to both segments; specifically, other revenue and loan portfolio expense, which are allocated to the
appropriate segment based on the nature of the underlying transactions. Certain expense items (principally corporate interest expense, depreciation and
amortization and provision for income taxes) are not, in

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—Continued
 
management’s view, allocable to either of these reportable segments, as they apply to the entire Company. In addition, general and administrative
expenses are not allocated to either of these reportable segments because, historically, management has not allocated these expenses for purposes of
evaluating the performance of the Company’s different operational divisions. Accordingly, these expenses are presented under corporate and other. The
Company utilizes revenues and income (loss) before income taxes to assess the performance of its reportable segments.
Management believes that it is impracticable to allocate specific assets and liabilities related to each business segment. In addition, management
does not review balance sheets by business segment as part of their evaluation of operating segment performance. Consequently, no balance sheet
segment reports have been presented.

(c) Conversion of Company Securities. Subject to the limitations on payments and the timing of payments as set forth in Section 3.3, Section 3.4
and Article VIII, all shares of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (such stock, the “Company Common Stock” and such shares, the
“Company Shares”) (other than Appraisal Shares and those Company Shares referred to in Section 3.1(a)) validly issued and outstanding immediately

Allocation and determined as of the Effective Time by Parent and the Company in accordance with this Agreement.
(d) Appraisal Rights. Appraisal Shares will not be converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration. Holders of Appraisal
Shares shall be entitled to receive the fair value of such shares as shall be determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder’s right to receive the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares will be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time in accordance with
Section 3.1(c), without any interest. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal rights, and
Parent will have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except as required by Law, the
Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.
(e) Certain Adjustments. If, following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, (i) the number of outstanding Company
Shares is increased, decreased or otherwise changed or (ii) the number of outstanding Parent Common Shares is increased, decreased or otherwise
changed, in each case, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any other similar event, then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted proportionally to account for any such change;

Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Option Consideration (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting
conditions applicable to such In-the-Money Option).
(b) Underwater Options. For the avoidance of doubt, all other Options not described in Section 3.2(a) that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and in accordance with Section 8.3 and Article XII of the Company Stock Plan, (i) to the extent not then
vested, become fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full satisfaction of any performance-vesting conditions applicable to
such Option) and (ii) automatically be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time without payment therefor and, to such extent, shall have no further
force or effect.
(c) Actions by the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the Compensation Committee of the Company, as applicable,

and cancellation of Effective Time to beneficially own any Company Shares (or any derivative securities thereof) or to Options as described above and

case, without liability to Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates, other than the obligation to issue the shares as contemplated
by Section 3.2(a). Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with drafts
 
A-27Table of Contents
of all resolutions, consents and other written actions as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2 for Parent’s reasonable review
and comment. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, the Company is not

(a) Parent Stock Value; Cash Payment in Lieu of Fractional Shares.
(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the “Parent Stock Value” shall be equal to the VWAP for the ten (10) consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, such ten (10) trading day period shall conclude on the last trading day prior to
the Closing Date); provided, however, that if, during such ten (10) trading day period, Parent pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller
number of shares, or issues by reclassification any additional Parent Common Shares, then the Parent Stock Value shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted
shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Parent Stock Value. Parent and the Company shall, prior to the Closing, jointly provide written
notice to the Exchange Agent stating the Parent Stock Value.
(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued and if, after aggregating all Parent Common Shares
(including fractional shares) that would be issued hereunder to a Company Stockholder or Optionholder, as applicable, such aggregate number of
Parent Common Shares includes a fraction of a Parent Common Share, such Company Stockholder shall instead receive, with respect to its
Company Shares or Options, as applicable: (A) the number of full Parent Common Shares determined by rounding down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Common Shares, and (B) a cash payment equal to the product of (1) such fraction of a Parent Common Share, and (2) the Parent
Stock Value (a “Cash Payment in Lieu of Fractional Shares”).
(b) Exchange Agent. On the Closing Date, prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit to an account designated by such exchange agent chosen
by Parent reasonably acceptable to the Seller Representative and the Company (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of the Company
Shares (other than holders of Company Shares referred to in Section 3.3), evidence of book-entry shares representing a number of Parent Common Shares
equal to (i) aggregate Merger Consideration issuable in respect of Company Shares pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i) plus (ii) the aggregate Option
Consideration issuable in respect of In-the-Money Options pursuant to Section 3.2(a).
(c) Exchange Procedures. Prior to, on or promptly after the Closing Date (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent will
cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver (which may be by e-mail) a Letter of Transmittal to each Company Stockholder and Optionholder. At the
Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent, in accordance with the Optionholder Spreadsheet and the Consideration Allocation, to (i) with
respect to any Company Share for which Merger Consideration is issuable pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i), deliver to the holder of such Company Share
such portion of the Merger Consideration set forth in the Consideration Allocation with respect to such Company Share (other than to those holders of
Appraisal Shares not entitled to payment and holders of Company Shares referred to in Section 3.1(b)) by delivery to such Company Stockholder
evidence of book-entry notations evidencing such Merger Consideration, duly executed by Parent, along with the payment of any applicable Cash
Payment in Lieu of Fractional Shares, without interest, by check or wire transfer at the direction of such Company Stockholder and (ii) with respect to any
In-the-Money Option, deliver to the holder of such In-the-Money Option the Option Consideration with respect to such In-the-Money Option by
delivery to such Optionholder evidence of book-entry notations evidencing such Option Consideration, duly executed by Parent, along with the payment
of any applicable Cash Payment in Lieu of Fractional Shares, without interest, payable, (A) if such Optionholder is a current or former employee of the

Optionholder, in each case as promptly as practicable, and with respect to Company Stockholders or Optionholders (other than any Optionholder that is a
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), in any event within five (5) Business Days, following (I) the submission of a duly
executed letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the “Letter of Transmittal”), electronically or by mail, to the Exchange

(a) For a period of six years following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Agreement Date or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “D&O Indemnified Parties”) against, and pay or reimburse the D&O Indemnified Parties for, any and all
losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual
Action based in whole or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date or otherwise arising by virtue of their status as D&O Indemnified Parties (the “D&O
Indemnified Liabilities”), whether asserted or claimed at or after or occurring before the Closing (including in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise), in each case to the maximum
extent permitted or required under applicable Law to indemnify its own directors or officers (and Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Action or proceeding to each D&O Indemnified Party). In the event of any
such Action, (i) Parent shall, and shall cause the Company Entities to, cooperate with the D&O Indemnified Parties in the defense of any such Action and
(ii) without the prior written consent of the applicable D&O Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Company Entities not to, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Action pending or
threatened to which a D&O Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such D&O Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such D&O Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Action. Parent agrees that all rights of each D&O Indemnified Party to indemnification, advance expenses in connection with the defense of any
Action and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing as provided in the Organizational Documents of any of the
Company Entities and any indemnification agreements and in minutes of the board of directors, any committee of the board of directors or any equivalent
governing body of any of the Company Entities. All rights of each D&O Indemnified Party to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing as provided in the Organizational Documents of any of the Company Entities and in any indemnification
agreements set forth on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, including provisions relating to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any Action, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six
(6) years following the Closing, such rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of any of the
D&O Indemnified Parties for any acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing, unless such amendment or modification is approved by each such
D&O Indemnified Party. Any D&O Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.9 shall promptly notify Parent upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may have under
this Section 6.9(a) except to the extent such failure prejudices such party).
(b) Parent hereby acknowledges that certain D&O Indemnified Parties have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance provided by other entities and/or organizations, including by virtue of such D&O Indemnified Party’s service as a director, officer, manager,
member, agent, partner or other fiduciary or employee of an investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing (collectively, the
“Other Indemnitors” and, individually, an “Other Indemnitor”). Parent hereby agrees that, with respect to any advancement or indemnification obligation
owed, at any time, to any D&O Indemnified Party by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.9 or any Company Entity pursuant to its existing Organizational
 
A-74Table of Contents
Document, any indemnification agreement in effect as of the Agreement Date to which a Company Entity is a party and/or pursuant to Section 6.9(a) (any
of the foregoing, an “Indemnification Agreement”), Parent and the Company Entities (i) shall at all times, be the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., their
obligations to a D&O Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.9 shall be primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such D&O Indemnified Party shall be secondary), (ii) shall be responsible for the
advancement and payment of expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement, which are addressed by Section 6.9(a) (to the extent
not legally prohibited and as required by the terms of this Agreement or any Indemnification Agreement), without regard to any rights that such D&O
Indemnified Party may have against the Other Indemnitors and (iii) irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims
(A) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof and (B) that the
D&O Indemnified Party must seek expense advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Other Indemnitor before Parent or the Company
Entities must perform their expense advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this Agreement. Parent, and following the
Closing each Company Entity, hereby further agrees that no advancement, indemnification or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of a
D&O Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which a D&O Indemnified Party has sought indemnification from Parent or any Company Entity shall
affect the foregoing.
(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, except as required by applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Organizational Documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the D&O Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of liabilities, advancement
of expenses and indemnification than are set forth as of the Agreement Date in the Organizational Documents of the applicable Company Entity.
(d) For a period of six years following the Closing, Parent shall maintain officers’ and directors’ liability insurance covering the persons who are
presently covered by their officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date,
providing coverage not less favorable to the insureds than provided by such insurance in effect on the Agreement Date; provided, however, that in no
event shall Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to pay annual premiums greater than 300% of the aggregate premiums
payable as of the Agreement Date; provided further, that if the annual premium for such coverage and amount of insurance would exceed 300% of such
current annual rate, Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall provide the maximum coverage which shall then be available at an annual
premium not exceeding 300% of such rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parent’s election, in lieu of maintaining such coverage, the Company shall
obtain a “tail” policy (a “D&O Tail Policy”) covering the persons who are presently covered by their officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies
with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date, providing coverage for a period of six years following the Effective Time not
less favorable to the insured person than provided by such insurance in effect on the Agreement Date. Parent shall not take or omit to take any action
that would cause any such “tail” policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term (except that in no event shall Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to pay a premium for such policy greater than 300% of the aggregate annual premiums payable as of the
Agreement Date for the Company and its Subsidiaries’ current officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies); provided that if the premium would
exceed 300% of such aggregate annual rate, then the Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy providing the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium not exceeding 300% of such rate.
(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates or merges with or into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or engages in any division transaction or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall procure that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.9.

any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in

Seller Representative, prepare the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of Parent (such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented, the
“Proxy Statement”) and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC (and use reasonable best efforts to file no later than twenty (20) Business Days following

within ten (10) Business Days following the Agreement Date all such audited or interim financial statements, related notes, and other financial information
with respect to the Company Entities that is reasonably required to be included in the Proxy Statement). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and the Seller
Representative will cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, including by furnishing to
Parent and Merger Sub the information relating to any of the Company Entities or the Sellers required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, preparing and furnishing all such audited, interim and pro forma financial statements,

provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy
Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading. Parent shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the

purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, including the establishment of a record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at such

periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a reasonably timely basis (including, if requested, promptly providing voting reports on a
reasonably frequent basis). Without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
approval of the Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter (other than related procedural matters (including adjournment or postponement) or any
non-binding advisory vote required under applicable Law) that Parent may propose to be acted on by Parent’s stockholders at the Parent Stockholders

possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Committed Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as possible, (a) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to HGV
Borrower, (b) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any related flex provisions) or on other terms that would not reasonably be expected to materially delay (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability of HGV Borrower, from a conditionality and enforceability perspective, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) consummate the Committed Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent shall give the
Seller Representative prompt notice (and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days following) (i) of any actual breach or default under the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Parent or HGV Borrower becomes aware and (ii) of any termination, repudiation, rescission, cancellation or expiration of the

otherwise expand any condition to draw and other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof at the Closing. Parent and

Document or the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in a manner that (i) would prevent or materially delay the timing of the funding of the commitments
thereunder or make the timely funding of the Committed Debt Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Committed Debt Financing
materially less likely to occur or (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. “Commercially Reasonable Terms” means debt
financing terms available in the market from major international financing institutions to borrowers or issuers with credit ratings comparable to Parent
(determined giving pro forma effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for financing comparable to the type of financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter at the time the Alternative Financing is sought. As applicable, references in the Agreement (other than with respect to the
representations in this Agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub that speak as of the date hereof) to (i) Committed Debt Financing shall include
Alternative Financing and (ii) Debt Documents shall include definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative Financing.

(a) Straddle Period Taxes. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of the Company Entities based upon or measured by net
income or gain which relate to the Pre-Locked Box Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on
the Locked Box Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any “controlled foreign corporation” (within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code),
“passive foreign investment company” (within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code), or partnership or other pass-through entity in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate at such time); provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Locked Box Date, on the one hand, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Locked Box
Date, on the other hand, in proportion to the number of days in such Straddle Period included in the portion ending on the Locked Box Date and the
number of days in such Straddle Period included in the portion beginning after the Locked Box Date. The amount of Taxes of the Company Entities other
than Taxes based upon or measured by net income or gain for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Locked Box Tax Period will be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the taxable period
ending on the Locked Box Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.
(b) Transfer Tax. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Parent. Parent shall file all necessary Tax
Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the other parties hereto will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns, and
any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with filing such Tax Returns shall be borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent
(50%) by Parent.
(c) Plan of Reorganization. The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub hereby adopt this Agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).
(d) Intended Tax Treatment. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the parties or their respective Affiliates shall knowingly take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably
be expected to prevent qualification for such treatment. Each party shall, unless otherwise required by a final determination within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar state, local or non-U.S. final determination) or a change in applicable Law, or based on a change in the facts
and circumstances underlying the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the terms described in this Agreement, cause all Tax Returns to be
filed on a basis of treating the Merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall execute and
deliver officer’s certificates containing customary representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by counsel to Parent and/or
counsel to the Company in connection with the delivery of any opinion by such counsel with respect to the tax treatment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, including in connection with the filing of the Proxy Statement.
(e) Tax Proceedings; Cooperation. Parent shall notify the Seller Representative within ten (10) Business Days of receiving notice from a Taxing
Authority of a deficiency, audit, examination, claim, litigation or other administrative or court proceeding, suit or dispute with respect to Taxes relating to a
Pre-Locked Box Tax Period with respect to the Company Entities (a “Tax Proceeding”); provided that any delay or failure to provide such notice shall not
limit the obligations of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent any of the
 
A-84Table of Contents
Sellers are actually and materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Tax Proceeding, such material facts
and information as are then reasonably available, including any material written correspondence from or to the relevant Taxing Authority. In the case of a
Tax Proceeding with respect to Taxes for which the Sellers are reasonably expected to have an indemnification obligation under Section 8.2(e), Parent and
the Seller Representative shall jointly control and participate in any such Tax Proceeding and shall keep each other reasonably informed of the status of
any such Tax Proceeding; provided, that, neither Parent nor the Seller Representative shall compromise or settle any such dispute without first obtaining
the prior written consent of the Seller Representative or Parent, as applicable, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The rights of the Sellers with respect to any Tax Proceeding shall be subject to any rights of the insurer with respect to such Tax Proceeding pursuant to
the R&W Policy, unless the Seller Representative agrees that the Sellers will be fully liable for any Losses resulting from such Tax Proceeding,
notwithstanding any portion of this Section 6.19(e) to the contrary. Parent, the Company Entities and each of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Seller Representative, on the other hand, shall cooperate with respect to any Tax Proceeding, other Tax claim, and the filing of Tax Returns
(including related to the Accounting Method Change), which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting
party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Proceeding, Tax claim or Tax Return, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to
such Tax Proceeding, Tax claim or Tax Return to the extent reasonably required. Parent and the Seller Representative shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and other documents as are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 6.19(e). The provisions of this Section 6.19(e),
and not Section 8.4(b), shall govern the procedures between Parent and the Sellers relating to any Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the
control of the Accounting Method Change shall be governed by Section 6.19(i).
(f) Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and each Company
Entity for all Pre-Locked Box Tax Periods that are due after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with existing
procedures, practices, and accounting methods of the Company and each Company Entity, unless otherwise required by applicable Law; provided that
Parent may at its election take on any such Tax Return a Tax position inconsistent with existing procedures, practices and accounting methods, but if
Parent makes such election, it shall not be entitled to make an indemnification claim for any incremental Taxes resulting from such Tax position pursuant
to Section 8.2(e). Each such Tax Return shall be submitted to the Seller Representative, for the Seller Representative’s review and comment (i) in the case
of any income Tax Return, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such income Tax Return (taking into account extensions) and (ii) in the case of
any other material Tax Return, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the due date of such Tax Return (taking into account extensions). If the Seller
Representative disputes any item on any such Tax Return, it shall notify Parent of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for their objection within
ten (10) days of their receipt of such Tax Return and Parent shall consider any reasonable comments of the Seller Representative in good faith. Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Entities) to, take any action outside the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date after the Closing. The parties hereto agree that any deductions for U.S. federal income Tax purposes attributable to the
Transaction Expenses (without taking into account the penultimate sentence of the “Transaction Expenses” definition) or Option Consideration (without
taking into account clause (iii) of the “Option Consideration” definition) shall be attributable to the taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the
Closing Date to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
(g) Pre-Closing Restructuring. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to Closing, the Company and Sellers shall, and
shall cause the Company Entities to, take all actions and do all things necessary, proper or advisable under Law to effect the transactions set forth on
Schedule 6.19(g) in all material respects in the manner set forth therein. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide
Parent with all agreements, resolutions, consents and other written actions as may be required to effectuate the transactions set forth on Schedule 6.19(g)
for Parent’s reasonable review and comment and shall
 
A-85
Table of Contents
revise such agreements, resolutions and other written actions in accordance with any reasonable comments that Parent provides with respect thereto.
(h) Tax Refunds. The Sellers shall be entitled to all refunds (or any credits in lieu thereof), if any, along with any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto, that are received by Parent, any of the Company Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates following the Closing and that are
attributable to Taxes paid by the Company Entities with respect to any Pre-Locked Box Tax Period, in each case, other than (i) refunds or credits included
in the Locked Box Balance Sheet or taken into account in the final determination of Indebtedness, (ii) Transfer Taxes borne by Parent pursuant to
Section 6.19(b), or (iii) any refund or credit resulting from a carry back of a Tax attribute attributable to a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Locked Box Date. If Parent, any of the Company Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates receives such a Tax refund (or a credit in lieu thereof), it
will deliver the same, net of any Taxes or reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent, the Company Entities, or any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to such refund (or credit in lieu thereof), to the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) within a reasonable period
of time after receipt thereof, but in no event shall be required to make such payments on more than two occasions in any taxable year. Nothing in this
Section 6.19(h) shall require Parent, the Company, any Company Entity or any of their respective Affiliates thereof to make any payment with respect to
any Tax refund (and such refund shall be for the benefit of Parent) that is with respect to any refund resulting from the payment of Taxes made on or after
the Locked Box Date to the extent the Sellers have not borne such Tax or otherwise have not indemnified Parent for such Taxes. Parent, the Company
Entities and any of their respective Affiliates shall have the right to withhold and set-off against any amounts due to the Sellers under this Section 6.19(h)
an amount equal to the amount of any claim for indemnification for which the Sellers may be liable pursuant to Section 8.2(e) that has not been finally
resolved or to the extent any such claim has not been paid in full; provided, that, Parent, the Company Entities and their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, shall promptly deliver to the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) any such amounts withheld to the extent it is ultimately determined
that the Sellers are not liable under Section 8.2(e) for such amounts withheld.
(i) Control over Accounting Methods Change. Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company shall control the Accounting
Method Change; provided that the Company shall (i) consult in good faith with Parent with respect to the Accounting Method Change and not take any
material action with respect to the Accounting Method Change without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed of the progress of the Accounting Method Change, including by promptly
providing Parent and its Affiliates with copies of all correspondence with the IRS and material third-party correspondence relating to such application.
Following the Closing, Parent shall be entitled to control the Accounting Method Change and none of the Sellers shall have any rights with respect
thereto.
(j) Limitation on Actions. Without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), and except to the extent required by applicable Law, Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and the Company Entities) to, initiate, pursue or enter into any voluntary disclosure programs, voluntary compliance programs, or
other similar programs or agreements with the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to any Pre-Locked Box Tax Period, in each case, if it can be
reasonably expected that such action could result in an indemnification obligation under Section 8.2(e); provided, however, that Parent may at its election
take any such action, but if Parent makes such election, it shall not be entitled to make an indemnification claim for any incremental Taxes resulting from
such action pursuant to Section 8.2(e). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.19(j) shall in no way limit Parent’s rights pursuant to
Section 6.19(i) related to the Accounting Method Change. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including Section 6.19(f) and this
Section 6.19(j)), Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the Company Entities) shall be permitted to file a Tax Return
inconsistent with existing procedures, policies and practices of the Company and the other Company Entities (including filing in a jurisdiction where a
Company Entity has not previously filed) or take any action described in this Section 6.19(j), in each case with respect to any taxable

period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Locked Box Date, and no such action shall impact any right of Parent to be indemnified for Taxes
attributable to Pre-Locked Box Tax Periods pursuant to Section 8.2(e).
(k) Reverence Pre-Closing Reorganization. Prior to the Closing, each of RCP Investor 1, RCP Investor 3, RCP Investor 5 and RCP Investor 6 shall use
reasonable best efforts to transfer all of its Company Shares to one or more entities that shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent a valid and duly
executed IRS Form W-9 pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iv).",344,347

(a) Unless otherwise agreed between any Continuing Employee and Parent and subject to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement which
covers any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide (i) from and after the Closing Date until
the first anniversary thereof (or earlier cessation of employment, as applicable), a base salary or base wages to each Continuing Employee at a rate that is
no less than the annual rate of the base salary or base wages that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) from
and after the Closing Date until December 31 of the year in which the Closing occurs (or earlier cessation of employment, as applicable), target annual
cash bonus opportunity to each Continuing Employee that is no less than the target annual cash bonus opportunity that was provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) from and after the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof (or earlier cessation of
employment, as applicable), other employee benefits (but excluding any change of control, sale, retention or similar bonus arrangements, long-term
incentive cash bonus opportunity or equity or equity-linked compensation) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to, in Parent’s sole discretion,
either (x) the other employee benefits (but excluding any change of control, sale, retention or similar bonus arrangements, long-term incentive cash bonus
opportunity or equity or equity-linked compensation) provided to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
Date or (y) the other employee benefits (but excluding any change of control, sale, retention or similar bonus arrangements, long-term incentive cash
bonus opportunity or equity or equity-linked compensation) provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (excluding any such
benefits that similarly-situated employees of Parents and its Subsidiaries become entitled to as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement). Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
terminating the employment of any employee at any time on or after the Closing or require any payment of compensation or provision of benefits to such
person thereafter.
(b) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the service of each Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date to be taken into account
for all purposes, including of participation, eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits), as applicable, under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and each of its Subsidiaries) (it being understood that, for the avoidance of
doubt, such service credit shall not entitle any Continuing Employee to benefits under any frozen employee benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and each of its Subsidiaries)), to the same extent as such service was taken into
account under corresponding plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such purposes; provided that such crediting of service need only be taken
into account to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was taken into account under the corresponding benefit plan and shall not
(i) result, or require any action that would result, in the duplication of any benefits or (ii) be provided for any newly-established employee benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates for which similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates do not receive past service
credit. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall waive, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third-party insurer to waive, any pre-
existing condition or limitation for each Continuing Employee under any health or welfare plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries) for any condition for which such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding plan of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) If requested by Parent in a written notice delivered to the Company not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company
shall cause the board of directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) of the Company or its Subsidiary to adopt resolutions and take such corporate
actions as are necessary to terminate the Diamond Resorts 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”), effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date. If the Company 401(k) Plan shall be terminated as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent (i) executed resolutions of the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) authorizing
the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing and (ii) an
executed copy of the amendment made to the Company 401(k) Plan in connection with such termination of the Company 401(k) Plan. Prior to the
execution of any required resolutions or amendments in connection with the foregoing sentence, the Company shall provide drafts of such resolutions
and amendments for Parent’s reasonable review and comment. In the event that the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as set forth in this Section 6.20(c)
with respect to each Continuing Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause a
Parent Plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) to permit and accept
rollover contributions of the account balances of such Continuing Employee and (ii) cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to permit and accept as rollover
contributions a maximum of two (2) outstanding loan notes made by such Continuing Employee that are held as assets of the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing, and if the Parent 401(k) Plan permits and accepts as a rollover contribution such loan notes, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit the Continuing Employee who made such loan note to continue to repay the underlying loan in accordance with
its terms in effect immediately prior to the Closing.
(d) Before the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek, prior to the initiation of the approval by the Company
Stockholders described in the next sentence, from each Person to whom any payment or benefit is required or proposed to be made that could constitute
“parachute payments” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, a written agreement waiving such Person’s right to receive some or all of such payment or
benefit (such amounts, the “Waived Benefits”), to the extent necessary so that all remaining payments and benefits applicable to such Person shall not
be deemed a parachute payment, and accepting in substitution for the Waived Benefits, the right to receive the Waived Benefits only if approved by the
Company Stockholders in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code (the “280G Stockholder Vote”). Before the Effective Time, with
respect to each “disqualified individual” (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) (each, a “Disqualified Individual”) from which the Company has
obtained any necessary waivers and consents, the Company will take all necessary actions to submit for approval by the Company Stockholders, in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code, the right of each such Disqualified Individual to receive or retain, as applicable, that portion of any

(a) In order for a Parent Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the “Indemnified Party”) to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement as a result of a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a “Third Party Claim”), such Indemnified Party
shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the “Indemnifying Party”) (which notice, in any case where any Seller is an
Indemnifying Party, shall be sent to the Seller Representative unless a claim is made hereunder with respect to which only the Reverence Sellers would,
pursuant to the proviso set forth in Section 8.2, have any liability, in which case the Reverence Sellers will be the “Indemnifying Party” hereunder)
promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure and
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise pursuant to this
Article VIII.
(b) Except with respect to claims for indemnification related to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 6.19(e), the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third
Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim for equitable or injunctive relief or any claim that would impose criminal liability or damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for the Indemnified Party, there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for the

reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and
make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party’s possession or under the
Indemnified Party’s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim that (i) involves a finding or admission of
wrongdoing or any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party, (ii) does not unconditionally release the
Indemnified Party of liability in connection with such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes any equitable or other non-monetary remedies or obligations on
the Indemnified Party, other than customary confidentially obligations.
(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that (i) does not involve a Third Party Claim
being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party or (ii) is a claim related to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 6.19(e),
the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the Indemnifying Party.",353,354

in actual cash Taxes paid by the Indemnified Party in the year of the Loss giving rise to such indemnification claim, or in the taxable year
immediately following such year, and arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss.
(b) Parent and each applicable Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim, liability or Loss for which indemnification

(c) Each party hereto acknowledges and hereby agrees that the Financing Failure Fee is liquidated damages, and is agreed to be in a reasonable
amount that fully compensates the Company and its Affiliates in the circumstances in which it is payable, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. In furtherance thereof, the parties agree that the Financing Failure Fee, in the event such fee becomes due and payable in
accordance with this Agreement, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) available to the Seller
and the Company for all losses and damages in respect of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (or the failure of such transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether willful, intentional (including intentional
breach), unilateral or otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise or any oral representation made or alleged to be

Company, the Sellers nor any other Seller Related Party shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at
law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prejudice in any manner the Company’s rights to specific
performance pursuant to Section 10.12 prior to any such termination and payment of the Financing Failure Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, under no circumstances shall the Company or any Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the
Closing occurring and the Financing Failure Fee being paid. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the amount in each of Section 9.2(b)(i), Section 9.2(b)(ii) or Section 9.2(b)(iii), as the case may be, on more than one (1) occasion even if such fee may be
payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same time or at different times and/or upon the occurrence of different events.
(d) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. If Parent fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 9.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Seller Representative, any of the Sellers and/or the Company, as applicable,
commences a suit that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 9.2(b)(i), Section 9.2(b)(ii) or
Section 9.2(b)(iii), or any portion thereof, Parent shall also pay to the Sellers and/or the Company, as applicable, its reasonable and documented out-of-

funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made under this Section 9.2(d).

pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such party and its stockholders.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.12 or otherwise in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby agree that the Sellers

(a) From and after the Effective Date, subject to the terms and conditions of this Article II, Apollo shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to designate, and the individuals nominated for election as Directors by or at the direction of the Board or a duly-authorized committee thereof
shall include, two (2) individuals who meet the Designee Qualifications to serve as Directors; provided, that as long as the Apollo Parties, in the
aggregate, Beneficially Own at least [                ]2 of the Apollo Closing Shares, if the Total Number of Directors is eleven (11) or more, then Apollo shall be
entitled to designate one (1) additional individual who meets the Designee Qualifications for each three (3) Directors in excess of nine (9) Directors. The
Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that each of the individuals set forth on Schedule 2.1(a) meets the Designation Qualifications to serve

as a Director (the “Pre-Qualified Apollo Designees”) as of the date of this Agreement and, subject to confirmation from each Pre-Qualified Apollo
Designee that each such Person continues to meet the Designee Qualifications at such time, immediately prior to any such person being designated to
serve as a Director, as of the Effective Time.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Total Number of Directors is increased and such increase correspondingly results in increase in the
number of Directors that Apollo is entitled to designate in accordance to Section 2.1(a) and then subsequently reduced, the number of individuals that
Apollo is entitled to designate pursuant to Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically reduced to the number of individuals that Apollo would otherwise be
entitled to designate pursuant to Section 2.1(a); provided, that, if the Total Number of Directors is thereafter increased again, the number of designees
shall increase in accordance with Section 2.1(a). The foregoing right of Apollo to designate additional Apollo Designees in the event the Total Number of
Directors increases in accordance Section 2.1(a) is referred to as the “Apollo Designee Step-Up Right.” For the avoidance of any doubt, the Apollo
Designee Step-Up Right shall terminate immediately when Apollo no longer Beneficially Owns at least [            ] of the Apollo Closing Shares.3
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 2.1(a), the number of individuals that Apollo is entitled to designate to serve as
Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be reduced to: (i) one (1) director if, at any time, Apollo Parties, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own at least [            ]
of the Apollo Closing Shares but less than [            ] of the Apollo Closing Shares4; and (ii) no Directors if, at any time, the Apollo Parties, in the
aggregate, Beneficially Own less than [            ] of the Apollo Closing Shares5. Any step-down reductions in the number of individuals that Apollo is
entitled to designate to serve as Directors pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence or Section 2.1(b) is referred to in either case hereinafter as the
“Board Stepdown.”
(d) If at any time Apollo has designated fewer than the total number of individuals that Apollo is then entitled to designate pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), Apollo shall have the right (but not the obligation) to designate such number of additional individuals who meet the Designee
Qualifications that Apollo is entitled to designate, in which case, any individuals nominated by or at the direction of the Board or any duly-authorized
committee thereof for election as Directors to fill any vacancy or newly created directorships on the Board shall include such designees, and the
Company shall use its best efforts to effect the election of such additional designees, whether by increasing the size of the Board, causing the election of
such additional designees to fill any vacancies, or otherwise. Each such individual whom Apollo shall actually designate pursuant to this Section 2.1 and
who qualifies to serve and is thereafter elected as a Director shall be referred to herein as an “Apollo Designee”.
(e) Subject to the terms of this Section 2.1 and Section 2.5, Apollo shall have the exclusive right to remove, whether with or without cause,
any Apollo Designee at any time; provided, that Apollo shall provide at least five (5) Business Days’ notice of any such removal, which notice shall
include the reason for removal and any other information required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5.02 of Form 8-K. Subject to the provisions of this
Article II, including the qualification provisions in Section 2.3, Apollo shall also have the right to replace any Apollo Designee. In the event that a
vacancy is created at any time by the death, disability, retirement, removal or resignation of any Apollo Designee, except in the case of vacancy resulting
from, or related to, the Board Stepdown, any individual nominated or appointed by or at the direction of the Board or any duly-authorized committee
thereof to fill such vacancy shall be, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such vacancy to be filled by, a new designee of
Apollo who meets the Designee Qualifications, and the Company and the Board shall take, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, at any time and from
time to time, all actions necessary to accomplish the same as soon as possible following such designation.

Board, must be willing to be interviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the same basis as any other new or returning, as
applicable, candidate for appointment or election to the Board and must be reasonably satisfactory to the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee acting in good faith. Apollo, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, on behalf of itself and other Apollo Parties, and each Apollo
Designee, shall deliver such questionnaires and otherwise provide such information as are reasonably requested by the Company in connection with

(b) Until Apollo either no longer has any rights under Section 2.1 to designate any Apollo Designee to serve on the Board or Apollo
irrevocably waives any such rights in writing, the Company shall not amend the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any other organizational

such offering, a “Private Placement”), the Company shall provide Apollo with written notice (an “Issuance Notice”) of such New Issuance at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the issuance of such New Securities. The Issuance Notice shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the New
Issuance, including (i) the proposed number of New Securities if known or, if not known, an estimate thereof, (ii) a description of the New Securities and
proposed manner of sale, (iii) the purchase price per New Security (or conversion price or premium in the event of an offering of convertible debt) (the
“Per Security Offering Price”) if known or, if not known, an estimate thereof, and (iv) the proposed issuance date if known or, if not known, an estimate

Transferees), at the Per Security Offering Price and on the other terms and conditions specified in the Issuance Notice, up to the number of such New
Securities that would result in the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock that is Beneficially Owned in the aggregate by

that was Beneficially Owned in the aggregate by all Apollo Entities immediately prior to such New Issuance, provided that for this purpose such
percentage shall not exceed the Sell-Down Level Ownership Percentage (such percentage, the “Pro Rata Portion”). For purposes of this Section 4.1(c), in
calculating the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock that is Beneficially Owned in the aggregate by all Apollo Entities,
the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as disclosed in the most recent SEC filing of the Company shall be used.
(b) In order for Apollo to exercise its rights under this Section 4.2, it must deliver written notice of its election to purchase (either directly or
through any other Apollo Parties or any of Apollo’s Controlled Affiliates that are Permitted Transferees) such New Securities to the Company within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of the Issuance Notice, which notice shall specify the number of New Securities requested to be purchased by Apollo.
Delivery of such notice shall constitute a binding commitment of Apollo to purchase (either directly or through any other Apollo Parties or any of
Apollo’s Controlled Affiliates that are Permitted Transferees) the amount of New Securities so specified at a price no greater than the Per Security

number of New Securities that Apollo (and any other Apollo Parties and any of Apollo’s Controlled Affiliates that are Permitted Transferees) shall be
entitled to purchase in connection with such New Issuance pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be reduced proportionately and Apollo’s notice delivered
pursuant to Section 4.2(b) shall be deemed amended to reflect such reduction. If the number of New Securities is reduced as contemplated by this
Section 4.2(d), the Company shall not issue or sell the remainder of the New Securities described in the Issuance Notice without again complying with the
provisions of this Section 4.2.

any Private Placement in which any of them has elected to purchase New Securities pursuant to this Section 4.2, execute and deliver all such documents
and instruments as are customarily required in connection with such an offering, including, without limitation, customary investment representations and
representations as to its status as the type of offeree to whom a private sale may be made pursuant to the Securities Act, and any failure to deliver or
enter into any such documents and instruments at or prior to such closing shall constitute a waiver of the right of first refusal set forth in this Section 4.2
with respect to such New Issuance.

(a) Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 4.1, after the Restricted Period (or earlier if the Company agrees to waive the
Restricted Period), if the Company proposes to register Common Stock for public sale, whether or not for its own account, under the Securities Act (other
than a registration on Form S-4 or S-8, or any successor or other forms promulgated for similar purposes) in a manner which would permit registration of
Registrable Securities for sale to the public under the Securities Act, it shall, at each such time, give prompt written notice (which notice shall be given
not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the filing by the Company with the SEC of any registration statement with respect thereto and shall specify
the intended method or methods of disposition and the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be registered) to the Apollo Parties and the
Reverence Persons of its intention to do so and of Apollo Parties’ and Reverence Persons’ rights under this Section 5.1. Upon the written request of the
Apollo Parties or the Reverence Persons made within five (5) Business days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number
of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by the Apollo Parties or the Reverence Persons, as applicable), the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Apollo Parties and/or the Reverence Persons have so
requested to be registered;
 
B-19Table of Contents
provided that: (i) an Apollo Party and a Reverence Person shall have the right to withdraw its request for inclusion of any of such Registrable Securities
in any registration statement pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) by giving written notice to the Company of such withdrawal, provided, that, in the case of
any underwritten offering, written notice of such withdrawal must be given to the Company prior to the time at which the offering price or underwriter’s
discount is determined with the managing underwriter or underwriters; (ii) if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register Common
Stock and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason
not to proceed with the proposed registration of Common Stock to be sold by it, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to the Apollo Parties and the Reverence Persons and, thereupon, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such registration without prejudice to the rights of the Apollo Parties to request that such registration be effected as a
registration under Section 5.2(a); and (iii) subject to clause (i), if such registration involves an underwritten offering, any Person requesting to be included
in the registration must, upon the written request of the Company, sell its Registrable Securities to the underwriters on the same terms and conditions as
apply to the other Equity Securities being sold through underwriters under such registration, with, in the case of a combined primary and secondary
offering, only such differences, including any with respect to representations and warranties, indemnification and liability insurance, as may be
customary or appropriate in combined primary and secondary offerings.
(b) Expenses. The Company shall pay all of its Registration Expenses in connection with each registration of Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 5.1 and the preparation of the registration statement; provided that (x) the Apollo Parties shall pay (i) any underwriting discounts,
commissions or fees relating to the Registrable Securities that are sold by such Apollo Parties, (ii) transfer taxes with respect to the Registrable Securities
that are sold by such Apollo Parties, (iii) SEC registration fees and stock exchange listing fees for the Registrable Securities that are sold by such Apollo
Parties and (iv) the fees and expenses of legal counsel retained by the Apollo Parties and (y) the Reverence Persons shall pay (i) any underwriting
discounts, commissions or fees relating to the Registrable Securities that are sold by such Reverence Persons, (ii) transfer taxes with respect to the
Registrable Securities that are sold by such Reverence Persons, (iii) SEC registration fees and stock exchange listing fees for the Registrable Securities
that are sold by such Reverence Persons and (iv) the fees and expenses of legal counsel retained by the Reverence Persons.
(c) Priority in Piggyback Registrations. If a registration pursuant to this Section 5.1 involves an underwritten offering and the managing
underwriter advises the Company in writing (a copy of which shall be provided to the Apollo Parties and the Reverence Persons) that, in its good faith
opinion, the number of Registrable Securities and other Equity Securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be
sold in such offering, so as to be likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of Common Stock offered in such offering, then the
Company shall include in such registration: (i) first, Common Stock the Company proposes to sell for its own account; and (ii) second, such number of
Registrable Securities requested by the Apollo Parties and the Reverence Persons to be included in such registration which, in the opinion of such
managing underwriter, can be sold without having the adverse effect referred to above, which number of Registrable Securities shall be allocated pro rata
among all holders of Registrable Securities based on the number of Registrable Securities each has requested to be so included (subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by the Company of the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 4.1).
(d) Excluded Transactions. The Company shall not be obligated to effect any registration of Registrable Securities under this Section 5.1
incidental to the registration of any of its Securities in connection with:
(i) a registration statement filed to cover issuances under employee benefits plans or dividend reinvestment plans;
(ii) any registration statement relating solely to the acquisition or merger after the date hereof by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of or with any other businesses, assets or properties;
 
B-20

(iii) any registration statement covering securities other than shares of the same class as those held by the Apollo Parties (even if
such securities are convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares that are registered as part of such offering); or
(iv) any registration related solely to an exchange by the Company or its Subsidiaries of their own securities.
(e) Shelf Takedowns. In connection with any shelf takedown (whether pursuant to Section 5.2(f) or at the initiative of the Company), the
Reverence Persons may, and if after the Restricted Period, the Apollo Parties may, exercise “piggyback” rights in the manner described in this Agreement
to have included in such takedown Registrable Securities held by them that are registered on such shelf registration statement, provided, that in the case
of any shelf takedown for an underwritten offering, at the initiative of the Company, the ten (10) Business Day period in Section 5.1(a) shall be reduced to

(a) General. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 4.1, after the Restricted Period (or earlier if the Company agrees to waive
the Restricted Period), upon the written request of any Apollo Party (the “Demand Party”) requesting that the Company effect the registration under the
Securities Act of Registrable Securities and specifying the amount and intended method of disposition thereof (including, but not limited to, an
underwritten public offering), the Company shall (i) promptly give written notice of such requested registration to the Seller Parties and any other holders
of securities entitled to notice of such registration, and (ii) as expeditiously as possible (and in any event within forty five (45) days if the Company is
eligible to use Form S-3), use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement to effect the registration under the Securities Act of:
(i) such Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Demand Party in accordance with the
intended method of disposition thereof; and
(ii) subject to the consent of the Demand Party, the Registrable Securities of the Seller Parties and any other holders of securities
which the Company has been requested to register by written request given to the Company within five (5) Business Days after the giving of such
written notice by the Company.
The Company shall be required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement with respect to any Demand Registration for a period of at least
180 calendar days after the effective date thereof or such shorter period during which all Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
have actually been sold; provided, however, that such period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the holder of Registrable Securities
refrains from selling any securities included in such Registration Statement at the request of the Company or an underwriter of the Company pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to file a registration statement relating to any registration request under this
Section 5.2(a):
(x) within a period of ninety (90) days (or such lesser period as the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering may permit)
after the effective date of any other registration statement relating to any registration request under this Section 5.2(a) or relating to any registration
referred to in Section 5.1; provided, that if greater than 50% of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered pursuant to Section 5.1 or
Section 5.2(a) by the Apollo Parties taken as a whole are excluded from the applicable registration pursuant to Section 5.1(c) or Section 5.2(e), the Apollo
Parties shall have the right, with respect to such excluded Registrable Securities, to request one (1) additional registration pursuant to Section 5.2(a)
within one-hundred (100) days after such ninety (90) day period; or
(y) if, in the good faith judgment of a majority of the disinterested members of the Board, the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of the registration statement would be adverse to the Company
 
B-21Table of Contents
because (i) such action would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or (ii) the Board has determined in good faith that the registration or
sale of the Registrable Securities would be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect a planned bona fide financing of the Company that is
reasonably likely to be promptly initiated by the Company, then the Company may delay the filing (but not the preparation of) or initial effectiveness of,
or suspend use of, the registration statement (a “Demand Suspension”); provided, that the Company shall not be permitted to exercise more than two
(2) Demand Suspensions during any twelve-(12) month period for more than an aggregate of ninety (90) days; and provided, further, that in the event of a
Demand Suspension, such Demand Suspension shall terminate at such time as the Company would no longer be required to make any Adverse
Disclosure or any such planned financing has been abandoned or completed.
(b) Form. Each registration statement prepared at the request of a Demand Party shall be effected on such form as reasonably requested by
the Demand Party, including by a shelf registration pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act on a Form S-3 (or any successor rule or form thereto) if
so requested by the Demand Party and if the Company is then eligible to effect a shelf registration and use such form for such disposition.
(c) Expenses. The Demand Party shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each registration of Registrable Securities requested
pursuant to this Section 5.2. Any such expenses that are initially billed to and paid by the Company on behalf of the Demand Party shall be due and
payable upon request at such time or times designated by the Company. For the avoidance doubt, the Demand Party shall also be responsible for (i) any
underwriting discounts, commissions or fees relating to the Registrable Securities that are sold by such Demand Party and any Seller Party, (ii) transfer
taxes with respect to the Registrable Securities that are sold by such Demand Party and any Seller Party, (iii) SEC registration fees and stock exchange
listing fees for the Registrable Securities that are sold by such Demand Party and any Seller Party and (iv) the fees and expenses of legal counsel retained
by such Demand Party and any Seller Party; provided, however, that the Demand Party shall not be responsible for the taxes, fees and expenses referred
in the forgoing clauses relating to the securities to be sold by any other holders who participate in the registration.
(d) Plan of Distribution, Underwriters and Counsel. If a requested registration pursuant to this Section 5.2 involves an underwritten
offering, the Demand Party shall have the right to (i) determine the plan of distribution, (ii) select the investment banker or bankers and managers to
administer the offering, including the lead managing underwriter (provided that such investment banker or bankers and managers shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company) and (iii) select primary counsel for all of the selling holders; provided, that nothing in this subsection (iii) shall prevent the
Company from hiring its own counsel (at the expense of the Demand Party) in connection with the preparation of the registration statement.
(e) Priority in Demand Registrations. If a requested registration pursuant to this Section 5.2 involves an underwritten offering and the
managing underwriter advises the Company in writing (a copy of which shall be provided to the Apollo Parties) that, in its good faith opinion, the number
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering, so as to be likely to have
an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities offered in such offering, then the number of such Registrable Securities
to be included in such registration shall be allocated (i) first, the Registrable Securities held by the Apollo Parties (pro rata among (x) Registrable
Securities held by the Demand Party, and (y) the Registrable Securities held by any other Apollo Party that is an original party to this Agreement that has
requested that their Registrable Securities be sold pursuant to Section 5.1(a), if any, on the basis of the relative number of securities requested to be
included in such registration by the Demand Party and such other Apollo Party) and the Seller Parties on a pro rata basis; and (ii) second, shares of
Common Stock requested to be included in such Demand Registration to be sold by any other selling holders of Common Stock. Any other selling
holders of Common Stock will be included in an underwritten offering only with the consent of the Demand Party.
(f) Shelf Takedowns. Upon the written request of the Demand Party, the Company shall file and seek the effectiveness of a shelf registration
statement, or a post-effective amendment to an existing shelf registration
 
B-22
Table of Contents
statement, in order to register a number of securities sufficient to cover the Demand Party’s Registrable Securities. Upon the written request of the
Demand Party at any time and from time to time, the Company shall facilitate in the manner described in this Agreement a “takedown” of the Demand
Party’s Registrable Securities off of an effective shelf registration statement. Upon the written request of the Demand Party, the Company shall file and
seek the effectiveness of a post-effective amendment to an existing shelf registration statement in order to register up to the number of the Demand
Party’s Registrable Securities previously taken down off of such shelf by the Demand Party and not yet “reloaded” onto such shelf registration
statement.
(g) Additional Rights. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights
granted to the Apollo Parties in this Agreement or grant any additional registration rights to any Person or with respect to any securities that are not
Registrable Securities that adversely affects the priorities of the Apollo Parties pursuant to Section 5.1(c) or 5.2(e) of this Agreement.
(h) Number of Demands. The Apollo Parties shall be entitled to a maximum of six (6) demand registrations (including shelf “takedowns”) for

Securities until its receipt of the copies of the amended or supplemented prospectus contemplated by Section 5.3(f) or until it is advised in writing (the
“Advice”) by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed and, if so directed by the Company, such Apollo Party will deliver to the

prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company gives any such notice, the period
for which the Company shall be required to keep the registration statement effective shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and
including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 5.3(l)(iv) to and including the date when such stop order, other order or suspension is

(i) Each Apollo Party will, in connection with any underwritten offering of Common Stock (whether for the Company’s account or for
the account of any other holder of Common Stock with registration rights, if any), upon the request of the underwriters managing such offering, agree to
be bound by customary lock-up agreements providing that such Apollo Party will not effect any sale, disposition or distribution of Registrable Securities

partners, members or stockholders thereof or (B) transferring shares of Common Stock to an Affiliate; (2) any Transfer of shares of Common Stock in

provided that, in the case of clauses (1), (2) and (3), such Transfer is otherwise in compliance with applicable securities Laws and the Transfer restrictions
in Article IV of this Agreement; provided, further, that, in the case of subclause (B) of clause (1), each such Transferee agrees in writing to become

report under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

Hilton Grand Vacations Inc._20210621_DEFM14A_19358725_4243052.Pdf,Indemnification,"Indemnification
(a) Indemnification by the Company. In the event of any registration of any securities of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to
Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each holder who sells
Registrable Securities (a “Selling Holder”) covered by such registration statement, each Affiliate of such Selling Holder and their respective directors,
officers, employees, partners and equityholders (and the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and controlling Persons of any of the foregoing), each
other Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such Registrable Securities and each other Person, if any, who controls such
Selling Holder or any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, and “Indemnified Party” and collectively, the “Indemnified
Parties”), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, and reasonable and documented expenses to which such Indemnified
Party may become subject under the Securities Act,
 
B-27Table of Contents
common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, whether or not such
Indemnified Party is a party thereto) arise out of or are based upon: (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any registration statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document
(including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report;
(b) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made; or (c) any violation or alleged violation by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of any federal, state, foreign or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and relating
to action or inaction in connection with any such registration, disclosure document or related document or report, and the Company shall reimburse such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability,
action or proceeding; provided that the Company shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, in any such preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such Indemnified Party furnished to the Company by such Indemnified
Party expressly for use in the preparation thereof. Such indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of such Selling Holder or any Indemnified Party and will survive any termination of this Agreement.
(b) Indemnification by Selling Holders. The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration
statement filed in accordance with Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any
Selling Holder to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 5.5(a)) the Company or any prospective
underwriter, as the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers and controlling Persons, with respect to any untrue statement in
or omission from such registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement, if such
untrue statement or omission was made in conformity with written information with respect to such Selling Holder furnished to the Company by such
Selling Holder expressly for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement,
or a document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing. Such indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or any of the other sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or controlling Persons and will
survive the Transfer of such Registrable Securities by the Selling Holder. In no event shall the liability of any Selling Holder hereunder be greater in
amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification obligation.
(c) Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 5.5, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 5.5(a) or Section 5.5(b), except
to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an Indemnified
Party, unless in such Indemnified Party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in
respect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel selected by the holders of at least a majority of the securities included in the relevant
registration statement, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to
 
B-28
Table of Contents
assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If, in such Indemnified Party’s reasonable judgment, having
common counsel would result in a conflict of interest between the interests of such indemnified and indemnifying parties, then such Indemnified Party
may employ separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party to represent or defend such Indemnified Party in such action, it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party will not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at
any time for all such Indemnified Parties (and not more than one separate firm of local counsel at any time for all such Indemnified Parties) in such action.
No indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.
(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for hereunder from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder
in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein for reasons other than those described in the proviso in the first
sentence of Section 5.5(a), then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or Indemnified Parties, and the parties’
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party under this
Section 5.5(d) as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. In no event shall the liability of any Selling Holder
hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder upon the sale of the Registrable
Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation. Any obligation of Selling Holder to contribute pursuant to this Section 5.5(d) shall be several in
proportion to the amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5.5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
If indemnification is available under Section 5.5(a), the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each Indemnified Party to the full extent provided in
Section 5.5(a) without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or Indemnified Party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this
Section 5.5(d).
(e) Other Indemnification. Indemnification substantially similar to that specified in this Section 5.5 (with appropriate modifications) shall be
given by the Company and each Selling Holder with respect to any required registration or other qualification of such securities under any Law or with
any Governmental Authority other than as required by the Securities Act.
(f) Non-Exclusivity. The obligations of the parties under this Section 5.5 will be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise
have to any other party.

pledged Common Stock and depositing such pledged Common Stock in book entry form on the books of The Depository Trust Company (and providing

or any other materials typically provided by borrowers to lenders) that will not unreasonably disrupt the operation of the Company’s business. Anything

under such Permitted Loan and that the execution of such Permitted Loan and the terms thereof do not violate the terms of this Agreement and (ii) such
Apollo Party acknowledges and agrees that the Company will be relying on such certificate when entering into the Issuer Agreement and any inaccuracy
in such certificate will be deemed a breach of this Agreement. The Apollo Parties acknowledge and agree that the statements and agreements of the
Company in an Issuer Agreement are solely for the benefit of the applicable lenders party thereto and that in any dispute between the Company and the
Apollo Parties under this Agreement, the Apollo Parties shall not be entitled to use the statements and agreements of the Company in an Issuer
Agreement against the Company.
