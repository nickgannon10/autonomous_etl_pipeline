Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,The Special Meeting,"The Special Meeting
Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting
A special meeting of Cornerstone stockholders to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
will be held virtually on October 12, 2021, at 8:00 a.m. Pacific time at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CSOD2021SM (the “Special Meeting”).
At the Special Meeting, stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2021 (the “Record Date”)
will be asked to consider and vote on:
•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Cornerstone’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Compensation Proposal”);
and
•
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special
Meeting, and only matters specified in the notice of the meeting may be acted upon at the Special Meeting.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
You are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the
close of business on the Record Date. Each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each such
share of common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date on all matters properly coming before the
Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 66,857,760 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled vote
at the Special Meeting. A quorum is necessary to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Compensation
Proposal. A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the Special Meeting for the meeting to
be properly held under our bylaws and Delaware law. The holders of a majority of the common stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, present virtually in person or represented by proxy,
will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. Your shares of common stock will be counted towards the quorum
only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee), if you vote at the meeting or if you attend the Special Meeting
but abstain from voting. The Special Meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes",10,11
Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,"Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of
the close of business on the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the required vote for
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast
rather than on the number of votes actually cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy or vote online at the meeting
(including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as
votes cast “AGAINST” the merger proposal. As of August 24, 2021, the Record Date for the Special Meeting,
33,428,881 shares constitute a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Under our bylaws, approval of Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-
binding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder
abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement and “AGAINST” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the
Compensation Proposal. For stockholders who attend the virtual meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain
from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Adjournment
Proposal. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will also count as votes against such proposal.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will
have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs
when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,
broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.
“Broker non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However,
because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have
discretionary authority to vote, Cornerstone does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As such, if
you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted
towards a quorum at the Special Meeting.

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the

manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) will be canceled and cease to
exist and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $57.50, without interest (the
“Merger Consideration” or “Per Share Merger Consideration”), subject to any withholding of taxes required by

as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger-Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs
Cornerstone from time to time has granted awards under its equity incentive plans, of options to purchase shares of
Cornerstone common stock (each, a “Company Option”), and restricted stock units covering shares of Cornerstone
common stock (each, a “Company RSU”). The Merger Agreement provides that (i) each Company RSU that is
unexpired, unexercised, outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or that vests solely as a
result of the consummation of the Merger (each, a “Vested Company RSU”), (ii) each Company Option that is
unexpired, unexercised, outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or that vests solely as a
result of the consummation of the Merger (each, a “Vested Company Option”), and (iii) each Company RSU owned by
a non-employee member of Cornerstone’s Board of Directors (each, a “Director RSU”) will be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number
of shares subject to, or issuable in settlement of, such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B)
the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, for each Company Option, the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over such Company Option’s per share exercise price), subject to any required withholding of taxes
(each, a “Vested Award Cash-out Payment”). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Treatment of Company Options

each portion of a Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option” and
together with each Unvested Company RSU, an “Unvested Award”) will be cancelled and automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of
shares subject to such Unvested Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration (or, for each Unvested Company Option, the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over such Unvested Company Option’s per share exercise price) subject to any required withholding
of taxes (the “Unvested Consideration Amount”), which Unvested Consideration

Amount will be paid at the same time(s) that the Unvested Awards would have vested in accordance with their terms
and will remain subject to the holder of the Unvested Awards remaining in continuous service with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Merger Agreement) through each such vesting
date (except, that any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder’s
employment in connection with or following the Merger will continue to apply to the Unvested Consideration

and fair to, and in the best interests of, Cornerstone and its stockholders; (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be
governed by and effected in accordance with the DGCL; (iii) declared it advisable to enter into the Merger Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger; (iv) authorized
and approved the execution, delivery and performance by Cornerstone of the Merger Agreement, and the

and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
Prior to receipt of the required stockholder approval, under certain specified circumstances, the Board of Directors
may withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with Cornerstone’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to Cornerstone’s stockholders under applicable legal
requirements. However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation unless it
complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing Parent four
business days to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement or make another proposal (as defined in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The Board of
Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Change Recommendation”). The termination of the Merger
Agreement by Parent following the withdrawal by the Board of Directors of its recommendation that stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement will result in the payment by Cornerstone of the Company Termination Fee. The
termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company following the Board of Directors’ authorization for the
Company to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior
Offer (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned, “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-
Conduct of Business Pending the Merger-No Solicitation of Other Offers”) will result in the payment by Cornerstone
of the Company Termination Fee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned

officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, Cornerstone stockholders more

Merger and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was
aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that these interests existed at the time.
These interests include:
•
at the Effective Time of the Merger, each Company Option and Company RSU will receive the treatment
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Cornerstone’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs”;
•
continued eligibility of Cornerstone’s executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits
(including equity award vesting acceleration) under their change of control severance agreements with
Cornerstone, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-
Interests of Cornerstone’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Payments Upon Termination At

The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent
and Merger Sub have represented to Cornerstone that they will have available to them, together with Cornerstone’s
cash on hand, sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the Merger by
Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement. This includes funds needed to: (i) pay Cornerstone
stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their Cornerstone common stock, (ii) make payments
in respect of our outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs payable at the closing of the Merger pursuant
to the Merger Agreement and (iii) make payments of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger
pursuant to that certain Indenture, dated December 8, 2017 by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee, as amended (the “Indenture”), and the 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the
“Cornerstone Convertible Notes”) (collectively, the “Required Amounts”). We anticipate that the total amount of
funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, including to pay the Merger Consideration,
make the required payments with respect to Company Options and Company RSUs payable at Closing, repay the
Company’s outstanding indebtedness and to make payments required with respect to the Cornerstone Convertible
Notes, as well as to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing of the Merger by the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, will be approximately $5,300,000,000.
In connection with the financing of the Merger, Parent and/or Merger Sub has obtained debt and equity commitments
as described below. For more information, please refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-
Financing of the Merger.”

Appraisal Rights",17,18
Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Cornerstone stockholders who continuously hold
shares of Cornerstone common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and exercise, and do not effectively
withdraw, fail to perfect or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek
an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Court”) of the “fair value” of their shares of
Cornerstone common stock (exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any), as determined by the
court, as described further below in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed. The
amount determined to be fair value by the court will be determined as of the Effective Time and could be more than,
the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration for Cornerstone common stock. Voting “AGAINST” or
failing to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal
within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Cornerstone stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares
or who wish to preserve their rights to do so should review Annex D carefully and are encouraged to seek the advice
of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights since failure to timely and fully comply with the
procedures set forth therein will result in the loss of such rights.
To exercise appraisal rights, Cornerstone stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Cornerstone
before the stockholder vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; (ii) not
submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold
shares of Cornerstone common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other
procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court will
dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Cornerstone unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by
the Cornerstone stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described
in further detail in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex D to this
proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more

The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption, “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for shares of Cornerstone common stock in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to Cornerstone stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by each of our
stockholders that is a U.S. Holder generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger per share and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger by such stockholder. Backup
withholding taxes may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder
complies with certification procedures under the backup withholding rules.
A Cornerstone stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption, “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain
connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies
with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
Cornerstone stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Cornerstone stockholders should also consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under

No Solicitation of Other Offers
Under the Merger Agreement, during the period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement (the “Pre-Closing Period”), Cornerstone may not, among
other actions: (i) engage or continue any solicitation, knowing encouragement, knowing facilitation (including by
providing non-public information), discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or (ii) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate, induce, assist or
encourage (including by furnishing non-public information) any Acquisition Proposal or any Inquiry (as defined
below). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Pending the Merger-No Solicitation of Other Offers.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, under certain specified circumstances, from the date of the Merger
Agreement to the receipt of the required stockholder approval, if Cornerstone, its subsidiaries or any of their
representatives receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, which was made on or after the date of the
Merger Agreement and did not result from any breach of the non-solicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement
(other than unintentional and immaterial breach), Cornerstone and its representatives may take certain actions which
would otherwise be prohibited if, and only if, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Offer and the failure to take any such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable legal requirements.
If Cornerstone terminates the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a
Superior Offer, Cornerstone must pay a termination fee of $150,000,000 to Parent. For more information, please see the

requested in the “Guest Login” section. Guests will not have the ability to vote or ask questions at the Special
Meeting.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $57.50 in cash,
without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes required by applicable law, for each share of
common stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you are entitled to and have properly
exercised and not withdrawn, failed to perfect or otherwise lost your appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $5,750.00 in cash in exchange for
your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes required by applicable law. You will not
receive any shares of the capital stock in the Surviving Corporation.
Q:
What will holders of Company stock awards receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Effective as of the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU, Vested Company Option and Director RSU will be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares subject to such award, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, for
each Company Option, the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such Company Option’s
per share exercise price), subject to any required withholding of taxes.
Effective as of the Effective Time, each Unvested Award will be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive the Unvested Consideration Amount, which Unvested Consideration Amount will be made at
the same time(s) that the Unvested Awards would have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain
subject to the holder of the Unvested Awards remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through each such vesting date (except, that any terms and conditions
relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following
the Merger will continue to apply to the Unvested Consideration Amount).
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. In order to complete the merger, the
Company must obtain the stockholder approval described in this proxy statement, and the other closing
conditions under the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary
closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we
currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated during the second half of 2021, although the Company
cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Since the Merger is subject to a number of conditions,
the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Cornerstone will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and
registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified
circumstances, Cornerstone will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $150,000,000 upon the termination
of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption
of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fee.”
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding
as of the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed
proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote virtually in person at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Q:
Why are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Cornerstone to seek an advisory (non-binding)
vote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to certain of its executive officers in
connection with the Merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or
appropriate?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of
each of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, and the Adjournment Proposal. If you
fail to submit a proxy or to vote while virtually attending the Special Meeting, or if you vote “ABSTAIN,” or if
you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Compensation Proposal and Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Cornerstone. Therefore, if
the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under
the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Cornerstone’s executive officers in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q:
What is a “broker non-vote”?
A:
Under the rules of the Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for
customers have the authority to vote on “discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions
from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their
voting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of
Company common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of
Company common stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to generally as “broker non-votes.”
Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may
have discretionary authority to vote, the Company does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects
you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided
in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL. Under Delaware law, stockholders of record who continuously hold shares of Cornerstone common stock
through the Effective Time and do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to
seek appraisal of the “fair value” of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court if the Merger is completed.
Appraisal rights will only be available to stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a
written demand for an appraisal to Cornerstone prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
at the Special Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or
less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. For additional information, see
the section entitled “The Merger-Appraisal Rights.”

No. A letter of transmittal will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within three business days, after the
Effective Time, describing how you should surrender your shares of Company common stock for the per share
Merger Consideration. If your shares of Company common stock are held in “street name” by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
as to how to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares of Company common stock in exchange for the
per share Merger Consideration. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.
Q:
What should I do if I have lost my stock certificate?
A:
If you have lost your stock certificate, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at
(800) 522-6645 or web.queries@computershare.com to obtain replacement certificates.
Q:
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and
written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of common stock represented by such holder’s book-
entry shares for Merger Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before
the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Cornerstone in writing of
such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger consideration, if the Merger is
completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those
shares at the Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common
stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,
you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Cornerstone.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by
your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special
Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares virtually in
person at the Special Meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting in person.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting
electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will
be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your
shares of common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that
you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock virtually in person at the Special Meeting
even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote virtually in
person, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the
Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee,
you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Cornerstone; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually in person.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote virtually in person at the
Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Philip S.
Saunders, our chief executive officer, and Adam Weiss, our chief administrative officer and general counsel, are
the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of substitution and re-substitution.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting. Meeting if you obtain
a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal;
and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
If available, Cornerstone may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting.
Cornerstone intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC
following the Special Meeting. All reports that Cornerstone files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
Q:

stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:

•
risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key

as U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that, if the Merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential
long-term value of the successful execution of Cornerstone’s current strategy as an independent public
company;

Proposals during the Pre-Closing Period;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results
and business generally;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
•
risks related to the Merger diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business
operations;

•
risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed; and
•
risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the Merger, including the timing and receipt of
regulatory approvals from various governmental entities, including any conditions, limitations or
restrictions placed on these approvals, and the risk that one or more governmental entities may deny
approval.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the
information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including: (i) the information contained under this caption;

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (i) adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii)
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (iii) approve the Adjournment
Proposal.
We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special
Meeting, and only matters specified in the notice of the meeting may be acted upon at the Special Meeting.
Our stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement in order for the Merger to be
consummated. If our stockholders fail to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will not
be consummated. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we urge
you to read carefully in its entirety.",30,30

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal
executive offices located at 1601 Cloverfield Blvd., Suite 620 South, Santa Monica, California 90404, during regular
business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting and will be available electronically at
the Special Meeting.
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present virtually in person
or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were
66,857,760 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, meaning that 33,428,881
shares of common stock must be represented virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. In the
event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit
additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of
the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the Record Date, 33,428,881 shares constitute a
majority of the outstanding shares of common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a
condition to the Closing of the Merger.
Under our bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually
in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder
abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
Compensation Proposal. For stockholders who attend the virtual meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain
from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to
adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will
be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will also count as votes against
such proposal.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will
have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any Adjournment Proposal. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs
when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,
broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.
“Broker non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However,
because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have
discretionary authority to vote, Cornerstone does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As such, if
you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted
towards a quorum at the Special Meeting.
Shares Held by Cornerstone’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 3,026,135 shares of common stock, representing approximately 4.5% of the shares of common stock
outstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 7.5% of the shares of common stock outstanding when taking
into account Cornerstone options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers).
Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their respective shares
of common stock (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-
binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal, and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.",30,31

Control Number found next to the label “Control Number” on your proxy card voting instruction form, or in the email
sending you the Proxy Statement. If you attend the Special Meeting, and vote virtually in person, your vote will

proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually in person.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies
received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of
the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted:

a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee
for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote virtually in person at the Special Meeting if

Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Board of Directors, together with Cornerstone management, regularly reviews and assesses Cornerstone’s
performance, share price, risks, opportunities and strategy in light of the current business and economic
environment, as well as evolving industry dynamics, as they, individually and together, may affect Cornerstone’s
long-term strategic goals and plans. As a matter of practice, the Board of Directors and Cornerstone management,
together with their professional advisors, regularly review and evaluate a wide range of strategic opportunities for
business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives for Cornerstone, including
continuing as a standalone company, with a view to enhance stockholder value.
On February 2, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of
Cooley LLP (“Cooley”), Cornerstone’s outside legal counsel. Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed
with the Board of Directors preliminary financial results with respect to Cornerstone’s operations through the end of
fiscal year 2020. At the request of the Board of Directors, representatives of
26TABLE OF CONTENTS
Centerview then joined the meeting to review with the Board of Directors general market observations based on
recent trends and Cornerstone’s financial performance relative to other companies in the software industry in order to
inform the Board of Directors’ ongoing assessment of Cornerstone’s long-term strategic plan. The Board of Directors
invited representatives of Centerview to join the meeting based on their experience and reputation in the software
industry and their long-standing relationship with Cornerstone, including their work with Cornerstone in connection
with the acquisition of Saba the prior year. Discussion ensued with respect to opportunities and challenges
associated with executing on Cornerstone’s long-term strategic plan and other potential stockholder value enhancing
opportunities, including potential financial and strategic partners for Cornerstone. The Board of Directors raised
questions around whether the public markets would appropriately value Cornerstone’s ongoing execution of its long-
term strategic plan. Following discussion, the Board of Directors determined to have further discussion on these
topics at its next regularly scheduled meeting following the announcement on February 16, 2021 of results for the
year and fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 and gauging associated investor and market reaction.
On March 15, 2021, in preparation for the next meeting of the Board of Directors and upon the recommendation of
certain members of the Board of Directors, representatives of Cornerstone management met with representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to obtain an additional viewpoint on Cornerstone’s financial and trading performance relative to
certain peer groups and the market generally, analyst perceptions of Cornerstone, the software market environment,
and potential financial and strategic partners for Cornerstone from a financial advisor considered by Cornerstone
management to have significant experience with, and deep knowledge of, the software industry and its participants.
On March 17, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of
Cooley and Centerview. Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of Directors general investor sentiment
following Cornerstone’s announcement of earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, Cornerstone’s
historical stock price performance relative to certain peer groups and the market more generally, and Cornerstone
management’s outlook (a) for the first quarter of 2021, which, based on current estimates, was expected to exceed
publicly disclosed guidance, and (b) for full-year 2021, which remained in-line with Cornerstone’s then current
internal forecasts. Representatives of Centerview reviewed reactions to Cornerstone’s results for the fourth quarter
ended December 31, 2020 and management reviewed opportunities and challenges associated with executing on
Cornerstone’s long-term standalone plan. Centerview noted that while software sector valuations remained at or near
all-time highs and that strategic and financial buyers were aggressively pursuing high-growth assets, since the time
of the last meeting of the Board of Directors on February 2, 2021 Nasdaq was down and it was possible that
valuations and multiples could start to contract, which could lead to a decline in Cornerstone’s trading multiple and
stock price. Centerview reviewed with the Board of Directors a framework for engagement with a select group of
strategic and financial partners to gauge potential interest in Cornerstone, with the goal of such process to
understand potential levels of interest with modest management time investment and using market feedback as the
basis for fact-based decision making regarding strategic planning. The proposed framework included abbreviated
management presentations to participants focusing on industry dynamics, the opportunities available to Cornerstone
and forward-looking financial information. The Board of Directors discussed the positive macro market environment,
including the historic multiples and premiums being paid in transactions in the software sector, the risk of a possible
market downturn and the resulting negative pressure that would put on valuations, and the positives and negatives
associated with undertaking a targeted outreach consistent with the framework previously discussed and determined
that, despite the risk of leaks and internal management distractions, the additional market intelligence that might be
obtained by such outreach would benefit the Board of Directors’ assessment of potential strategic alternatives,
including pursuing Cornerstone’s long-term standalone plan. The Board of Directors discussed with Cornerstone
management and representatives of Centerview the appropriate parties to contact in connection with such framework
based on an assessment of the parties most likely to be interested in a potential transaction and able to provide an
attractive valuation and determined to focus initially on a limited number of parties to limit the risk of leaks. It was
also determined that the timing of such outreach should begin on an appropriate date following the announcement of
Cornerstone’s first quarter earnings in May so that the contacted parties would have the benefit of the earnings
release information that the Board of Directors then expected to be viewed favorably. Following the determination by
the Board of Directors to proceed with the proposed framework, Cornerstone management recommended to the Board
of Directors that Qatalyst Partners be engaged, together with Centerview, to act on behalf of Cornerstone in
connection with such outreach based on Qatalyst Partners’
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
experience working with companies similarly situated to Cornerstone and the strength of its reputation and
experience, specifically in the software sector. Based on, among other things, the recommendation of certain directors
and the familiarity of other directors with Qatalyst Partners from prior professional interactions, the Board of
Directors agreed and instructed Cornerstone management to work with Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to
undertake such outreach following the announcement of earnings.
On May 6, 2021, Cornerstone announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021.
On May 20, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent Clearlake a proposed non-disclosure agreement. On June
2, 2021, after negotiations between the parties regarding the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, Clearlake and
Cornerstone executed a non-disclosure agreement.
During the period beginning on May 18, 2021 and continuing until June 7, 2021, consistent with the discussions with
the Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview contacted seven parties (including
Clearlake, Party A, Party B and one possible strategic buyer, Party C, a portfolio company of a financial sponsor)
regarding a potential strategic transaction. In addition, during that period, Cornerstone received unsolicited inbound
requests from three financial sponsors (including Vector and Party D), regarding a potential strategic transaction. Of
these parties (i) one party determined not to proceed in the process after initial contact and (ii) nine, including
Clearlake, Vector, Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D, executed non-disclosure agreements with Cornerstone that
included a “standstill” provision (but permitted parties to approach Cornerstone privately and confidentially during
the standstill period), a fall-away provision (upon the entry or public announcement of certain acquisition
transactions) and a restriction on engaging with any potential co-investor or financing source regarding a possible
transaction with Cornerstone without Cornerstone’s approval, and participated in initial meetings with Cornerstone
management. Of the nine parties that executed non-disclosure agreements, three parties determined not to proceed in
the process after the management presentations and six parties, including Clearlake, Vector, Party A, Party B, Party C
and Party D, were provided access following the management presentations to diligence information contained in a
virtual data room established by Cornerstone.
After close of trading on June 1, 2021 (the “Unaffected Date”), Clearlake filed a Schedule 13D in connection with
Cornerstone’s potential strategic review process, indicating beneficial ownership of approximately 8.3% of
Cornerstone’s common stock.
On June 8, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley,
Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed with the Board of
Directors the parties included in discussions to date and noted that a majority of prospective buyers contacted had
completed management presentations. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed with the Board
of Directors (i) historical stock price performance, (ii) Cornerstone’s stock price performance and trading volume
following Clearlake’s filing of a Schedule 13D on June 1, 2021, including that on June 2, 2021, the closing price of
Cornerstone common stock rose approximately 6.0% and daily trading volume was approximately 2.7x higher than the
three month daily average trading volume prior to the Unaffected Date, (iii) Cornerstone’s trading in the context of
selected peers, the broader software market and its Long Range Plan, (iv) potential next steps, including continued
engagement with existing parties, coupled with additional outbound calls to other potential financial and strategic
partners for Cornerstone, and request for parties to submit initial indications of interest (including with respect to
value) in late June, and (v) the benefits and risks of contacting additional parties. Taking these facts into account, the
Board of Directors discussed the advantages and disadvantages of engaging additional parties in discussions
regarding a possible strategic transaction, including the additional third party valuation information that could be
obtained and used to help guide strategic decision making and the incremental risk of leaks and management
distraction. Representatives of Cornerstone management then reviewed with the Board of Directors the preliminary
draft of the Long Range Plan including assumptions incorporated therein and, following discussion, the Board of
Directors directed Cornerstone management to revisit certain expense assumptions in fiscal year 2022 to ensure that
such assumptions were consistent with management’s current operational expectations for such fiscal year. Promptly
following the meeting, in response to the input provided by the Board of Directors, Cornerstone management revised
the Long Range Plan to reflect reduced operating expense assumptions for fiscal year 2022 for, among other things,
reduced travel and consulting expenses, and the Board of Directors adopted the Long Range Plan as so revised by
way of unanimous written consent on June 14, 2021. For a detailed discussion of the Long Range Plan, please see
below under the caption “-Financial Projections”). The Board of Directors meeting continued in
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
executive session, during which the Board of Directors continued to discuss the positives and negatives of
continuing, and potentially expanding, the strategic review process to include additional financial and strategic
partners for Cornerstone. The Board determined to proceed with additional outreach, and authorized Cornerstone
management to work with the financial advisors to target those parties believed most likely to be interested in and
able to acquire Cornerstone. The Board of Directors determined to formally engage Qatalyst Partners and Centerview
in connection with the ongoing strategic review process based on an assessment of such firms’ respective
knowledge and deal experience in the software industry and strategic review processes and directed Cornerstone
management to assist with the engagement process subject to Board of Directors’ approval of final engagement
terms. On July 1, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the terms of engagement with each of Qatalyst Partners and
Centerview, and Cornerstone executed an engagement letter with each of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview
formalizing the engagement of each of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to act as financial advisor to the Board of
Directors in connection with a potential strategic transaction.
During the period beginning on June 9, 2021 and continuing until June 22, 2021, consistent with the discussions with
the Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview discussed the potential transaction with
an additional nine parties, including four possible strategic buyers and five possible financial sponsors. In addition,
during that period, Cornerstone received unsolicited inbound requests from three financial sponsors, including Party
E and Party F, regarding a potential strategic transaction. Of these parties, (i) nine parties determined not to proceed
in the process after initial contact (which group included the four potential strategic buyers), (ii) three parties
(including Party E and Party F) executed non-disclosure agreements with Cornerstone that included a “standstill”
provision (but permitted parties to approach Cornerstone privately and confidentially during the standstill period), a
fall-away provision (upon the entry or public announcement of certain acquisition transactions) and a restriction on
engaging with any potential co-investor or financing source regarding a possible transaction with Cornerstone
without Cornerstone’s approval, and participated in initial meetings with Cornerstone management, and (iii) following
the initial management meetings, (x) one party determined not to proceed in the process and indicated to
representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview that it wanted to see future quarters of growth acceleration
before considering an investment in Cornerstone, and (y) two parties, Party E and Party F, determined to proceed in
the process and were provided access to diligence information contained in a virtual data room established by
Cornerstone.
On June 22, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview sent process letters to each of the parties that
remained active in the strategic process, including Clearlake, Vector, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party E, and
Party F, requesting that such parties submit initial indications of interest to acquire Cornerstone, including the price
per share proposed by such party, by June 28, 2021.
On June 23, 2021, Party C communicated to Philip S. Saunders, Cornerstone’s Chief Executive Officer, that it would
not be submitting an indication of interest, having previously cited concerns around the amount of additional work,
including with respect to integration, that Cornerstone still had to successfully complete before Party C would
consider an acquisition of Cornerstone. Party C noted that its affiliated financial sponsor that had also been actively
involved in Party C’s assessment of the opportunity may wish to separately continue in the process and that such
financial sponsor would make such determination in the coming days. Mr. Saunders then relayed this communication
to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview.
On June 24, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview received a proposal to acquire Cornerstone
from Party B for a range of $50.00 to $55.00 per share in cash.
On June 24 and June 25, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners communicated to each of the parties that had
received the July 22 process letter, other than Party B that had already submitted a proposal, that they were
participating in a highly competitive process and that the parties should be focused on providing a meaningful
premium to the current stock price of Cornerstone in any indications of interest.
On June 25, 2021, representatives of each of Party A and the financial sponsor affiliated with Party C contacted
representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform Qatalyst Partners that such party would not be submitting an initial
indication of interest. Party A noted that it was not going to participate in the process as it currently had other
priorities and it believed there was substantial execution risk and work required to achieve Cornerstone’s
transformation initiatives. The financial sponsor affiliated with Party C indicated that it was not going to proceed in
the process given concerns around execution risk with Cornerstone’s long-term initiatives and that it did not believe
its view of Cornerstone’s value would be competitive.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 28, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview received initial proposals to acquire
Cornerstone from (i) Clearlake for $56.00 per share in cash, (ii) Vector for a range of $56.00 to $58.00 per share in cash,
and (iii) Party E for $70.00 per share in cash. That same day, representatives of Party F informed representatives of
Qatalyst Partners that Party F would not be proceeding with the process as Party F did not believe its view of
Cornerstone’s value would be competitive.
On June 29, 2021, representatives of Party D contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and indicated that Party
D would not be proceeding in the process as Party D did not believe its view of Cornerstone’s value would be
competitive.
On June 30, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview called representatives of Party E to request
more information regarding Party E’s $70.00 per share proposal and to inquire about potential financing sources for
the transaction in light of the fact that publicly available historical transaction information indicated Party E had not
previously led transactions of the size implied by their proposal. Party E indicated they were continuing to evaluate
potential capital structure and sources.
On July 1, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners called representatives of Party B regarding Party B’s proposal of
$50.00 to $55.00 per share in cash and to inform Party B that such proposal was below other proposals provided and
to give Party B the opportunity to increase its proposal. Party B told representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it
would not be raising its proposal and that Party B would not be proceeding in the process.
On July 7, 2021, representatives of Party E called representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to discuss
Party E’s proposal. Party E indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview that due to resource and
capacity constraints Party E was not in a position to acquire Cornerstone and withdrew its offer. However, Party E
stated that it would be interested in participating as an equity partner for another potential acquiror should
Cornerstone proceed with a strategic transaction.
Later that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley,
Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of Directors management’s
preliminary estimates of certain performance metrics and trends through the end of the second quarter of 2021,
including with respect to customer renewal rates, expense management, sales pipeline and employee turnover, and
that, while successfully executing on the annual plan for fiscal year 2021 was still possible it remained subject to
challenges in and outside of Cornerstone’s control. Following discussion, Cooley reviewed with the Board of
Directors its fiduciary duties in connection with a strategic transaction process. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners
and Centerview then provided an update to the Board of Directors on the status of the strategic process, including
that Party A, Party B, Party C, as well as the financial sponsor of Party C, Party D, Party E and Party F had determined
not to proceed, the reasoning provided by such parties, and the collective view by the financial advisors that Vector
did not currently have sufficient funds under management to effectively lead an acquisition of Cornerstone, leaving
Clearlake as the only remaining credible potential buyer. The financial advisors noted that they had conveyed to
Vector their assessment regarding its ability to lead an acquisition, and in response Vector had requested the
opportunity to invest with a qualified buyer, should Cornerstone proceed with a strategic transaction. Following
discussion, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed certain financial aspects of the proposals
submitted by Clearlake, Vector, Party B and Party E and discussed the potential benefits of introducing Vector to
Clearlake, including as a way to potentially increase Clearlake’s view of Cornerstone’s value in light of the range
included in Vector's earlier proposal. The Board of Directors discussed, among other things, the current state of the
financial markets, valuations and multiples for software companies being at or near highs and the possibility of
market contraction given future macro uncertainties, including the possible disruptive impact of COVID-19 and
related variants (with regards to the return to work and day-to-day operations of Cornerstone and on the buying
decisions of its customers), a dynamic interest rate environment and/or possible tax reform. The Board of Directors
discussed the execution risk around the Long Range Plan and the fact that market perceptions of the degree of
difficulty attendant to successfully executing on that plan may have kept other participants from staying actively
involved in the strategic process and potentially has kept the price of Cornerstone’s common stock from improving
despite the recent announcements by Cornerstone of otherwise positive trends in its business. Following discussion,
the Board of Directors determined to (i) disclose to Vector Clearlake’s involvement in the process and permit Vector to
communicate with Clearlake and (ii) permit the parties to proceed in the process so that they could complete
confirmatory diligence and provide an increased and more definitive proposal for the Board of Directors to

consider, including with respect to legal and financial terms. Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed
with the Board of Directors the Internal Long Range Plan which supplemented the Long Range Plan to include non-
public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 in order to provide the Board of
Directors with a more detailed view of valuation and discussion ensued regarding certain of the assumptions
incorporated into such plan. The Board of Directors requested additional time to review the Internal Long Range Plan
and determined to continue discussion regarding the Internal Long Range Plan at the next meeting of the Board of
Directors.
Later that day and following the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners called
representatives of Clearlake to suggest that Clearlake consider allowing Vector to participate in the proposed
transaction. Clearlake represented that it would consider having Vector participate as a potential minority financing
source in connection with a potential transaction.
On July 14, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley.
Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of Directors the Internal Long Range Plan
previously provided at the end of the last meeting of the Board of Directors and certain of the key assumptions on
which the plan was prepared. For a detailed discussion of the Internal Long Range Plan, including such assumptions,
please see below under the caption “-Financial Projections”). Discussion ensued and the Board of Directors
adopted the Internal Long Range Plan and directed Cornerstone management to instruct each of Centerview and
Qatalyst Partners, respectively, to use the Internal Long Range Plan in connection with providing financial analyses
in connection with the Board of Directors’ evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, including the Merger.
Representatives of Cornerstone management then provided an update to the Board of Directors on the status of the
strategic process, including that Clearlake had confirmed that Clearlake had no objection to Vector participating in
some of the confirmatory diligence sessions.
In addition, on July 14, 2021, representatives of Cornerstone management gave a presentation to representatives of
Clearlake and Vector regarding Cornerstone’s business.
On July 15, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview, on behalf of Cornerstone, authorized Clearlake
to initiate contact with certain identified preferred equity and debt financing sources in order to secure the necessary
funding to finance the proposed transaction.
On July 19, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview sent a process letter to Clearlake requesting
Clearlake submit its final proposal, including comments to the draft Merger Agreement to be provided in the virtual
data room by no later than July 26, 2021.
Later that day, an auction draft of the Merger Agreement was provided to Clearlake via the virtual data room.
On July 23, 2021, a representative of a financial sponsor not involved in the process contacted Mr. Saunders, with
whom such representative had a personal and professional relationship for a number of years, to discuss
Cornerstone and inform Mr. Saunders that such representative had received inbound inquiries regarding
Cornerstone. The financial sponsor representative indicated a general interest in Cornerstone, but did not request
any information regarding, or express any interest in presently pursuing, a possible strategic transaction with
Cornerstone. Given the late date of the process, that the financial sponsor expressed no current intent to actively
engage Cornerstone regarding a possible strategic transaction and the belief of Cornerstone’s management and
financial advisors that the financial sponsor was undifferentiated relative to the other participants in the process, no
further action was taken.
On July 26, 2021, Clearlake submitted a revised proposal to acquire Cornerstone for $56.50 per share in cash,
representing a 29.0% premium to the closing price per share of Cornerstone common stock on the Unaffected Date,
the last full trading day prior to Clearlake filing a Schedule 13D, of $43.96 per share (the “Unaffected Cornerstone
Stock Price”). The Clearlake proposal included a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed, among
other things, a Company Termination Fee equal to 3.5% of the equity value of Cornerstone in certain limited
circumstances, including in the event Cornerstone were to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a
superior offer from another party, and a Parent Termination Fee equal to 5.0% of the equity value of Cornerstone in
certain limited circumstances, including if Clearlake failed to close the Merger when otherwise required by the Merger
Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 27, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners called representatives of Clearlake to convey that Clearlake’s
revised $56.50 per share offer was too low and that Clearlake would need to raise its offer price in order to be
successful in its bid to acquire Cornerstone.
On July 28, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of Cooley,
Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview reviewed the strategic
transaction process to date, including the fact that 24 parties (including five potential strategic buyers and 19
financial sponsors (including Clearlake)) had been contacted, and certain financial aspects of the revised $56.50 per
share proposal from Clearlake. The Board of Directors discussed the current state of the financial markets, including
the possibility of a market correction, and the substantial execution challenges facing Cornerstone previously
assessed in prior meetings. Additionally, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview discussed with the
Board of Directors the possibility that additional opportunities to initiate a strategic process in the short term would
be challenging given that Cornerstone would likely need to execute on its current strategic plan to garner renewed
attention from potential financial and strategic partners. The Board of Directors meeting continued in executive
session, during which the Board of Directors discussed certain key areas of the business, including that near term
catalysts for growth were limited given that Cornerstone’s current leverage ratio made it difficult for Cornerstone to
meaningfully participate as an active acquiror while competitors with more ready access to capital could seek to
capture consolidation opportunities that may make the competitive landscape more difficult for Cornerstone.
Following discussion, the Board of Directors determined that the valuation reflected in Clearlake’s current proposal
was low, but that there may be a path to completing a transaction if Clearlake were to increase its proposal and
increase the reverse termination fee payable by Clearlake, thereby increasing in the view of the Board of Directors the
level of closing certainty. Following the meeting, a representative of the Board of Directors contacted representatives
of Qatalyst Partners to relay the Board of Directors decision and to instruct Qatalyst Partners to convey the same to
Clearlake.
On July 30, 2021, Cooley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley”),
Clearlake’s outside legal counsel, which draft proposed, among other things, a 3.0% Company Termination Fee and
8.0% Parent Termination Fee, and an initial draft of the Miller Support Agreement, pursuant to which, among other
things, Mr. Miller and certain stockholders of Cornerstone affiliated with Mr. Miller would be required to vote their
shares of common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against any alternative acquisition proposals and any
action which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or
adversely affect the Merger. That same day, Sidley provided to Cooley initial drafts of the Equity Commitment Letter
and Limited Guarantee and initial drafts of the Silver Lake Support Agreements pursuant to which, among other
things, the Silver Lake Group would be required to support certain amendments to the Indenture governing the
Cornerstone Convertible Notes to facilitate the consummation of the proposed Merger and the financing relating
thereto.
Also on July 30, 2020, Qatalyst Partners informed Clearlake that the Board of Directors would not transact at
Clearlake’s current proposal.
On July 31, 2021, Sidley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Cooley, which draft proposed, among
other things, a 3.5% Company Termination Fee and 6.0% Parent Termination Fee. That same day, Sidley sent to
Cooley initial drafts of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter.
On August 2, 2021, Clearlake submitted a revised proposal to acquire Cornerstone for $57.00 per share in cash,
representing a 30.0% premium to the Unaffected Cornerstone Stock Price. Clearlake’s revised proposal included
executed debt financing commitments representing the proposed debt financing for the transaction as well as
executed equity financing commitments representing the proposed equity financing for the transaction.
Later that same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of
Cooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview provided an update
on the status of discussions with Clearlake, including the revised proposal of $57.00 per share, and reviewed with the
Board of Directors certain aspects of the proposed equity and debt financing package submitted by Clearlake,
including the sources and uses provided by Clearlake. The Board of Directors

TABLE OF CONTENTS
meeting continued in executive session, during which the Board of Directors further discussed Clearlake’s revised
proposal and possible responses. Following discussion, the Board of Directors determined to continue to negotiate
price and instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to seek a higher price from Clearlake.
Later that same day, Cooley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley, which draft proposed,
among other things, a 3.0% Company Termination Fee and 7.5% Parent Termination Fee.
On August 3, 2021, Qatalyst Partners called representatives of Clearlake to discuss the status of the proposed
transaction and conveyed that there was a path for Cornerstone to transact at $58.00 per share with a 3.25%
Company Termination Fee and a 7.0% Parent Termination Fee. Clearlake stated that it could not support a bid at
$58.00 per share and responded with a revised proposal to acquire Cornerstone for $57.50 per share in cash,
representing a 31.0% premium to the Unaffected Cornerstone Stock Price, indicating that it would not raise its price
any further.
Later that same day, Sidley provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Cooley, which draft proposed,
among other things, a 3.5% Company Termination Fee and 6.0% Parent Termination Fee, and an initial draft of the
Clearlake Support Agreement with the Clearlake Stockholder pursuant to which, among other things, the Clearlake
Stockholder would be required to vote its shares of common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against any
alternative acquisition proposals and any action which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger.
Later that same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of
Cooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Cornerstone management reviewed with the Board of
Directors certain adjustments proposed by Cornerstone management to fiscal year 2021 of the Internal Long Range
Plan, including to reflect actual results through the end of the second quarter and the estimated cost reductions for
2021. It was noted that because of the one-time nature of the cost reductions, they did not impact any fiscal year in
the Internal Long Range Plan other than 2021. Following discussion, the Board of Directors directed Cornerstone
management to revise the Internal Long Range Plan to reflect such adjustments and to provide such adjustments to
Clearlake. For a detailed discussion of the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan, including such adjustments, please
see below under the caption “-Financial Projections”. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Centerview
provided an update on the status of discussions with Clearlake including the revised proposal of $57.50 per share
provided by Clearlake and its statement that it would not increase price any further. Representatives of Cooley
described certain material terms and proposed changes to the draft Merger Agreement, including (a) the increase of
the Company Termination Fee from 3.0% to 3.5% of equity value and the decrease of the Parent Termination Fee from
7.5% to 6.0% of equity value, and (b) the requirement that the marketing period for Parent’s debt financing not begin
until US HSR Act and stockholder approval had been obtained. The Board of Directors meeting continued in
executive session, during which the Board of Directors further discussed Clearlake’s $57.50 per share proposal.
Representatives of Cooley then described the preliminary calculations that had been conducted in connection with
the excise tax potentially payable by certain members of Cornerstone management as a result of the anticipated
transaction under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 and the concept of gross-up payments for any related taxes
payable with respect to the payments of such excise taxes (such arrangements, “280G gross-up arrangements”). After
discussion and review of the preliminary excise tax and gross-up estimates, including that Clearlake would likely not
agree to any proposal that did not limit the potential liability associated with 280G gross-up arrangements, the Board
of Directors determined to provide 280G gross-up arrangements for affected members of Cornerstone management
subject to a $7,000,000 aggregate cap. After discussion, the Board of Directors concluded that, in light of all the
factors and risks associated with Cornerstone’s standalone plan, concerns regarding the risk of losing Clearlake’s
final offer of $57.50 per share if Cornerstone continued to pursue a higher price, the unlikeness of there being another
acquiror willing to pay a higher price to acquire Cornerstone given the broad nature of the strategic process
conducted and the fact the Clearlake’s proposal enabled Cornerstone stockholders to realize an immediate, certain
and significant premium for their stock without the execution and other risks associated with Cornerstone’s
standalone plan, it would agree to move forward on the basis of the $57.50 per share proposal provided that Clearlake
agree to (i) the marketing period beginning after Labor Day and (ii) a
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
3.25% Company Termination Fee and 7.0% Parent Termination Fee. In addition, the Board determined it would seek
from Clearlake the proposed 280G gross-up arrangements subject to a $7,000,000 aggregate cap. Following the
meeting, the Board of Directors directed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to relay the Board of Directors’ decision
to Clearlake.
Later that same day, at the direction of the Board of Directors, a representative of Qatalyst Partners called a
representative of Clearlake to express the Board of Directors’ willingness to proceed on the basis of the last offer
proposed by Clearlake of $57.50 per share in cash if Clearlake agreed to the terms outlined by the Board of Directors.
Shortly thereafter, Cooley sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley reflecting the terms outlined by the
Board of Directors.
On August 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and representatives of
Cooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. Representatives of Cornerstone management provided an update to the
Board of Directors regarding the current transaction status and noted that the terms of the Silver Lake Support
Agreements had not yet been finalized. Following the update from Cornerstone management, representatives of
Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board of Directors Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses of Clearlake’s $57.50 per
share proposal and then representatives of Centerview reviewed with the Board of Directors Centerview’s financial
analyses of Clearlake’s $57.50 per share proposal. Following the presentations by Qatalyst Partners and Centerview,
Cooley reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties applicable in connection with the strategic
transaction process and the proposed Merger, and reviewed certain material terms of the draft Merger Agreement and
related transactions, including (a) that the marketing period for Parent’s debt financing would begin on the earlier of
September 8, 2021 and the first date following the filing of the definitive proxy, which date was anticipated to roughly
coincide with September 8, 2021 absent SEC review of the preliminary proxy, (b) that Clearlake had agreed to the
3.25% Company Termination Fee and 7.0% Parent Termination Fee, (c) the conditions to the consummation of the
Merger, (d) that Mr. Miller (together with certain stockholders affiliated with Mr. Miller), the Clearlake Stockholder
and the Silver Lake Group would be entering into certain support agreements concurrently with the execution of the
Merger Agreement, and (e) that Clearlake had agreed to the proposed 280G gross-up arrangements subject to the
$7,000,000 aggregate cap proposed by Cornerstone. Cooley noted to the Board of Directors that Clearlake indicated it
had not included in a Support Agreement from Vector its latest proposal because it was unclear whether Vector would
ultimately be included as a minority investor in the proposed transaction. The Board of Directors then adjourned the
meeting and determined to reconvene the meeting after the terms and conditions to the Silver Lake Support
Agreements were finalized as among the parties.
Throughout the remainder of August 4 and 5, 2021, the parties worked to finalize the Merger Agreement and the
support agreements, including a support agreement from Vector (which would be entered into in connection with
Clearlake agreeing that Vector could make a minority investment in Parent at the closing of the Merger). The parties
also worked to finalize the Debt Commitment Letters, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Limited Guarantee.
On the afternoon of August 5, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Cornerstone management and
representatives of Cooley, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview to review the final Clearlake $57.50 per share proposal.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners confirmed to the Board of Directors that there were no material changes to the
financial analysis presented to the Board of Directors by Qatalyst Partners at the meeting of the Board of Directors
the day prior and delivered to the Board of Directors the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 5, 2021, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and
subject to various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the $57.50
per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate thereof)
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders,
as more fully described below in the section entitled “-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.” Representatives of
Centerview then confirmed to the Board of Directors that there were no material changes to the financial analysis
presented by Centerview to the Board of Directors at the meeting of the Board of Directors from the day prior and
delivered to the Board of Directors the oral opinion of Centerview, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of
a written opinion dated such date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the
$57.50 per share in cash to be paid to the holders of shares of common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant
to, and in accordance with, the Merger
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Centerview’s opinion,
please see below under the caption “-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC”). Following the presentations by
Qatalyst Partners and Centerview, Cooley reviewed with the Board of Directors the material terms of the draft Merger
Agreement and related transactions, including the related transaction documents. The Board of Directors then
discussed the potential transaction with Clearlake, and, after carefully considering the matters discussed during that
meeting and prior meetings of the Board of Directors (for more information, see the section titled “ -Reasons for the
Merger”), the Board of Directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support
Agreements and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (the
“Transactions”), are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Cornerstone and its stockholders; (ii) agreed
that the Merger shall be governed and effected in accordance with the DGCL; (iii) declared it advisable to enter into
the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreements and to consummate the Transactions, (iv) authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance by Cornerstone of the Merger Agreement, and the consummation
of the Transactions; and (v) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend
that the Cornerstone stockholders, on behalf of Cornerstone, to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the DGCL.
Later that day, the parties executed the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreements, the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter,
and Cornerstone and Clearlake issued a joint press release announcing the transaction, including that Vector had
agreed to make a minority investment in Parent at the Closing of the Merger (which was subsequently disclosed in an
amended Schedule 13D filed by Clearlake to consist of a contribution of shares of common stock of Cornerstone and
cash for an aggregate value of approximately $100 million).
On August 9, 2021, Party E contacted Cornerstone to request, and received, permission under the terms of Party E’s
non-disclosure agreement with Cornerstone to engage with Clearlake regarding a potential equity co-investment in
Parent.
On August 19, 2021, each of Cornerstone and Parent filed its Premerger Notification and Report Form with the FTC
and the Antitrust Division for review in connection with the Merger.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Cornerstone
and its stockholders; (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be governed and effected in accordance with the DGCL; (iii)
declared it advisable to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger; (iv) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by
Cornerstone of the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; and (v) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to
recommend that, on behalf of Cornerstone, the Cornerstone stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve
the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the DGCL.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of Cornerstone, that you vote: (i) “FOR” the adoption
the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal;
and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with Cornerstone
management, Cooley and its financial advisors, Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. The Board of Directors considered
the following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as generally
supporting its (i) determination that the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreements and the Transactions, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interest of, Cornerstone and its stockholders, (ii) authorization and approval of the execution, delivery and
performance by Cornerstone of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
35TABLE OF CONTENTS
Transactions, including the Merger and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
recommendation that Cornerstone stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the
Transactions.
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share represented a compelling premium to historical
market prices for the shares of Cornerstone common stock, including that the Merger Consideration
constituted a premium of:
•
approximately 31% to the closing price of Cornerstone’s common stock of $43.96 on June 1, 2021, the
last full trading day prior to Clearlake filing a Schedule 13D in connection with Cornerstone’s potential
strategic review process; and
•
approximately 40% to Cornerstone’s last twelve months volume weighted average price for the period
ending on June 1, 2021, the last full trading day prior to Clearlake filing a Schedule 13D in connection
with Cornerstone’s potential strategic review process;
•
the fact that, during the course of negotiations with Clearlake (as more fully described below under the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Background of the Merger”), Clearlake increased its
initial offer from $56.00 per share on June 30, 2021, to $56.50 per share on July 26, 2021, to $57.00 per share
on August 2, 2021, and then, ultimately, to $57.50 per share on August 3, 2021;
•
the belief that, (i) as a result of an active negotiating process, including specific instruction from Clearlake,
Cornerstone had obtained Clearlake’s best and final offer, and (ii) there was substantial risk of losing
Clearlake’s final offer of $57.50 per share if Cornerstone continued to pursue a higher price, the Merger
Consideration represented the highest price that Clearlake was willing to pay and the highest price per
share value reasonably obtainable under the circumstances as of the date of the Merger Agreement;
•
the strategic transaction process conducted by Cornerstone, including the fact that 24 different parties,
including potential strategic and financial partners (including Clearlake), were contacted or solicited during
the process in an effort to obtain the best value reasonably available to Cornerstone stockholders, and that
no such party was willing to move forward with Cornerstone regarding a potential transaction on terms that
were better than the Clearlake proposal;
•
the fact that the consideration to be paid in the Merger is payable solely in cash, which allows Cornerstone
stockholders to realize immediate liquidity and certainty of value in respect of their shares of Cornerstone
common stock, while eliminating the effect on stockholders of long-term business and execution risk, as
well as risks related to the financial markets generally (including the ongoing risks and uncertainties around
COVID-19 and related variants on return to work and day-to-day operations of Cornerstone, on
Cornerstone’s customers (including with respect to buying decisions and potentially extended sales
cycles) and on the broader financial markets);
•
the belief that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to Cornerstone stockholders than the potential
value that would reasonably be expected to result from other strategic and financial alternatives reasonably
available, which could include: (i) the continuation of Cornerstone’s business plan as an independent
enterprise, as assessed based on its historical results of operations, financial prospects and condition; (ii)
modifications to Cornerstone’s business and operations strategy; and (iii) potential expansion
opportunities, including into new business lines, through acquisitions and combinations of Cornerstone
with other businesses;
•
the belief that the aforementioned other strategic and financial alternatives were not reasonably likely to
create greater value for Cornerstone’s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account, among other
variables, (i) execution risks as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks, particularly those
in the subscription software and talent management industries more generally, (ii) risks resulting from
Cornerstone’s inability at present to meaningfully participate as an active acquirer as a result of its current
leverage ratio while competitors with more available access to capital may foreclose future opportunities for
growth by acquisition, (iii) risks associated with completing the successful integration of Saba Software,
Inc. and the other related acquired entities (“Saba”), (iv) risks that Cornerstone may not be able to increase
revenues in line with market expectations and/or internal projections, (v) risks involved with future
employee retention, (vi) risks around whether the public market will appropriately
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
value Cornerstone’s ongoing execution progress of its business plan,(vii) risks associated with
Cornerstone achieving internal revenue projections, which are highly dependent on the launch of new
products, (including risks and uncertainties regarding efforts to drive customer adoption of Cornerstone’s
new platform and content offerings), (viii) the fact that Cornerstone’s research analyst coverage and
trading volumes had diminished over time and the risk that these factors could adversely impact future
stock performance, and (ix) risks associated with a decline in market trading multiples over time, which
could lead to a decline in Cornerstone’s trading multiple and stock price;
•
the high degree of certainty that the closing would be achieved in a timely manner, under the terms of the
Merger Agreement;
•
that (i) the Signing Stockholders that held, in the aggregate, approximately 15.65% of the voting power of
the outstanding shares of Cornerstone common stock as of July 30, 2021, entered into the Voting and
Support Agreements obligating each of them during the term of such agreement (A) subject to certain
limited exceptions, not to transfer any shares of Cornerstone common stock owned by them and (B) to vote
all their shares of Cornerstone common stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
approval of the Merger and the other Transactions and/or (2) against any acquisition proposal or any
action or agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to
Cornerstone’s obligations to consummate the Merger as specified in the Merger Agreement not being
fulfilled or any alternative acquisition proposals, and (ii) the Silver Lake Group entered into the Silver Lake
Support Agreements, which requires the Silver Lake Group (A) subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer
or convert into common stock their Cornerstone Convertible Notes and (B) to support certain amendments
to the Indenture to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the financing relating thereto;
•
the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 5,
2021, and subject to the various limitations, qualifications, assumptions and other conditions set forth in
such written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cornerstone
common stock (other than Parent or an affiliate of Parent), pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,” which full text of
the written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement in its entirety;
•
the oral opinion of Centerview, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 5, 2021,
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations set forth in such written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in its opinion,
which include, for example, shares of common stock owned by stockholders who have properly and validly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL), pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described
below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Opinion of Centerview Partners
LLC,” which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
•
the terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including:
•
the conditions to the consummation of the Merger being specific and limited, including the
requirement that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Cornerstone common stock;
•
Cornerstone’s right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate unsolicited acquisition
proposals that are made on or after August 5, 2021 and prior to the time that the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the Transactions are approved by Cornerstone’s stockholders, as more fully described
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The
Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Change Recommendation”;

•
the fact that Parent and Merger Sub have obtained committed debt and preferred equity financing for
the transaction from reputable financial institutions and from certain affiliated funds of Parent and
committed equity financing from certain affiliated funds of Parent that together provide funding of an
amount sufficient to cover the aggregate Merger Consideration, all fees and expenses payable by
Parent, Merger Sub or Cornerstone on the date on which the Closing occurs (the “Closing Date”) and
the repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness required to be repaid or refinanced on the Closing
Date;
•
the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Financing
and the limited number and nature of the conditions to the Financing;
•
the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger, including the absence of any financing condition
in the Merger Agreement;
•
Cornerstone’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Equity
Commitment Letter, to seek specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the equity
commitment to be funded;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement provides that Parent will pay Cornerstone a termination fee in the
amount of $320,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Cornerstone due to any breach of
representations or covenants made by Parent or Merger Sub that causes a closing condition not to be
satisfied (following notice and an opportunity to cure) or in certain circumstances in which all other
closing conditions have been satisfied, but Parent or Merger Sub fails to close when required to do so
under the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that the Guarantors provided a limited guaranty in favor of Cornerstone, which, taken
together, guarantee the obligation of Parent to pay any termination fee, reimburse and indemnify
Cornerstone with respect to certain expenses in connection with its cooperation with obtaining
Parent’s debt financing and pay certain other amounts required under the Merger Agreement, subject
to an aggregate cap equal to $322,000,000 (as more fully described below under the section of this
proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Financing of the
Merger”);
•
Cornerstone’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Offer, subject to
certain conditions of the Merger Agreement and paying Parent a termination fee of $150,000,000;
•
the fact that the Board of Directors believed that the Cornerstone termination fee of $150,000,000 is
reasonable, is consistent with market averages for such fees payable in comparable transactions, and
is not preclusive of, or a substantial impediment to, a third party making an Acquisition Proposal (as
more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement-The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Change
Recommendation”);
•
Cornerstone’s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement;
•
the end date of February 5, 2022, allowing for time that the Board of Directors believes to be sufficient
to complete the Merger;
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Cornerstone’s stockholders who
do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required
procedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to
have a Delaware court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or
the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement; and
•
the likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger
will be completed.
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the
following (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
•
the fact that Cornerstone would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and
stockholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any
potential future appreciation in value of Cornerstone;
•
the risks and costs to Cornerstone if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner,
including the diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on Cornerstone’s
business and relationships with customers, partners and employees, any or all of which risks and costs,
among other things, could adversely affect Cornerstone’s overall competitive position and the trading price
of Cornerstone’s common stock;
•
the requirement that Cornerstone pay Parent a termination fee of $150,000,000 under certain circumstances
following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Board of Directors terminates the Merger
Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Offer (as more fully described
under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The
Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Adverse Change Recommendation”);
•
if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of failure to obtain the Debt Financing or as a breach of the
Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, remedies may be limited to the termination fee payable by
Parent described above, which may be inadequate to compensate Cornerstone for the damage caused, and
if available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any
such action may be uncertain;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Cornerstone’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger,
including the requirement that Cornerstone conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific
limitations, which may delay or prevent Cornerstone from undertaking business opportunities that may
arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Cornerstone might have
pursued;
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would generally be taxable to Cornerstone’s stockholders that are U.S.
persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement prohibits Cornerstone and its representatives from
soliciting third party acquisition proposals until the earlier of the filing of the certificate of merger and the
termination of the Merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time
and effort of Cornerstone management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business
operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of
termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of Cornerstone’s common stock;
•
the fact that the completion of the Merger will require certain antitrust clearance and consents, which
clearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risks;
•
the fact that Cornerstone’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, those of Cornerstone’s stockholders (see below under the caption “-Interests of
Cornerstone’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”); and
•
the possible loss of key management or other personnel of Cornerstone during the pendency of the
Merger.
The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby addresses the reasons considered by Cornerstone’s Board of
Directors in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of reasons considered by the Board of
Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors
did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
specific reasons considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information
and reasons described above, individual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal
business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors
based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the reasons
and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Financial Projections
While Cornerstone has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning aspects of its expected financial
performance from time to time, Cornerstone does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal
projections as to future performance or results of operations due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying
assumptions and projections. However, in connection with the review of potential strategic alternatives, including
Cornerstone’s evaluation of the Merger, Cornerstone’s management, at the direction of the Board of Directors,
prepared certain unaudited, long-range financial projections (collectively, as described and defined in more detail
below, the “Projections”). Cornerstone management provided the Projections to the Board of Directors, and at the
direction of the Board of Directors, to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. The Board of Directors directed each of
Qatalyst Partners and Centerview, respectively, to use the Projections as they existed at the applicable time in
connection with providing financial analyses in connection with the evaluation by the Board of Directors of potential
strategic alternatives, including the Merger.
In June 2021, management prepared non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2021
through 2024 (the “Long Range Plan”), and the Long Range Plan was discussed with, and approved for use by, the
Board of Directors in connection with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, including the Merger. The
Long Range Plan was provided to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview as well as Clearlake and other potential acquirers
in late-June 2021. In July 2021, management supplemented the Long Range Plan to include non-public, unaudited
prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 (the “Internal Long Range Plan”), and provided the
Internal Long Range Plan to the Board of Directors and to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. The Internal Long
Range Plan was not provided to any potential acquirers.
Later in July 2021, management made adjustments to the unaudited forecasts for fiscal year 2021 (such revisions, the
“Long Range Plan Adjustments”) to, among other things, reflect actual results through the second quarter of 2021
and reduced cost estimates for the second half of fiscal year 2021 due, in part, to lighter than expected travel and
entertainment expenses, delays in relation to certain hiring objectives and reductions to discretionary expense
reserves in the annual budget, and at the direction of the Board of Directors, provided the Long Range Plan
Adjustments to Qatalyst Partners and Centerview. As compared to the Long Range Plan, the Long Range Plan
Adjustments reflected an increase in total revenue for fiscal year 2021 from to $855 million to $859 million, an increase
in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) from $276 million to $304
million, an increase in non-GAAP operating income from $226 million to $255 million, an increase in levered free cash
flow from $173 million to $185 million and an increase in unlevered free cash flow from $221 million to $235 million.
Because of the one-time nature of the cost reductions included in the Long Range Plan Adjustments, and such
reductions did not impact any fiscal year other than 2021. The Long Range Plan Adjustments (except for adjusted
EBITDA and levered free cash flow, separate line items for which were not included in the Long Range Plan
previously shared with Clearlake) were shared with Clearlake on August 3, 2021 in connection with Clearlake’s due
diligence review. The Internal Long Range Plan was revised to reflect the Long Range Plan Adjustments (as so
revised, the “Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan”), and at the direction of the Board of Directors, provided to
Qatalyst Partners and Centerview for purposes of rendering their respective fairness opinions to the Board of
Directors and related financial analyses.
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, nor were
they prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections of
prospective financial information. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the Projections were relied upon by the
Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Merger and the Merger Consideration. While
Cornerstone believes that such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information in analyzing
Cornerstone’s financial results, there are limitations associated with the use of such financial measures. Such non-
GAAP measures as used by Cornerstone may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The SEC rules, which otherwise would
require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure, do not apply to non-GAAP
financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in connection with a proposed business
combination transaction such as the proposed Transactions if the disclosure is included in a document such as this
proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to a GAAP financial measure were not
provided to or relied upon by the Board of Directors or Cornerstone’s financial advisors in connection with the
Merger. Accordingly, Cornerstone has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the
Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. The Projections may differ from published analyst estimates
and forecasts, and do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including
the announcement of the Transactions.
The Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by Cornerstone management with respect to general
business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of
which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Cornerstone’s control. In particular, the Projections, while
presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions (as described
below) that are inherently uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become
subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that will
have an effect on Cornerstone’s business and its results of operations. None of Cornerstone, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the
validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the ultimate performance of Cornerstone
relative to the financial projections. The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation of Cornerstone that the Projections or the information contained therein is material.
Except as required by applicable law, neither Cornerstone nor any of its affiliates intends to, and each of them
disclaims any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the Projections if any or all of them have changed or
change or otherwise have become, are or become inappropriate (even in the short term). These considerations should
be taken into account if evaluating the Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding Cornerstone in its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by Cornerstone
management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, and therefore the Projections do not give effect to the proposed Transactions or any changes
to Cornerstone’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including
any costs incurred in connection with the proposed Transactions. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into
account the effect of any failure of the proposed Transactions to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate
or continuing in that context.
The Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the
Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Cornerstone or anyone who received the Projections then
considered, or now considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this
information should not be relied upon as such. Cornerstone management views the Projections as being subject to
inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such long-range projections.
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, levered free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow contained in
the Projections set forth below are each “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance measures
that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a
substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges
and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance
with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is calculated to exclude stock-based
compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, one-time restructuring, acquisition related and integration expenses and other
non-recurring charges, and is adjusted for the impact of the fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired deferred
revenue.
Non-GAAP Operating Income is calculated to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, one-time
restructuring, acquisition related and integration expenses and other non-recurring charges.
Levered free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and capitalized software
development costs.
Reflects a long-term cash rate of 20% as Cornerstone transitions to a partial tax-payer in 2025 and a full tax-payer in 2026 after
the full utilization of Cornerstone’s existing net operating losses.
Unlevered free cash flow is defined as Non-GAAP Operating Income less (i) cash taxes, less (ii) capital expenditures, less (iii)
capitalized software development costs, plus (iv) depreciation expense, less (v) investment in working capital, less (vi) one-time
restructuring, acquisition related and integration expenses.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to our Board of Directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion,
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other

does not constitute a recommendation to any Cornerstone stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the Merger
or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of Cornerstone common
stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
For purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and certain
publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Cornerstone.
42TABLE OF CONTENTS
Qatalyst Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to Cornerstone prepared by management
of Cornerstone, including the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan. Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past
and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Cornerstone with senior management of
Cornerstone. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Cornerstone
common stock and compared the financial performance of Cornerstone and the prices and trading activity of
Cornerstone common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In
addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition
transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as it deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or
discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Cornerstone. With respect to the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan, Qatalyst
Partners was advised by Cornerstone’s management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Adjusted Internal Long
Range Plan had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
of the management of Cornerstone of the future financial performance of Cornerstone and other matters covered
thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in
connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions
or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on Cornerstone or the contemplated benefits
expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Cornerstone or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst
Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent
verification, upon the assessment of the management of Cornerstone as to the existing and future technology and
products of Cornerstone and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has
been approved by Qatalyst Partners’ opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice. Qatalyst Partners’
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and
does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of Cornerstone common stock will trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion
may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion did not address the underlying
business decision of Cornerstone to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to Cornerstone. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of
Parent), and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of Cornerstone or any of its affiliates, or any class of
such persons, relative to such consideration.
The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion
dated August 5, 2021. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any
portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of
potential per-share present values for Cornerstone common stock as of June 30, 2021 (which is the end of
Cornerstone’s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet date) by:
•
adding:
(i)
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Cornerstone, based
on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan, for the third quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar
year 2025 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 8.0% to
12.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Cornerstone); and
(ii)
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Cornerstone, calculated by
multiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow in calendar year 2026 of approximately $381 million
based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan (noting that such number was based on a long-term
cash tax rate of 20.0%, as provided by Cornerstone management), by a range of multiples of fully
diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 14.0x to 23.0x
(which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and discounted to present
value using the same range of discount rates used in item (i) above; and
(iii) Cornerstone’s cash and cash equivalents of $149 million as of June 30, 2021, as provided by
Cornerstone management;
•
subtracting the $300 million face value of Cornerstone’s outstanding convertible debt and the $828 million
principal amount of Cornerstone’s outstanding term loan, each as of June 30, 2021, as provided by
Cornerstone management; and
•
dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock
(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account restricted stock units,
performance-based restricted stock units and in-the-money stock options as of July 30, 2021 and inclusive
of a subsequent August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which amounts were provided by Cornerstone’s
management, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt, with each of the above-
referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the
degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period (0.25%
combined in the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2021 and approximately 3% annually through
calendar year 2025) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future
equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Cornerstone management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone common
stock of approximately $41.63 to $76.14.

Based upon the Analyst Projections for calendar year 2022, and using the closing trading prices as of August 4, 2021,
for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied fully diluted
enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2022 (the “CY2022E Revenue
Multiples”) for each of the selected companies.
The CY2022E Revenue Multiple for Cornerstone was 4.5x based on the Analyst Projections, and the fully diluted
enterprise value of Cornerstone was calculated using the closing price of Cornerstone common stock as of the
Unaffected Date.
Based on the analysis of the CY2022E Revenue Multiples for the selected companies and the application of its
professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 4.0x to 6.0x and applied this range to
Cornerstone’s estimated calendar year 2022 revenue based on each of the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and the
Analyst Projections. Based on the fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury
stock method), which takes into account restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and in-the-
money stock options as of July 30, 2021 and inclusive of a subsequent August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which
amounts were provided by Cornerstone’s management, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money
convertible debt, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone common stock of approximately
$37.13 to $60.41 based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and approximately $37.87 to $61.40 based on the
Analyst Projections.
Based upon the Analyst Projections as of August 4, 2021, for calendar year 2022, and using the closing prices as of
August 4, 2021, for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied
fully diluted equity value divided by the estimated consensus levered free cash flow for calendar year 2022 (the
“CY2022E LFCF Multiples”) for each of the selected companies.
The CY2022E LFCF Multiple for Cornerstone was 13.2x based on the Analyst Projections, and the fully diluted equity
value of Cornerstone was calculated using the closing price of Cornerstone common stock as of the Unaffected Date.
Based on the analysis of the CY2022E LFCF Multiples for each of the selected companies and the application of its
professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 12.0x to 20.0x and applied this range to
Cornerstone’s estimated calendar year 2022 levered free cash flow based on each of the Adjusted Internal Long
Range Plan and the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for the
analysis utilizing CY2022E Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for
Cornerstone common stock of approximately $45.16 to $72.32 based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and
approximately $40.15 to $64.33 based on the Analyst Projections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Cornerstone. In evaluating the selected
companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control
of Cornerstone, such as the impact of competition on Cornerstone’s business and the industry in general, industry
growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Cornerstone’s financial condition and prospects or the
industry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the
arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners compared 19 selected public software transactions announced since 2010 that had a deal value of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the analysis of the NTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners selected
a representative multiple range of 3.0x to 5.5x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment)
and applied this range to Cornerstone’s estimated revenue for the twelve-month period ending on June 30, 2022, of
$891 million based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the number of fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common
stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account restricted stock units, performance-
based restricted stock units and in-the-money stock options as of July 30, 2021, and inclusive of a subsequent
August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which amounts were provided by Cornerstone’s management, and excluding shares
underlying in-the-money convertible debt due to assuming cash settlement, including (if applicable) the value of any
additional make-whole shares based on an assumed transaction close date of December 31, 2021, this analysis implied
a range of per share values for Cornerstone common stock of approximately $23.77 to $53.27.
Based on the analysis of the NTM EBITDA Multiple for each of the selected transactions Qatalyst Partners selected
a representative range of 10.5x to 20.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and
applied that range to Cornerstone’s adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ending on June 30, 2022 of $278
million, based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for the
analysis utilizing NTM Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone
common stock of approximately $27.21 to $61.60.
Based on the analysis of the NTM LFCF Multiple for each of the selected transactions Qatalyst Partners selected a
representative range of 13.0x to 22.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and
applied that range to Cornerstone’s estimated levered free cash flow for the twelve-month period ending on June 30,
2022 of $224 million based on the Analyst Projections (and increased to normalize for one-time Saba-related
integration cash expenses over the same period). Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for
the analysis utilizing NTM Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for
Cornerstone common stock of approximately $40.73 to $68.51.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Cornerstone or the Merger. In
evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general
business, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cornerstone’s control, such
as the impact of competition on Cornerstone’s business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence
of any material adverse change in Cornerstone’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial
markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the
transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining
the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned
against placing undue reliance on this information.
Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the Merger by our Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses,
without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying
its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less
weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not
be taken to be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of Cornerstone. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst
Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cornerstone’s control. Any estimates contained in
Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Parent or any
affiliate of Parent), to such holders. This analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which
Cornerstone common stock might actually trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to our Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by our
Board of Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of our Board of Directors with respect to the Merger
Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders
of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), or of whether our Board of
Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The Merger Consideration payable in the
Merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Cornerstone and Parent and was unanimously
approved by our Board of Directors. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Cornerstone during these negotiations.
Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Cornerstone or that any specific
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Cornerstone, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between
Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Cornerstone or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by
Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking
and other financial services to Cornerstone, Parent, or Clearlake and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst
Partners would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provided Cornerstone with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed Merger
for which it will be paid approximately $45,000,000, $4,000,000 of which was payable upon the delivery of its
opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon,
and subject to, the consummation of the Merger. Cornerstone has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for
its expenses incurred in performing its services. Cornerstone has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and
its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person
controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal
securities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

48TABLE OF CONTENTS
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review
undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Centerview
reviewed, among other things:
•
a draft of the Merger Agreement dated August 5, 2021 (the “Draft Merger Agreement”);
•
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Cornerstone for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019
and December 31, 2018;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Cornerstone;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Cornerstone;
•
certain other communications from Cornerstone to its stockholders; and
•
certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and
prospects of Cornerstone, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to
Cornerstone prepared by management of Cornerstone and furnished to Centerview by Cornerstone for
purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which constitute the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan referred to
elsewhere in this proxy statement under “The Merger-Financial Projections” (collectively referred to in this
summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “Internal Data”).
Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of
Cornerstone regarding their assessment of the Internal Data. In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available
financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for Cornerstone and compared that data with similar
data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview
deemed relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and
conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Centerview
deemed appropriate.
Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness
of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by
Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with Cornerstone’s consent, Centerview relied upon such information as
being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at Cornerstone’s direction, that the Internal Data
(including, without limitation, the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Cornerstone as to the matters covered
thereby and Centerview relied, at Cornerstone’s direction, on the Internal Data for purposes of Centerview’s analysis
and opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or the assumptions on which it was
based. In addition, at Cornerstone’s direction, Centerview did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of
any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of Cornerstone, nor was
Centerview furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and was not asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a
physical inspection of the properties or assets of Cornerstone. Centerview assumed, at Cornerstone’s direction, that
the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion
from the Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also assumed, at Cornerstone’s direction, that
the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with all
applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or
amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or
Centerview’s opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other
approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other
change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion.
Centerview did not evaluate and did not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of Cornerstone, or the
ability of Cornerstone to pay its obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the Transaction on such
matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Centerview is not
a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisor, and Centerview expressed no opinion as to any legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting matters.

proceed with or effect the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative
business strategies or transactions that might be available to Cornerstone or in which Cornerstone might engage.
Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of
Centerview’s written opinion, to the holders of shares of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) of
the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For purposes of its opinion,
Centerview was not asked to, and Centerview did not, express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any
other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the structure or form
of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into
in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the
Transaction or any other term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection
therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Cornerstone or any other party. In addition, Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the
fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable
to any of the officers, directors or employees of Cornerstone or any party, or class of such persons in connection
with the Transaction, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Cornerstone
common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Centerview’s opinion
was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and other conditions and circumstances as
in effect on, and the information made available to Centerview as of, the date of Centerview’s written opinion, and
Centerview does not have any obligation or responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion based on
circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of Centerview’ written opinion. Centerview’s opinion
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Cornerstone or any other person as to how such
stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction
or any other matter. Centerview’s financial advisory services and its written opinion were provided for the information
and assistance of the Board of Directors (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection
with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The issuance of Centerview’s opinion was approved
by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.
Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board of Directors in
connection with Centerview’s opinion, dated August 5, 2021. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a
complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of,
Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given
to those financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable
than other assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized
below should not be taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual value of Cornerstone. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the
tables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses
or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In
performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Cornerstone or any
other parties to the Transaction. None of Cornerstone, Parent, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in
these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of Cornerstone
do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Cornerstone may actually be sold. Accordingly, the
assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is
based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 5, 2021, the last trading day before
the public announcement of the Transaction, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Trading Multiples of Selected Public Companies Analysis
Centerview reviewed certain financial information of Cornerstone and compared it to corresponding financial
information of certain publicly traded companies that Centerview selected, based on its experience and professional
judgment (which are referred to as the “selected companies” in this summary of Centerview’s opinion). Although
none of the selected companies is directly comparable to Cornerstone, the companies listed below were chosen by
Centerview because, among other reasons, they are publicly traded companies with certain operational, business
and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of
Cornerstone.
However, because none of the selected companies is exactly the same as Cornerstone, Centerview believed that it
was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company
analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional
judgment, concerning differences between the operational, business and/or financial characteristics of Cornerstone
and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which
to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of August 4, 2021,
Centerview calculated, for each selected company, among other things, (i) such company’s implied fully-diluted
enterprise value divided by the CY2022E Revenue Multiples and (ii) such company’s CY2022E LFCF Multiples.
The selected companies are summarized below:

“N/A” means not publicly available.
Based on its analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and
experience, Centerview selected a reference range of CY2022E Revenue Multiples of 4.5x to 6.0x and a reference range
of CY2022E LFCF Multiples of 12.0x to 20.0x. In selecting these ranges of CY2022E Revenue Multiples and CY2022E
LFCF Multiples, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment
concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics of Cornerstone and the selected
companies that could affect their public trading values in order to provide a context in which to consider the results
of the quantitative analysis.
Centerview applied the reference range of CY2022E Revenue Multiples to Cornerstone’s 2022E Revenue of $908
million, as provided by management of Cornerstone. Centerview then divided the result of the foregoing calculations
by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock outstanding (determined using the treasury
stock method and taking into account outstanding restricted stock units, performance stock units and deferred stock
units and assuming net-share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt) as of August 2, 2021, as set forth in the
Internal Data, to derive a range of implied values per share of Cornerstone common stock of $43.25 to $60.50, rounded
to the nearest $0.25.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Centerview applied the reference range of CY2022E LFCF Multiples to Cornerstone’s 2022E levered free cash flow of
$271 million, as provided by management of Cornerstone. Centerview then divided the result of the foregoing
calculations by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock outstanding (determined using the
treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding restricted stock units, performance stock units and
deferred stock units and assuming net-share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt) as of August 2, 2021, as
set forth in the Internal Data, to derive a range of implied values per share of Cornerstone common stock of $45.00 to
$72.25, rounded to the nearest $0.25.
Centerview compared both of these ranges to the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share in cash, without interest,
to be paid to the holders of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Centerview reviewed and compared certain information relating to the following selected transactions that
Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment (which are referred to as the “selected transactions”
in this summary of Centerview’s opinion), deemed relevant to consider in relation to Cornerstone and the Merger.
However, because none of the selected transactions used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the
Merger, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results
of the selected transaction analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its
experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the operational, business or financial
characteristics of Cornerstone and each target company as well as the Merger and the selected transactions that
could affect the transaction values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the
quantitative analysis. Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, the selected
transactions listed below were selected, among other reasons, based on Centerview’s experience and professional
judgment, because the selected transactions have certain characteristics that, for the purposes of this analysis, may
be considered similar to certain characteristics of the Merger. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding
each of the selected transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business,
operations, financial conditions and prospects of Cornerstone and the target companies included in the selected
transactions analysis.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, Wall Street research, Capital IQ and other data
sources, Centerview calculated, for each selected transaction, among other things, (i) the NTM Revenue Multiple and
(ii) the NTM EBITDA Multiple for each selected transaction.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the target companies in the selected transactions and other
considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, Centerview selected a
reference range of NTM Revenue Multiples of 3.5x to 5.0x and NTM EBITDA Multiples of 14.0x to 20.0x. In selecting
these reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating
characteristics and prospects of Cornerstone and the target companies included in the selected transactions and
other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of such companies or Cornerstone.
Centerview applied these reference ranges to Cornerstone’s projected NTM Revenue of $883 million and NTM
EBITDA of $312 million as of June 30, 2021, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Cornerstone. Centerview
subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values Cornerstone’s net debt of approximately $979 million as of
June 30, 2021, as provided by management of Cornerstone, to derive a range of implied equity values for Cornerstone.
Centerview then divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone
common stock outstanding (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding
restricted stock units, performance stock units and deferred stock units and assuming cash settlement of in-the-
money convertible notes, including (if applicable) the value of any additional make-whole shares based on an
assumed transaction close date of December 31, 2021) as of August 2, 2021, as set forth in the Internal Data, to derive
a range of implied values per share of Cornerstone common stock of $29.50 to $47.00 for Cornerstone’s NTM
Revenue and $46.50 to $70.25 for Cornerstone’s NTM EBITDA, each rounded to the nearest $0.25.
Centerview compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share in cash, without interest, to be paid
to the holders of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Cornerstone based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range
Plan. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or
set of assets by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. “Present
value” refers to the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows by a
discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of
capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated an implied per share equity range for the shares of Cornerstone
common stock by discounting to present value as of June 30, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 8.25% to
10.00% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of Cornerstone’s weighted average cost of capital) and the mid-year
convention, the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of Cornerstone (burdened for stock-based compensation
expense based on discussions with Cornerstone management) based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan for
calendar year 2021 through calendar year 2025. The implied terminal value of Cornerstone at the end of the forecast
period was estimated by using terminal unlevered free cash flow multiples ranging from 15.0x to 20.0x (which were
chosen based on Centerview’s professional judgment).
Based on its analysis, Centerview calculated a range of implied enterprise values of Cornerstone. Centerview
subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values Cornerstone’s net debt of approximately $979 million as of
June 30, 2021, as provided by management of Cornerstone, to derive a range of implied equity values for Cornerstone.
Centerview then divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully-diluted shares of Cornerstone
common stock outstanding (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding
restricted stock units, performance stock units and deferred stock units outstanding and assuming net-share
settlement of in-the-money convertible debt) as of August 2, 2021, as set forth in the Internal Data, to derive a range
of implied values of Cornerstone common stock of $50.75 to $71.25 per share, rounded to the nearest $0.25.
Centerview compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $57.50 per share in cash, without interest, to be paid
to the holders of Cornerstone common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Board of Directors certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including,
among other things, the following:
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis: Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of the
shares of Cornerstone common stock during the 52-week period ending on August 4, 2021, which reflected
low and high stock intraday prices for Cornerstone common stock during such period of $33.75 to $55.25
per share, rounded to the nearest $0.25;
•
Analyst Price Target Analysis: Centerview reviewed stock price targets for the shares of Cornerstone
common stock in publicly available Wall Street research analyst reports, as of August 4, 2021, which
indicated low and high stock price targets for Cornerstone common stock ranging from $45.00 to $83.00 per
share; and
•
Precedent Premiums Paid Analysis: Centerview reviewed premiums paid in selected transactions
occurring in the ten (10) years prior to the date of Centerview’s opinion in which a public U.S.-based target
was acquired in a transaction valued from $2.5 billion to $10.0 billion and for which premium data was
available, excluding transactions in the financial services, real estate and energy sectors. The premiums in
this analysis were calculated by comparing the per share acquisition price in each transaction to, among
other things, the closing price of the target company’s common stock for the date one day prior to the date
on which the trading price of the target’s common stock was perceived to be affected by a potential
transaction. Based on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its
professional judgment, Centerview applied a range of 18% to 47% (representing the 25th and 75th percentile
of premiums) to the closing stock price of Cornerstone common stock on the Unaffected Date of $43.96,
which resulted in an implied per share price range of approximately $52.00 to $64.50 per share of
Cornerstone common stock.
General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it
considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of
Directors in its evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Board of Directors or the management of Cornerstone with respect to the Merger
Consideration or as to whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to determine that a different
consideration was fair. The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between
Cornerstone and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Centerview provided advice to Cornerstone
during these negotiations. Centerview did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to
Cornerstone or the Board of Directors or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the Transaction.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion,
Centerview was engaged to provide financial advisory services to Cornerstone, including in connection with its
acquisition of Saba in 2020, and Centerview has received approximately $9 million in compensation from Cornerstone
for such services. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview had not been engaged to
provide financial advisory or other services to Parent, Merger Sub or Clearlake, and Centerview had not received any
compensation from Parent, Merger Sub or Clearlake. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to
or with respect to Cornerstone or Parent or their respective affiliates and portfolio companies of Clearlake in the
future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview’s and its affiliates’ directors,
officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related
investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial
interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other
securities or financial instruments (including
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, Cornerstone, Parent, Clearlake or any of their
respective affiliates and portfolio companies of Clearlake, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.
The Board of Directors selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on
Centerview’s reputation and experience. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has
substantial experience in transactions similar to the Transaction.
In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to the Board of Directors, Cornerstone has agreed
to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of $24 million, $4 million of which was payable upon the rendering of
Centerview’s opinion and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In
addition, Cornerstone has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses arising, and to indemnify Centerview
against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.",57,64

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The
Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that they existed
at the time, in reaching the determination that the terms and conditions of the Merger and the Merger Agreement
were fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement. For additional information regarding the interests of our directors and
executive officers in the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of
Cornerstone’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
Arrangements with Parent
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or
any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving
Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to and following the Closing of the Merger, however, certain of our
executive officers may have discussions, and following the Closing of the Merger, may enter into agreements with,
Parent or Merger Sub, their subsidiaries or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to
purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Under the Merger Agreement, all existing rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation, for
acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, in favor of current and former directors and officers of
Cornerstone and its subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified Persons”), as provided in the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, or applicable governing documents of Cornerstone or its subsidiaries and as provided in the indemnification
agreements between Cornerstone and its subsidiaries and each Indemnified Person, will (i) survive the Merger, (ii) not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified
Persons, and (iii) be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under
Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective Time. Any claim made pursuant to such rights within such
six-year period will continue to be subject to the Merger Agreement and the rights provided under the Merger
Agreement until disposition of such claim.
Additionally, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, (A) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable legal requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director against all losses incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with any legal proceeding based on or arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Person was
a director or officer of Cornerstone or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Surviving
Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the existing policy of directors’
and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Cornerstone and its subsidiaries as of the date of the Merger
Agreement for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with respect
to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
55TABLE OF CONTENTS
their capacities as directors and officers of Cornerstone and its subsidiaries (as applicable), on terms with respect to
coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Cornerstone may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker) purchase a six-year “tail” policy for the
existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such “tail policy” has been obtained, it will be deemed to
satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-
Indemnification and Insurance.”
Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs
Cornerstone from time to time has granted awards under its equity incentive plans of Company Options and
Company RSUs.
As of August 20, 2021, there were 66,855,400 shares of common stock and 1,499,091 shares of common stock subject
to outstanding Company Options, and 5,656,280 shares of common stock subject to outstanding Company RSUs.
The Merger Agreement provides that each Vested Company RSU, Vested Company Option and Director RSU will be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
aggregate number of shares subject to, or issuable in settlement of, such award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, for each Company Option, the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Merger Consideration over such Company Option’s per share exercise price), subject to any required
withholding of taxes. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Common Stock.”
Each Unvested Award will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Unvested
Consideration Amount, which Unvested Consideration Amount will, be paid at the same time(s) that the unvested
awards would have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Unvested
Awards remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through
each such vesting date (except, that any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of
the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger will continue to apply to the Unvested
Consideration Amount). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Options (whether a Vested Company Option or an
Unvested Company Option) with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration will be cancelled immediately upon the Effective Time without payment or consideration. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Merger Consideration-Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs.”
Any Company Options (whether a Vested Company Option or an Unvested Company Option) with a per share
exercise price equal to or greater than $57.50 will be cancelled immediately upon the Effective Time without payment
or consideration.
Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control
Executive Change of Control Severance Agreements
Change of Control Severance Agreement with Philip S. Saunders
We entered into a change of control severance agreement with Philip S. Saunders, our chief executive officer,
effective as of May 3, 2021. Mr. Saunders’ change of control severance agreement provides that if his employment is
terminated by us or our successor without “cause” (excluding as a result of his death or “disability”) (each, as
defined in his change of control severance agreement), or by Mr. Saunders for “good reason” (as defined in his
change of control severance agreement) (in each case, a “qualifying termination”), and subject to Mr. Saunders
signing and not revoking a release of claims, Mr. Saunders will receive (i) a lump sum payment equal to 150% of Mr.
Saunders’ annual base salary as then in effect; (ii) a lump-sum amount equal to 150% of Mr. Saunders’ full target
annual bonus; (iii) if such termination occurs after the completion of a bonus period but prior to the payment of any
bonus, a lump-sum amount equal to the bonus Mr. Saunders would have received had he remained employed
through the bonus payment date and based on actual performance; (iv) reimbursement of COBRA continuation
premiums for up to 18 months for Mr. Saunders and his eligible dependents (provided he is eligible for and timely
elects COBRA continuation coverage), or, in the discretion of
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cornerstone, cash payments in lieu thereof; and (v) 18 months accelerated vesting of all then-unvested shares
subject to Mr. Saunders’ equity awards. However, if the qualifying termination occurs during the period that
commences three months prior to a “change of control” (as defined in his change of control and severance
agreement) and ends on the first anniversary following a change of control, then in addition to the benefits described
above, but excluding part (iii) above, (A) 100% of Mr. Saunders’ then unvested equity awards will vest in full,
provided that if the vesting of any such equity awards is to be determined based on the achievement of performance
criteria, then such equity award will vest as stated in the equity award, or if no such vesting is specified, then will
vest assuming the performance criteria had been achieved at 100% of target levels for the relevant performance
period or periods; and (B) Mr. Saunders’ unvested stock options or stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable
until the one year anniversary of the date of his termination of employment.
Change of Control Severance Agreements with Jeffrey Lautenbach, Chirag Shah, Mark Goldin, Heidi Sprigi and Adam
Weiss
In May 2021, we entered into change of control severance agreements with each of Jeffrey Lautenbach, our
president, Chirag Shah, our chief financial officer, Mark Goldin, our chief technology officer, Heidi Spirgi, our chief
strategy and growth officer, and Adam Weiss, our chief administrative officer and general counsel. Each such
executive’s change of control severance agreement provides that if his or her employment is terminated by us or our
successor without “cause” (excluding as a result of his or her death or “disability”) (each, as defined in their change
of control severance agreement), or by the executive for “good reason” (as defined in their change of control
severance agreement) (in each case, a “qualifying termination”), and subject to such executive signing and not
revoking a release of claims, each executive will receive (i) a lump sum payment equal to 100% of their annual base
salary as then in effect; (ii) if such termination occurs after the completion of a bonus period but prior to the payment
of any bonus, a lump-sum amount equal to the bonus such executive would have received had they remained
employed through the bonus payment date and based on actual performance; (iii) reimbursement of COBRA
continuation premiums for up to 12 months for the executive and their eligible dependents (provided they are eligible
for and timely elects COBRA continuation coverage), or, in the discretion of Cornerstone, cash payments in lieu
thereof; and (iv) 12 months accelerated vesting of all then-unvested shares subject to each executive’s equity
awards. However, if the qualifying termination occurs during the period that commences three months prior to a
“change of control” (as defined in their change of control and severance agreement) and ends on the first
anniversary following a change of control, then each executive will receive (A) a lump sum payment equal to 100% of
their annual base salary as then in effect; (B) a lump sum payment equal to 100% of their full annual target bonus; (C)
reimbursement of COBRA continuation premiums for up to 12 months for the executive and their eligible dependents
(provided they are eligible for and timely elects COBRA continuation coverage), or, in the discretion of Cornerstone,
cash payments in lieu thereof; (D)100% of the executive’s then unvested equity awards will vest in full, provided that
if the vesting of any such equity awards is to be determined based on the achievement of performance criteria, then
such equity award will vest as stated in the equity award, or if no such vesting is specified, then will vest assuming
the performance criteria had been achieved at 100% of target levels for the relevant performance period or periods;
and (E) the executive’s unvested stock options or stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable until the one year
anniversary of the date of their termination of employment.
Each executive officer’s change of control and severance agreement provides that, in the event any of the payments
provided for under the change of control severance agreement or otherwise payable to the executive officer would
constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and could be
subject to the related excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, they would be entitled to receive
either full payment of benefits or such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to
the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to the executive. However, please see the
section below, entitled “Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.”
Each executive officer’s receipt of the severance benefits under their change of control severance agreement is
subject to them signing a standard separation agreement and release of claims with Cornerstone and provided that
such release becomes effective and irrevocable no later than 60 days following their termination of employment. Each
executive officer is also subject to obligations related to non-solicitation of employees of Cornerstone and its
affiliates for a period of 12 months following the date the executive’s employment terminates for any reason, and the
provisions of an employee confidentiality, non-disclosure, and assignment of inventions agreement.
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For the purposes of each executive officer’s change of control severance agreement, “cause” generally means (i) an
act of material dishonesty made by the executive in connection with the executive’s carrying out his or her job
responsibilities to Cornerstone intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of the executive; (ii) the
executive’s conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to a felony which the Board of Directors reasonably believes
had or will have a material detrimental effect on Cornerstone’s reputation or business; (iii) a willful act by the
executive which constitutes gross misconduct and which is injurious to Cornerstone or its affiliates; (iv) the
executive’s willful and material breach of their change of control severance agreement, including without limitation,
their intentional failure to perform their stated duties, and their continued failure to cure such breach to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Directors within 10 days following written notice of such breach to the
executive; and (v) the executive’s material violation of a Company policy that results in a material detrimental effect
on Cornerstone’s reputation or business.
For the purposes of each executive officer’s change of control severance agreement, “good reason” generally means
the executive officer’s resignation within 30 days following the expiration of any cure period (discussed below)
following the occurrence of one or more of the following, without the executive officer’s express written consent: (i) a
significant reduction or adverse change in the executive’s duties, position, reporting relationship or responsibilities,
or the removal of the executive from such duties, position or responsibilities; (ii) a material reduction in the executive
officer’s base salary (except where there is a reduction applicable to the management team generally, such reduction
does not have a disproportionate effect on the executive in comparison to other members of the senior management
team, and such reduction does not to exceed 10% of the executive’s base salary); (iii) a reduction by Cornerstone in
the kind or level of benefits to which the executive is entitled with the result that the executive’s overall benefits
package is significantly reduced disproportionately to other members of senior management; (iv) a material breach by
Cornerstone of a term of any agreement between Cornerstone and the executive; and (v) the relocation of the
executive to a facility or location more than 35 miles from the executive’s present employment location. An executive
officer will not resign for “good reason” without first providing Cornerstone with written notice of the acts or
omissions constituting the grounds for “good reason” within 90 days of the initial existence of the grounds for
“good reason” and a reasonable cure period of 30 days following the date Cornerstone receives such notice during
which such condition must not have been cured.
Section 280G and 4999 of the Code
If Cornerstone determines that a member of senior management may become subject to an excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code in relation to “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code, Cornerstone may pay amounts
to the affected members of senior management that are sufficient to gross them up for any such excise taxes
(including any income taxes on such gross-up payments); provided that, (i) Cornerstone’s gross-up obligation
cannot exceed $7,000,000 in the aggregate, (ii) such cap will not be applicable with respect to gross-up payments paid
with respect to parachute payments associated with amounts and benefits provided by Parent pursuant to
compensation arrangements entered into with Parent in connection with the Merger, and (iii) no gross-up payment
shall be made in respect of any termination other than a termination by Parent (or an affiliate of Parent, or a successor
to Parent or such affiliate) without “cause” (as defined in such executive’s change of control severance agreement).
Quantification of Potential Payments to Certain Cornerstone Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to certain executive officers in connection with the
Merger. Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination At or Following
Change in Control” for further information regarding this compensation.
The table below assumes that: (i) for the purposes of this table only that, the Closing of the Merger occurs on
August 20, 2021; (ii) the employment of Messrs. Saunders, Lautenbach, Shah, Weiss and Goldin and Mses. Spirgi
and Coughlin be terminated immediately following the Closing of the Merger in a manner entitling the named
executive officer to receive the severance benefits described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control”; (iii) no named executive officer receives any
additional equity grants on or prior to the Closing of the Merger; and (iv) no named executive officer enters into new
agreements or is otherwise legally entitled to, prior to the Closing of the Merger,
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
additional compensation or benefits. Pursuant to applicable proxy disclosure rules, the value of the equity award
acceleration below is calculated based on the number of shares covered by the applicable Company Option or
Company RSU that are accelerating multiplied by $57.50 per share (less the applicable exercise price per share in the
case of Company Options). The amounts shown in the table below do not include the value of payments or benefits
that would have been earned, or any amounts associated with equity awards that would vest pursuant to their terms,
on or prior to the Closing of the Merger, or the value of payments or benefits that are not based on or otherwise
related to the Merger.
In addition to the assumptions described in the preceding paragraph, the amounts set forth in the table below are
based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. The
assumptions based upon which we have estimated the amounts in the table below may or may not actually occur.
Accordingly, the ultimate amounts to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may
differ from the amounts set forth below.

The amounts listed in this column for Messrs. Saunders, Lautenbach, Shah, Goldin, Weiss and Mses. Spirgi and Coughlin represent
the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which each of these named executive officers may become entitled under their
change of control severance agreement, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments
Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control”. To be eligible for such “double-trigger” cash severance benefits, the
employment of the named executive officer must terminate without “cause” or the executive officer must resign for “good
reason” (other than on account of death or disability) upon or during the period three months prior to and one year after a
“change in control” (as such terms are defined in the applicable change in control severance agreement and as described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control”) (for the purposes
of the table above, a “Qualifying CIC Termination”).
(2)
For each of Messrs. Saunders, Lautenbach, Shah, Goldin, Weiss and Mses. Spirgi and Coughlin the amount listed in this column
represents, in part, the estimated value of “double-trigger” vesting acceleration benefits to which they may become entitled under
their change of control severance agreement, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control”. To be eligible for such “double-trigger” benefits, the
employment of Messrs. Saunders, Lautenbach, Shah, Goldin, Weiss or Mses. Spirgi or Coughlin, as applicable, must terminate in a
Qualifying CIC Termination. For each of the named executive officers, the amount listed in this column also represents, in part,
the aggregate of the Vested Award Cash-out Payments that will be paid in cancellation of each then outstanding Vested Company
Option and Vested Company RSU held by the named executive officer immediately prior to the Closing of the Merger,
determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Treatment of Company Options and Company
RSUs”.
(3)
The amounts listed in this column represent the estimated value of the “double-trigger” reimbursement of continued health
coverage under COBRA benefits to which each of Messrs. Saunders, Lautenbach, Shah, Goldin, Weiss and Mses. Spirgi and
Coughlin may become entitled under their change of control severance agreement, as described in more detail in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “ -Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control”. To be eligible for such
“double-trigger” COBRA reimbursement benefits, the employment of the executive officer must terminate in a Qualifying CIC
Termination. The full amount represents the value of reimbursement of continued health coverage under COBRA based on the
applicable named executive officer’s estimated cost for such coverage as of September 30, 2021.
(4)
The amounts in this column represent an estimate of the full approximate tax reimbursement payment that could be paid to the
individual. However, some amounts might never be paid due to the triggering event (such as termination of employment) not
occurring, or the payment being reduced due to the $7,000,000 aggregate tax reimbursement cap as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “-Section 280G and 4999 of the Code”. Mr. Saunders’ estimated tax reimbursement (calculated to
equal $7,756,526) was reduced to $7,000,000 pursuant to the tax reimbursement cap as described in the preceding sentence. In
the absence of payment of a tax gross-up payment, under the change of control severance agreements of Messrs. Saunders,
Lautenbach, Shah, Goldin, Weiss and Mses. Spirgi and Coughlin, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named
executive officer would be better off on an after-tax basis being cut back than paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code.
Equity Awards Held by Cornerstone’s Executive Officers and Non-employee Directors
As discussed above at “Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs”, at the Effective Time, each Vested
Award (including those held by our executive officers and non-employee directors) will be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive the applicable Vested Award Cash-out Payment, and each
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Unvested Award (including those held by our executive officers) will be cancelled and automatically converted into
the right to receive the an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares subject to, or
issuable in settlement of, such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (or, for each Company Option, the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such
Company Option’s per share exercise price), subject to any required withholding of taxes and subject to the vesting
conditions (including any accelerated vesting on specific terminations of employment) and payment terms described
above.
Each of our executive officers is eligible to receive the applicable vesting acceleration benefits with respect to his or
her equity awards described above under the heading “Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in
Control”.

The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock
underlying equity awards held by each of Cornerstone’s executive officers and non-employee directors that are
outstanding as of August 20, 2021. The table also sets forth the values of these shares and equity awards,

Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Cornerstone that they will have available to them, together with
Cornerstone’s cash on hand, sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the
Merger by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement. This includes funds needed to: (i) pay Cornerstone
stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their respective common stock, (ii) make payments in
respect of our outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs payable at Closing and (iii) make payments of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger pursuant to the Indenture and the Cornerstone
Convertible Notes. We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related
transactions, including to pay the Merger Consideration, make the required payments with respect to Company
Options and Company RSUs payable at Closing, repay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness and to make
Options and Company RSUs payable at Closing, repay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness and to make
payments required with respect to the Cornerstone Convertible Notes, as well as to pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid at the Closing of the Merger by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger
Agreement, will be approximately $5,300,000,000.

Letter (ii) preferred equity to be provided by the Investors pursuant to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and
(iii) debt financing to be provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter by the lenders party thereto. In
connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to Cornerstone copies of the
Financing Letters. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters) by or to Parent
or any of its affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing
Merger Sub has entered into the Debt Commitment Letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A.
and certain other financial institutions (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, the lenders thereunder have committed to provide debt financing in an aggregate
principal
61TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount of up to $3,187,500,000, of which up to $2,937,500,000 will be available at Closing to consummate the Merger
and pay related fees, costs and expenses. The Lenders’ obligation to provide the Debt Financing is subject to certain
conditions, including, but not limited to, the following (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter):

continuing;
•
the substantially simultaneous closing of the Merger in accordance in all material respects with the Merger
Agreement;
•
the substantially concurrent funding of the Equity Financing under the Clearlake Equity Commitment
Letter;

the substantially concurrent refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of the Company, including certain
amendments to the Indenture governing the Cornerstone Convertible Notes to facilitate the consummation
of the Merger and the financing relating thereto as described further under the caption, “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Cornerstone Convertible Notes”;
•
the Lenders having been afforded a marketing period of 15 consecutive business days (subject to certain
blackout dates) following receipt of certain required financial information regarding Cornerstone and
commencing on the later of September 8, 2021 and the first business day after the date Cornerstone files the
definitive proxy statement for the Special Meeting;
•
the receipt of certain specified financial statements of the Company;

(i) five business days after February 5, 2022 (as such date may be extended in accordance with the Merger Agreement
as in effect on the date of the Debt Commitment Letter), (ii) the initial funding date of the Debt Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) five business days following the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms without the funding of the Debt Financing, and (iv) the consummation of the Merger without the
funding of the debt commitment.
As of the date hereof, the documentation governing the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the Debt Financing may differ from those described
in this proxy statement.
Equity Financing
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantors have delivered the Clearlake Equity
Commitment Letter to Parent, and the Investors have provided a Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to

committed to contribute, the Guarantors have committed to contribute an aggregate amount of up to $1,935,000,000,
and the Investors have committed to contribute an aggregate amount of up to $700,000,000, respectively, to Parent in
connection with the Merger solely for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. The Guarantors may assign
some or all of their respective obligations under the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter to any of their respective
affiliates, co-investment funds or, subject to certain conditions being met, other investors.
The obligation of the Guarantors to fund the equity commitment under the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter is
subject to the following conditions:

Agreement; and
•
the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the aggregate amount committed pursuant to the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter is funded at the
Closing or has been previously funded.
The obligation of each Guarantor to fund the equity commitment under the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter will

commitment, (ii) the consummation of the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (iii) the valid termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (iv) Cornerstone commencing any legal proceeding to enforce the
payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee under the Limited Guarantee or (v) Cornerstone or any of

transaction contemplated thereby.
Cornerstone is an express third-party beneficiary of the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter solely with respect to
enforcing Parent’s right to cause the commitment under the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter by each Guarantor to
be funded to Parent in accordance with the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter, and to cause Parent to enforce its
rights against such Guarantor to perform its funding obligations under the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter, in
each case subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set forth in the Clearlake Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
The obligation of the Investors to provide the Preferred Equity Financing under the Preferred Equity Commitment
Letter is subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the following (subject to certain exceptions and
qualifications as set forth in the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter):
•
no company material adverse effect will have occurred after the date of the Merger Agreement that is
continuing;
•
the substantially simultaneous closing of the Merger in accordance in all material respects with the Merger
Agreement;
•
the receipt of certain specified financial statements of the Company;
•
the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the preferred equity;
•
the substantially concurrent making of the Equity Financing pursuant to the Clearlake Equity Commitment
Letter and the funding of the Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter; and
•
the substantially concurrent refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of the Company (as described
further under the caption, “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Cornerstone
Convertible Notes”).
The Investors’ commitments under the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter automatically terminate upon the earliest
to occur of: (i) five business days after February 5, 2022 (as such date may be extended in accordance with the
Merger Agreement as in effect on the date of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter), (ii) the initial funding date of
the Preferred Equity Financing under the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, (iii) five business days following the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms without the funding of the Preferred Equity
Financing, and (iv) the consummation of the Merger without the funding of the preferred equity commitment.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantors have entered into the Limited Guarantee,
pursuant to which such Guarantors have agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to guarantee the payment and
performance of such Guarantor’s respective percentage of Parent’s obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee and
enforcement expenses related to the Parent Termination Fee and reimburse and indemnify

Cornerstone with respect to certain expenses in connection with Parent’s Debt Financing. The Guarantors may assign
some or all of their respective obligations under the Limited Guarantee to any of their respective affiliates, co-
investment funds or, subject to certain conditions being met, other investors.
The guaranteed obligations of the Guarantors are subject to an aggregate cap in the amount of $322,000,000 and an
individual cap applicable to each Guarantor equal to such Guarantor’s specified percentage share of the guaranteed
obligations. The Limited Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:
•
the Closing of the Merger;
•
the receipt by Cornerstone or its affiliates of an indefeasible payment of each Guarantor’s respective
proportion of the guaranteed obligations, subject to the caps described above; or
•
the date that is 90 days following the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
unless prior to such date Cornerstone has delivered a written notice with respect to non-payment of any of
the guaranteed obligations and commenced a legal proceeding against the Guarantors or Parent alleging
that any guaranteed obligation is due and owing from the Guarantors.",72,73

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Signing Securityholders have entered into the
Support Agreements.
As of the close of business on the Record Date, the Signing Stockholders held, in the aggregate, approximately
10,442,350 shares of common stock, representing approximately 15.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Under the Voting and Support Agreements, the Signing Stockholders have
agreed to, during the term of such agreements, vote the Signing Stockholders’ shares of common stock (i) in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement;(ii) against any action or agreement which would result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of Cornerstone in the Merger Agreement; and/or (iii) against any alternative
acquisition proposals and any action which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with,
delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger. In addition, the Silver Lake Support Agreements require
the Silver Lake Group (y) subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer or convert into common stock their
Cornerstone Convertible Notes and (z) to support certain amendments to the Indenture to facilitate the
consummation of the Merger and the financing relating thereto.
Appraisal Rights",73,73
Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders of the Company (i) who continuously
hold shares of Cornerstone common stock through the Effective Time, (ii) who did not vote their shares in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, (iv) who otherwise properly comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the
DGCL; and (v) who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares, fail to perfect or otherwise
lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to demand
appraisal of their shares and receive, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the “fair value”
of their shares (as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any), as determined by the Delaware Court, in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their shares could be more than, the
same as or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to,
and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the
exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the
procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.
The following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy as Annex D. This summary
does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the
DGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder
of shares immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as
64TABLE OF CONTENTS
to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person holding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name
of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the stockholder of record to follow the
steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to follow any of the
procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in termination or waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that the Company will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any
stockholder.
Any stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the
DGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that
Company stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger is approved under Section 251(h), either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger, or the surviving corporation within 10 days thereafter, shall notify each of the
stockholders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the required copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. Any stockholder who wishes to exercise
such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the following discussion
and Annex D carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified may result in the
loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the
following:
•
deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Cornerstone common stock prior
to the later of the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and 20 days after the mailing of this
proxy statement. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or
vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting “AGAINST” or
failing to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for
appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL;
•
not vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
continuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made
through the Effective Time of the Merger; and
•
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including
filing of a petition in the Delaware Court requesting a determination of the fair value of your shares of
common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger.
Within 10 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the effective
date of the Merger to those stockholders of the Company who have properly made a written demand for appraisal
pursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, has not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and has not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is consummated,
a failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above
(or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your
appraisal rights. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any stockholder who has
demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, without interest, specified by
the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective
Time of the Merger will require the written approval of the Surviving Corporation and no appraisal proceeding before
the Delaware Court as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court. Such
approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court deems just; provided, however, that this provision
will not affect the right of any stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined such
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in
the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a
stockholder’s request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when the approval is required or if the Delaware Court does
not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised
value determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the
value of the per share Merger Consideration.
Written Demand by the Stockholder
All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to the Company, 1601 Cloverfield Blvd., Suite 620 South Santa
Monica, California 90404. Attention: General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the
stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder’s name appears on the stockholder’s certificates
(whether in book entry or on physical certificates) evidencing such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of
record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,
the demand must be made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners,
may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record, but such agent must identify the record owner or
owners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of
such shares.
A beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions
as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If
shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central
securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on
behalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any
beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible
for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record. The beneficial holder of the
shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record
of the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.
A record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee
for several beneficial owners (may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial
owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the
written demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for
appraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such
stockholder.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court demanding a determination of the fair
value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their shares in favor of the
Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period,
appraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. The
Company is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and stockholders should not
assume that the Company will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal
rights in respect of the shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements for
exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and with respect to which Cornerstone has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of
stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been
received by the Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for
appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of
shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been
properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person's own name, file a petition for appraisal or request
from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the
petition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the “Verified List”) containing the names
and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the “Dissenting Stockholders”)
and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a petition by a
Dissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing on the petition will be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders shown on the
Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the
Delaware Court. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
If a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court is empowered to determine which Dissenting Stockholders
have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their shares. The
Delaware Court may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their Share certificates, if any, to the Delaware
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court is
empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does not comply with such
requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their Share certificates after the Effective
Time and thereafter comply with all orders of the Delaware Court in respect of such certificates. In addition, assuming
the shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the Effective Time, which we expect to
be the case, the Delaware Court is required to dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders
unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal
or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court will determine the fair value of the shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the
date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time
of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid
by the Surviving Corporation and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court, and (ii) interest
accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc.,
the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court must consider market value, asset
value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of
the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. In Weinberger, the
Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which
are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.” Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion that does not
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from
such accomplishment or expectation. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial
point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the
DGCL. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be
more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under
the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,
the Delaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the Verified List and who has
submitted such stockholder’s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights.
When the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such value, with
interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or
upon surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates. The Delaware Court’s decree may be enforced
as other decrees in the Delaware Court may be enforced. The Delaware Court may also (i) determine the costs of the
proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the
parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder, order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations
by the Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Stockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined
under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to
be paid in the Merger. Although the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is
made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court. Neither Parent nor the
Company anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and each of Parent
and the Company reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the
DGCL, the “fair value” of the shares is less than the Merger Consideration.
The process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites.
Stockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL
will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date
prior to the Effective Time.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully
withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares will be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, the stockholder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as the Company has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present
intention to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely basis. In addition, a
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger
Consideration by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for appraisal and
acceptance of the terms of the Merger either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with
the written approval of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court
will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
deems just; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the effective date of
the Merger.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL
NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL
RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
The foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of the Company to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law
does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of the Company
desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section
262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this Proxy.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be
relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are
converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This summary is general in nature and does not
discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a stockholder in light of its particular
circumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income
taxation. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject
to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to
holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax
laws, such as:
•
banks or other financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; retirement or other tax deferred accounts; S
corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or other pass-through entities) or an investor in a partnership,
S corporation (or other pass-through entity);
•
insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use
the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate
investment trusts;
•
entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United
States;
•
except as noted below, holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent
or more of Cornerstone’s common stock (by vote or value);
•
tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,
straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
•
tax consequences to holders whose shares constitute qualified small business stock within the meaning of
Section 1202 of the Code;
•
tax consequences to holders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction,
through a tax qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;

•
tax consequences to holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the
Surviving Corporation following the Merger;
•
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other
entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the shares of common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement”
(as defined in the Code);

tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and properly demand appraisal of their
shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or that entered into a support agreement as part of the transaction
described in this proxy statement.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the
consequences of the Merger.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views
expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A
SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX PLANNING AND ADVICE. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX
ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT
AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR
NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of shares (that is,
shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the
amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain
70
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one
year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are currently
taxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a
Non-U.S. Holder. The term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, not a U.S. Holder nor an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Special rules, not discussed herein, may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders, such as:
•
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
controlled foreign corporations;
•
passive foreign investment companies;
•
corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; and
•
pass-through entities, or investors in such entities.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed
base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder
is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate
under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty),
which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-U.S.
Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or
•
Cornerstone is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (“USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the
Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock
(the “Relevant Period”) and, if shares of Cornerstone’s common stock are regularly traded on an
established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder
owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of our common stock at any
time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates
generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch
profits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not,
and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a
holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a certification of such holder’s
foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise
establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
71
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The foregoing summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular
holders of common stock. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences
to them of exchanging their common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger under any federal, state, local or non-U.S.
tax laws.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain
payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution
enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the
U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes
certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with
U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on
certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a
certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
Subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations described below, FATCA will apply to gross proceeds from sales or
other dispositions of common stock after December 31, 2018. The Treasury Department released proposed
regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of 30% applicable to
the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the
U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations
are issued.
Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of
FATCA on the disposition of common stock pursuant to the Merger.

Cornerstone OnDemand Inc_20210910_DEFM14A_19526835_4292932.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Cornerstone and Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisitions may not be completed until
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal
Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the applicable HSR Act waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting
period under the HSR Act is 30 calendar days, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or extended. The Merger
is subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until each of Cornerstone and
Clearlake file a notification and report form with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting
period has expired or been terminated. Cornerstone and Clearlake made the necessary filings with the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ and the FTC on August 19, 2021.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding
the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign jurisdiction could take
such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could
include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be
certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
German Antitrust Approval
German Arc imposes a pre-merger notification requirement on transactions that qualify as concentrations in the
meaning of the law and meet certain specified turnover or transaction value thresholds, which the present
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger meets. Accordingly, consummation of the merger is conditional upon the merger being cleared by the FCO.
Clearance is considered granted if, after a transaction has been notified, the applicable one-month waiting period
expires without the decision by the FCO to open Phase II proceedings or if the FCO explicitly clears the transaction
before the expiration of the waiting period. If the FCO initiates Phase II proceedings, clearance is granted by way of a
formal decision, or, if the decision is not served upon the notifying undertakings within a period of five months from
receipt of the complete notification, is deemed to be granted. Clearlake notified the FCO of the proposed transaction
on August 23, 2021 and received clearance for the transaction from the FCO on September 3, 2021.
Austrian Antitrust Approval
The Austrian Cartel Act imposes a pre-merger notification requirement on transactions that qualify as concentrations
in the meaning of the law and meet certain specified turnover or transaction value thresholds, which the present
merger meets. Accordingly, consummation of the merger requires notification of the merger to the
Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde (Austrian Federal Competition Authority, “FCA”), Clearance is considered granted if,
after a transaction has been notified, the applicable four week waiting period expires without the FCA or the
Bundeskartellanwalt (Federal Cartel Prosecutor) applying to open Phase II proceedings, or if they waive the opening
of Phase II proceedings prior to the expiry of that waiting period. If Phase II proceedings are initiated, clearance is
granted by way of a formal decision of the Austrian Cartel Court, or, if the decision is not taken within a period of five
months, is deemed to be granted. Clearlake notified the FCA of the proposed transaction on August 23, 2021.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when
it grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or
litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude
obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the
required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial
period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These
conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

contractual risk between Cornerstone, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be
subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.
Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the

after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement
as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Cornerstone, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may
take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the Merger
Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice
to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with

Company of the Transactions, except that, with respect to clause (i) only, none of the following, and no effect arising
out of, relating to or resulting from the following, will be deemed in and of themselves, either alone or in combination,

Cornerstone and its subsidiaries:
(a)
any change in the market price or trading volume of Cornerstone’s stock;

any Effect resulting or arising from Parent’s or Merger Sub’s breach of the Merger Agreement;
(i)
any Effect arising from or relating to any change in, or any compliance with or action taken for the purpose

reasonably likely to be a Material Adverse Effect, and it being understood further that, with respect to the

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means any customary confidentiality agreement that (i) contains provisions
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Cornerstone and its subsidiaries than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement dated June 2, 2021, between the Company and Clearlake (except that the confidentiality
agreement need not contain standstill provisions) and (ii) does not prohibit Cornerstone from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement or otherwise prohibit Cornerstone from complying
with its obligations under the Merger Agreement.
“Acquisition Proposal” means any proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent and its affiliates) or “group”,
within the meaning of Section 23(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any direct or indirect:
•
acquisition of assets of Cornerstone and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis equal to 20% or more of
Cornerstone and its subsidiaries’ assets on a consolidated basis or to which 20% or more of Cornerstone
and its subsidiaries’ revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable;
•
issuance by Cornerstone of 20% or more of the outstanding shares,
•
recapitalization, tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares or
•
merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Cornerstone that if consummated would result in any person or
group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares, in each case other than the
Transactions.
“Superior Offer” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors (or committee thereof)
determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and
financing aspects (including certainty of closing) of the proposal and the person making the proposal and other
aspects of the Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors deems relevant, would result in a transaction more
favorable to Cornerstone’s stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including after giving effect to proposals, if any, made by
Parent). For purposes of the definition of “Superior Offer”, the references to “20% or more” in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal are deemed to be references to “more than 50%.”
During the Pre-Closing Period, Cornerstone and its subsidiaries have agreed not to, and to cause its representatives
not to:
•
engage or continue any solicitation, knowing encouragement, knowing facilitation (including by providing
non-public information), discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal;
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate, induce, assist or encourage (including by furnishing non-public
information) any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (each an “Inquiry”) or the making, submission
or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry;
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person any non-public information relating to Cornerstone or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any
other person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or
to any personnel, of Cornerstone or any of its subsidiaries, in each case in connection with or for the
purpose of knowingly encouraging, assisting, inducing or facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal or any
Inquiry;
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
enter into, approve or endorse any contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company
to abandon or terminate the Transactions (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), or enter into any
related discussions with respect thereto, that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal;
•
enter into any contract that would expressly prohibit Cornerstone or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
representatives from complying with their obligations to Parent under the Merger Agreement (other than an
unintentional and immaterial breach);
•
take any action to exempt any person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) from any takeover law; or
•
agree, propose or resolve to take, or take any of the foregoing prohibited actions.
In addition, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, Cornerstone and its subsidiaries agreed to direct their respective
representatives to (i) cease any solicitations, discussions, communications or negotiations with any persons that
may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any Inquiry, (ii) promptly deliver a written ‘return or
destroy confidential information’ notice, which will also state that Cornerstone is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, to each person that entered into a
confidentiality agreement in anticipation of potentially making an Acquisition Proposal within the last six months,
and (iii) terminate data room access previously granted to any persons and its representatives (other than Parent and
its representatives) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal.
If at any time after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the receipt of the required stockholder approval, if
Cornerstone, its subsidiaries or any of their representatives receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from
any person or group of persons, which was made on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and did not result
from any breach of the non-solicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement (other than unintentional and immaterial
breach), Cornerstone and its representatives may take the actions listed below if, and only if, the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer and the failure to take any of the
following actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable legal requirements (a “Qualifying Acquisition Proposal”), then Cornerstone and its representatives may
prior to (but not after) receipt of the required stockholder approval, subject to compliance with the non-solicitation
obligations, (i) furnish, pursuant to (but only pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to Cornerstone and its subsidiaries to the person or group of persons
who has made such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal, provided that Cornerstone will concurrently provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning Cornerstone and its subsidiaries that is provided to any person given such
access which was not previously provided to Parent or its representatives, and (ii) engage in discussions and
negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal with respect to such
Qualifying Acquisition Proposal.
Relatedly, following the date of the Merger Agreement, Cornerstone has also agreed to provide prompt written notice
(and in any event within 24 hours) to Parent in the event any Inquiries or Acquisition Proposals (including non-
public information requests related to any Inquiries or Acquisition Proposals) are received by Cornerstone, its
subsidiaries or any of their representatives or any discussions or negotiations relating to or in connection with any
Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal are sought, requested or continued, which notice will include (i) the identity of the
third party making the Inquiry, providing the Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information, (ii) a
summary of the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, and (iii) copies of all draft
acquisition agreements and other documents or materials with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry.
Cornerstone has also agreed to keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, on the status and terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and any negotiations related thereto, including providing drafts of Alternative
Acquisition Agreements, financing commitments and other agreements and other documents relating to such
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and notifying Parent reasonably promptly of any non-public information requests.
As described below under the caption “-Termination Fee”, if Cornerstone terminates the Merger Agreement after the
date of the Merger Agreement but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cornerstone’s stockholders for
the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Offer, Cornerstone must pay a $150,000,000
termination fee to Parent.

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the
recommendation that the holders of Cornerstone common stock vote “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement. The
Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
(as defined below) except as described below.
During the Pre-Closing Period, the Board of Directors may not take any action described in the following (any such
action, a “Company Adverse Change Recommendation”):
•
fail to make, withhold, withdraw, or publicly propose to fail to make, withhold, withdraw (or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Board of Directors’ recommendation;
•
fail to include the Board of Directors’ recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend, endorse or declare
advisable, any Acquisition Proposal, or if any tender offer or exchange offer is commenced for equity
securities of Cornerstone, fail to recommend against such tender offer or exchange offer by the earlier of (i)
the 10th business day after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer or (ii) the 3rd business day
prior to the Special Meeting;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Board of Directors’ recommendation within five business days after Parent
requests in writing; or
•
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
The Board of Directors also agreed not to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow Cornerstone to execute or enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the required
stockholder approval if Cornerstone has received a written Qualifying Acquisition Proposal from any person that has
not been withdrawn and after consultation with outside legal counsel, and the Board of Directors has determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (i) the Board of Directors may make a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation or (ii) Cornerstone may terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an
agreement with respect to such Superior Offer in accordance with the Merger Agreement if and only if:
•
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Cornerstone’s outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors to Cornerstone’s stockholders under applicable legal requirements;
•
Cornerstone provides Parent with prior written notice of its intention to consider making a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement at least four business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination to the Merger Agreement (a
“Determination Notice”);
•
Cornerstone provides to Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
the latest drafts of the definitive agreement to effect such Superior Offer, any financing commitments or
other agreements to be entered into in connection with such Superior Offer;
•
Cornerstone provides Parent four business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of the Merger Agreement or make another proposal, and makes its representatives reasonably
available to negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to the proposed revisions or other proposal, if
any; and
•
the Board of Directors, after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent, if any, and consulting with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
determines, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to Cornerstone’s stockholders under applicable legal
requirements.
83TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cornerstone may issue any “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) to the extent such
communication expressly reaffirms the Board of Directors’ recommendation, which under the Merger Agreement is
not, in and of itself, considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and will not require a Determination
Notice.
Additionally, the Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a
Change in Circumstance, if and only if:
•
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Cornerstone’s outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors to Cornerstone’s stockholders under applicable legal requirements;
•
Cornerstone provides Parent a Determination Notice at least four business days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation;
•
Cornerstone specifies the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail;
•
Cornerstone provides Parent four business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of the Merger Agreement or make another proposal, so that such Change in Circumstances would no
longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and makes its representatives
reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to the proposed revisions or other
proposal, if any; and
•
the Board of Directors, after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent, if any, and consulting with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
determines, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in
response to such Change in Circumstance would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors to the Cornerstone stockholders under applicable legal requirements.
For the purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, “Change in Circumstances” means any Effect
that materially affects the business, assets or operations of Cornerstone and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that
was neither known to the Board of Directors nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement, which Effect becomes known to the Board of Directors prior to the required stockholder approval, with
none of the following constituting a “Change in Circumstance”: (i) any Acquisition Proposal, Inquiry or any business
combination or acquisition opportunity, (ii) any Effect resulting from a breach of the Merger Agreement by

affiliate thereof) during such period (each, a “Continuing Employee”) (i) a base salary (or base wages, as the case
may be, other than equity compensation or equity-based arrangements or long term incentive opportunities) and
annual cash target bonus opportunity or annual commission opportunity (as the case may be) that is no less
favorable than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be), annual cash target bonus opportunity or annual

does not comply with applicable legal requirements.
Additionally, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and instruct its affiliates to, as applicable (and

welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees participated
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan will, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time off), credit
Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with Cornerstone to the same extent
that such service and amounts paid was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or
welfare benefit plan of Cornerstone, in each case, with respect to the non-U.S. Continuing Employees, to the extent
required under applicable legal requirements.

liability insurance maintained by Cornerstone and its subsidiaries as of the date of the Merger Agreement for the
benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and officers of Cornerstone and its
subsidiaries (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the
existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Cornerstone may (through a nationally recognized
insurance broker) purchase a six-year “tail” policy for the existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if
such “tail policy” has been obtained, it will be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In no event, however, will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by Cornerstone and its subsidiaries
with respect to such current policy, and if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
equal to such amount.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Cornerstone is required to
submit a proposal to our stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to Cornerstone’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation is summarized in the
section captioned “The Merger-Interests of Cornerstone’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The
Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation
information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, the Company is asking you to approve the following
resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Cornerstone approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that
will or may become payable to Cornerstone’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled ‘The Merger-Interest of
Cornerstone’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger’.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote
not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is
advisory only, it will not be binding on Cornerstone. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the
Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless
of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.

Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
outstanding shares of Cornerstone’s common stock representing a majority of the voting power of such outstanding
shares present at the meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (i)
a failure to vote virtually in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal, (ii) abstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a
vote against the Compensation Proposal and (iii) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of
the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Cornerstone common stock represented by properly executed, timely received
and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Cornerstone
stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of
Cornerstone common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of
Directors.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if the Board of
Directors determines that it is necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If the Board of Directors determines that it
is necessary or appropriate, we will ask our stockholders to vote only on this Adjournment Proposal and not to vote
on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the
Compensation Proposal.
In the Adjournment Proposal, we are asking our stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize the Board of
Directors, in its discretion, to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to
solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the
Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be
defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to
convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of
the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually in person or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

proposal.

discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition,
operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our Board of

The submission deadline for stockholder proposals to be included in our proxy materials for our 2022 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act is December 22, 2021 except as may otherwise
be provided in Rule 14a-8. All such proposals must be in writing and received by our Secretary at Cornerstone
OnDemand, Inc., 1601 Cloverfield Blvd., Suite 620 South, Santa Monica, California 90404 by close of business on the
required deadline in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for our 2022 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. Submission of a proposal before the deadline does not guarantee its inclusion in our proxy materials.
Advance Notice Procedure for 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
Under our bylaws, director nominations and other business may be brought at an annual meeting of stockholders
only by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or by a stockholder entitled to vote who has submitted a
proposal in accordance with the requirements of our bylaws as in effect from time to time. For our 2022 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholder notice must be received by our Secretary at Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.,
1601 Cloverfield Blvd., Suite 620 South, Santa Monica, California 90404, no earlier than February 5, 2022 and no later
than March 7, 2022 being, respectively, 75 days and 45 days prior to the date of the first anniversary of the date our
proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders was mailed.
However, if the date of our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is advanced by more than 30 days prior to or
delayed by more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, then, for
notice by the stockholder to be timely, it must be received by our Secretary not earlier than the close of business on
the 120th day prior to our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and not later than the close of business on the later
of (i) the 90th day prior to our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or (ii) the tenth day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made. Please refer to the full text of our advance
notice provisions in section 2.4 of our bylaws for additional information and requirements. Please note that if we hold
our regular annual stockholders meeting in 2022, and we do so more than 30 days before or after June 8, 2022 (the
one-year anniversary date of the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders), we will disclose the new deadline by which
stockholder proposals must be received under Item 5 of Part II of our earliest possible Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
or, if impracticable, by any means reasonably determined to inform stockholders.
Alternatively, under our bylaws, if a stockholder would like to propose a matter for presentation at our 2022 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders meeting in 2022 (if held), rather than for inclusion in the proxy materials, the stockholder
must follow certain procedures contained in our bylaws.
In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a
new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice under our bylaws. A copy of our amended and restated
bylaws may be obtained by accessing our filings on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You may also contact our
Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices set forth above for a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions
regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating director candidates.

Members of the Board:
We understand that Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Sunshine Software
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Sunshine Software Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) dated as of August 5, 2021, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company (the “Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and
after the effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share
of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than (a) Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the
Merger Agreement), (b) Parent-held Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), or (c)
shares held in treasury by the Company, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount
equal to $57.50, without interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are
more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and
certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have
also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the
Company, including financial projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”).
Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the
Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity
for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading
activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities.
In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have
deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed
with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the
Company, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the
Company and other matters covered thereby. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have
assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the

Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have
relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing
and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which will become payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger
fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us
for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material
relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which
compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the
future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Parent and their respective
affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion
is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without
our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the
Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company Common Stock will trade
at any time.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion
and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this
opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or
the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our
opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant
to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with
respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be
received by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such Holders.
Yours faithfully,

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below),
of Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of the $57.50 per Share in cash, without
interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”)
proposed to be entered into by and among Sunshine Software Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”),
Sunshine Software Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(“Merger Sub”), and the Company. The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the
“Transaction”), as a result of which the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and
each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) any Parent-
held Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Agreement) or Shares held in the Company’s treasury and (ii)
Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the Agreement) (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), together,
“Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive $57.50 per Share in cash, without interest (the $57.50
per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our
services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of
our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the past two years, we have been engaged to provide
financial advisory services to the Company, including in connection with its acquisition of Saba Software in 2020, and
we have received compensation from the Company for such services. In the past two years, we have not been
engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent, Merger Sub or Clearlake Capital Group, L.P.
(“Sponsor”), the sponsor of Parent, and we have not received any compensation from Parent, Merger Sub or
Sponsor. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company or Parent or their
respective affiliates and portfolio companies of Sponsor in the future, for which we may receive compensation.
Certain (i) of our and our affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons,
(ii) of our affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the
foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade,
in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations)
of, or investments in, the Company, Parent, Sponsor or any of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies of
Sponsor, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated August 5,
2021 (the “Draft Agreement”); (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31,
2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018; (iii) certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q of the Company; (iv) certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; (v) certain other
communications from the Company to its stockholders; and (vi) certain internal

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below),
of Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of the $57.50 per Share in cash, without
interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”)
proposed to be entered into by and among Sunshine Software Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”),
Sunshine Software Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(“Merger Sub”), and the Company. The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the
“Transaction”), as a result of which the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and
each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) any Parent-
held Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Agreement) or Shares held in the Company’s treasury and (ii)
Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the Agreement) (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), together,
“Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive $57.50 per Share in cash, without interest (the $57.50
per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our
services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of
our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the past two years, we have been engaged to provide
financial advisory services to the Company, including in connection with its acquisition of Saba Software in 2020, and
we have received compensation from the Company for such services. In the past two years, we have not been
engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent, Merger Sub or Clearlake Capital Group, L.P.
(“Sponsor”), the sponsor of Parent, and we have not received any compensation from Parent, Merger Sub or
Sponsor. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company or Parent or their
respective affiliates and portfolio companies of Sponsor in the future, for which we may receive compensation.
Certain (i) of our and our affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons,
(ii) of our affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the
foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade,
in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations)
of, or investments in, the Company, Parent, Sponsor or any of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies of
Sponsor, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated August 5,
2021 (the “Draft Agreement”); (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31,
2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018; (iii) certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q of the Company; (iv) certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; (v) certain other
communications from the Company to its stockholders; and (vi) certain internal

information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company,
including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the Company prepared by management of
the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the “Forecasts”) (collectively, the
“Internal Data”). We have also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and
representatives of the Company regarding their assessment of the Internal Data. In addition, we reviewed publicly
available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for the Company and compared that data with
similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that we
deemed relevant. We also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the financial
terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant and conducted such
other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as we deemed appropriate.
We have assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by us
for purposes of this opinion and have, with your consent, relied upon such information as being complete and
accurate. In that regard, we have assumed, at your direction, that the Internal Data (including, without limitation, the
Forecasts) has been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby and we have relied, at your direction, on the
Internal Data for purposes of our analysis and this opinion. We express no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or
the assumptions on which it is based. In addition, at your direction, we have not made any independent evaluation or
appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company,
nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and we have not been asked to conduct, and did
not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. We have assumed, at your direction,
that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any respect material to our analysis or this opinion from the Draft
Agreement reviewed by us. We have also assumed, at your direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on
the terms set forth in the Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or
requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect
of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay,
limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to our analysis
or this opinion. We have not evaluated and do not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of the
Company, or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the
Transaction on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisors, and we express no opinion as to any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the Company’s underlying business decision to
proceed with or effect the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative
business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage.
This opinion is limited to and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, to the
holders of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant
to the Agreement. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does not address,
any other term or aspect of the Agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the structure or form of
the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Agreement or entered into in
connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the
Transaction or any other term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection
therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any
of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any party, or class of such persons in connection with the
Transaction, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Shares pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and
other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof,
and we do not have any obligation or responsibility to

update, revise or reaffirm this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date
hereof. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person
as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to
the Transaction or any other matter.
Our financial advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of
the Board of Directors of the Company (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection
with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The issuance of this opinion was approved by the
Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Agreement is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,

case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months; provided, further, that no gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder.
(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of any
Share (or Shares) entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5 (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, does not include the Parent-held Company Shares) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in
reasonable and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such Shares (the “Certificates”) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book Entry
Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that
A-3TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that any such
Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.6(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which such Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.5.
(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying
Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such shares to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at
such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving
Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with
respect to the Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.
(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from any cash amounts payable to any holder of Shares,
Company Options or RSUs such amounts as it is required by any applicable Tax Legal Requirements to deduct
and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that
any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any
withholding obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable
payor, such payor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to request such information from such payee and
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the applicable payee with reducing or obtaining an exemption from
such withholding obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Body in accordance with applicable Tax Legal Requirements, such amounts so remitted shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.
(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed
the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 1.",119,120

shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall

provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL or other applicable Legal Requirements that relates to such demand, and Parent
will have the opportunity and right to participate in and, after the Effective Time direct, all negotiations and Legal

set forth in this Section 1.8(a). As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each Vested Company Option that is
then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
fully Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A)
the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price payable per Share under such Vested Company Option,
which amount (less applicable withholding Taxes) shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.8(c) (the “Option
Consideration”). Each portion of a Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested
Company Option”) shall be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Option Consideration the holder of the Unvested Company Option would have received had the
Unvested Company Option been a Vested Company Option (the “Unvested Option Consideration”), provided
that the payment of the Unvested Option Consideration shall be made at the same time(s) (and consistent with
the applicable payment method described in Section 1.8(c)) that the Unvested Company Options would have
vested in accordance with their terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Unvested Company Option
remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through each
such vesting date (provided, that any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of
the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger shall continue to apply to the Unvested
Option Consideration).Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 1.8(a), no holder of a Company Option that has
an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any
payment with respect to such canceled Company Option before or after the Effective Time.
(b) Each restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to any of the Company Equity Plans or otherwise (each,
an “RSU” and together, the “RSUs”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be treated as set forth in this Section 1.8(b). Each Vested RSU and each Director RSU
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to (i) the total number of
Shares issuable in settlement to such Vested RSU or Director RSU, as the case may be, immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, which amount (less applicable withholding Taxes)
shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.8(c) (the “RSU Consideration”). Each RSU that is not a Director RSU
or Vested RSU (an “Unvested RSU”) shall be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the RSU Consideration the holder of an Unvested RSU would have received had the
Unvested RSU been a Director RSU or Vested RSU (the “Unvested RSU Consideration”), provided that the
payment of the Unvested RSU Consideration shall be made at the same time(s) (and consistent with the
applicable payment method described in Section 1.8(c)) that the Unvested RSUs would have vested in
accordance with their terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Unvested RSUs remaining in continuous

Company Option or Vested RSU is not, and was not at any time during the vesting period of the Vested
Company Option or Vested RSU, an employee of the Company or any other Acquired Corporation for
employment tax purposes, the Vested Option Consideration or Vested RSU Consideration payable pursuant to

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and no later than 30 calendar days) following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the “Proxy Statement”) to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating
to the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders (such special meeting and any adjournments or
postponements thereof, the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) to be held to consider, among other matters,
the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) set a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of
the Exchange Act in connection therewith consistent with the timing to hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as described in this Section 5.2. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement, and each of the
Company and Parent covenants that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company
Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any (written or oral) comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any (written or oral) comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide Parent with a copy of all material written correspondence between the Company or any Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand (and a summary of any oral
conversations) with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and
supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC and disseminating such documents to the
Company Stockholders and reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for
additional information and shall give due consideration, in good faith, to including any comments on each such
document or response that are reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements, disseminated to the Company Stockholders; provided, that the delivery of such notice and
the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any Party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.
(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than ten (10) calendar
days, after the date on which the Company is informed that the SEC has cleared the Proxy Statement (or, if the
SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before the tenth (10th)
calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement pursuant to
A-31TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practical following such 10th calendar day), (i) mail or cause
to be mailed a letter to the holders of Shares, notice of the Company Stockholders Meeting and form of proxy
accompanying the Proxy Statement that will be provided to the holders of Shares in connection with the
solicitation of proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) take all other action necessary
under all applicable Legal Requirements, the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws and the rules of the Nasdaq to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy
Statement mailing to stockholders is complete and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the
date of such completed mailing (or if the Company’s nationally recognized proxy solicitor advises that thirty (30)
days from the date of mailing the Proxy Statement is insufficient time to submit and obtain the Company
Required Vote, such later date to which Parent consents (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld)). The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, (A) if (1) on a date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to
constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, or (2) prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Legal Requirements is provided to the Company Stockholders
within the minimum amount of time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting required by applicable Legal
Requirement, the Company shall, after consultation with Parent, have the right to and (B) upon the written
direction of Parent, if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to
constitute a quorum or the Company has not received sufficient affirmative approvals from the Company
Stockholders to obtain the Company Required Vote at the then-scheduled date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall, in either case, make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting; provided, that no (1) postponement or
adjournment shall be permitted if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (2) if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the
Company Stockholders Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by the above clause (B) for a period of
up to ten business days in the aggregate (provided, that Parent shall only make up to two such requests, each
for up to ten business days, and no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a
change to the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting). The Company shall, unless there has been a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.1(b), use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Required Vote, and to take all other
actions necessary or advisable to secure the Company Required Vote. The Company shall, upon the request of
Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the Company to advise
Parent on a reasonable basis as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Company Required Vote and, during the last ten business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
shall provide Parent on each day a tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company
Stockholders Meeting.
(c) Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit
this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, unless the Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7 prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting.

have been directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation in the past (the “Indemnified Persons”) for their
acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation and

Schedule and in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made available by the Company to Parent
or Parent’s Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
such Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest
extent available under Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, and any claim made
pursuant to such rights within such six-year period shall continue to be subject to this Section 5.6(a) and the
rights provided under this Section 5.6(a) until disposition of such claim.
(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation (together with their successors and assigns, the “Indemnifying Parties”) shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer
or director of an Acquired Corporation in connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based
on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of an
Acquired Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the
Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such Indemnified
Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by
Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of
appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is
ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 5.6(b).
(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the existing policy of directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Corporations as of the date of this Agreement (an
accurate and complete copy of which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parent’s
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently
covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
their capacities as directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage,
deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
the Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker) purchase a six-year “tail” policy for the
existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such “tail policy” has been obtained, it shall be deemed
to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.6(c); provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of
300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Acquired Corporations with respect to such current
policy, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.
(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.6.
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution

that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this
Section 5.6 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time in such a manner as to adversely

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require the Parent to disclose any information if such
disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so long
as the Parent has reasonably cooperated with the Company to permit such inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable
Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement

requested to arrange, obtain, negotiate and/or close the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing,
including, (x) the Required Financial Information, and (y) such other information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries’ current and historical operations, assets and business activities and financial statements
and other financial reports and information, as may be reasonably requested by Parent to the extent that such
information is of the type and form customarily included in a bank information memoranda and is historically
prepared by the Company and its Subsidiaries and customary and reasonable assistance (but not preparation
of) in the preparation by Parent of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements (it being
understood that Parent shall be responsible for the preparation of any pro forma calculations, any post-Closing

conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and (viii) executing and delivering customary authorization
letters authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders with respect to the Debt Financing;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or the other operations of the Acquired Corporations; provided, further, none
of the Acquired Corporations shall be required to commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the
Closing (including the entry into any agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than
customary authorization letters). The Company and its Subsidiaries consent to the use of their logos in
connection with the Debt Financing and Preferred Equity Financing so long as such logos are used solely in a
manner that is customary for such purpose and not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the

(c) No Acquired Corporation shall be required (other than in respect of customary authorization letters) to (i)
take any action that would subject it to liability, (ii) bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or (iii) provide or agree to provide
any indemnity in connection with the Financing, in each case for which it has not received prior reimbursement

Representative; (B) the Company Board to approve the Financing or Contracts related thereto; (C) the Company
and its Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate its organizational documents, any
applicable Legal Requirements; or (D) the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide any information (1) the
disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable Legal Requirements; or (2) where access to such
information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other privilege applicable to such information. The Company will be deemed to be in compliance with Section
5.8(b) at all times unless and until (i) Parent provides written notice (the “Non-Cooperation Notice”) to the
Company of any alleged failure to comply, or action or failure to act which could be believed to be a breach of
Section 5.8(b); (ii) Parent includes in such Non-Cooperation Notice reasonable detail regarding the cooperation
required to
A-38

cure such alleged failure (which will not require the Company to provide any cooperation that it would not
otherwise be required to provide under Section 5.8(b)); and (iii) the Company fails to take the actions specified
in such Non-Cooperation Notice within three business days from receipt of such Non-Cooperation Notice.
(d) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Corporations and their respective Representatives
from and against, and shall pay and reimburse the Acquired Corporations and their respective Representatives
for, any and all losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 5.8(d)) and any
information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent such losses result from (i) the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such indemnified Persons, (ii) any material inaccuracy of any financial information
provided by or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations in writing or (iii) the Company’s Willful Breach of its
obligations under this Section 5.8). Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company (and, within 10
business days of the Closing Date or, in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, within
10 business days following the Termination Date), reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable
out-of-pocket costs (in the case of legal costs, limited to one outside counsel) incurred by the Acquired
Corporations in connection with the cooperation of the Acquired Corporations contemplated by Section 5.8(a)
(other than the preparation of its normal quarterly and annual financial statements). Any such request submitted
by the Company or its Representatives hereunder this Section 5.8(d) or otherwise, shall be delivered promptly to
Parent following the incurrence of such costs as a condition precedent to the Reimbursement Obligation being a
valid and binding obligation on Parent. Parent’s obligations pursuant to this Section 5.8(d) referred to
collectively as the “Reimbursement Obligations.”
(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any flex provisions in the Debt Fee Letter) contemplated in the applicable Financing Letter
and such amount is required to fund the Required Amounts (taking into account any then available debt and
equity financing), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event,
obtain such Financing or such portion of the Financing from the same or alternative sources and in an amount at
least equal to the applicable Financing or such unavailable and required portion thereof, as the case may be
(taking into account any then available debt and equity financing) (which alternate financing may be debt
financing, preferred equity financing or a combination thereof as determined by Parent, the “Alternate
Financing”). Parent will promptly provide a copy of any commitment letter with respect to any Alternate
Financing (and any fee letter in connection therewith) to the Company (it being understood and agreed that any
such fee letter may be redacted in the same manner as the Debt Fee Letter). Any reference in this Agreement
(other than Section 3.7) to (i) the “Financing Letters”, the “Debt Commitment Letter” or the “Debt Fee Letter” (or
the “Preferred Equity Commitment Letter,” if applicable) will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to
the extent then in effect and any debt commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing (or the Preferred
Equity Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect and any preferred equity commitment letter in respect of
any Alternate Financing, if applicable), (ii) the “Financing Letters”, the “Debt Commitment Letter”, the
“Preferred Equity Commitment Letter” and the “Debt Fee Letter” shall refer to such documents as otherwise
amended, supplemented, modified or replaced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) the
“Financing” means the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended, supplemented, modified or
replaced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best
efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source
other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment
Letter, (ii) pay any fees or any interest rates, in each case that are non-de minimis, applicable to the Debt
Financing in excess in the aggregate of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the
“market flex” provisions), or agree to any non-de minimis “market flex” term that is less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent or Company than such corresponding “market flex” term contained in or contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions
contained therein or otherwise) or (iii) pay any fees or any
A-39

dividend rates, in each case that are not de minimis, applicable to the Preferred Equity Financing in excess in the
aggregate of those contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise).
(f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (and other than (x) expressly set forth in this Section
5.8 with respect to any Alternate Financing, (y) amendments, modifications or supplements to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and (z)
amendments contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof), each of Parent and
Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (in each case, except as expressly
permitted therein) to an amount less than the Required Amount; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or
other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the
timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to
occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto (including any right to seek or obtain specific performance of the Financing Letters).
(g) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative
financing (including the Alternate Financing), is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 6 and
satisfaction of the Marketing Period. If the Financing or any alternative financing (including any Alternate
Financing) has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 and the other terms of this Agreement (including
Section 8.5(c)), to consummate the Merger.",153,156

issued a decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or making consummation of the Transactions illegal, which order,
decree, ruling or other action shall be final and nonappealable; provided, however, that a Party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if the issuance of such final and

not be available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a
proximate cause of, or directly resulted in, the failure of the Transactions, including the Merger, to be
consummated by the Termination Date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement, except that Parent’s and Merger Sub’s failure to close solely as a result of the unavailability of the
Financing to be funded at the Closing which failure shall not have resulted from a breach by Parent or Merger
Sub of this Agreement, shall not limit Parent’s termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(c);

Company Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) at which a vote is taken on the

party), or otherwise made known to the Company Board or Company management, and (C) within twelve
months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a definitive agreement in respect

been disclosed) unless the definitive agreement or the Acquisition Proposal described in clause (C) is with
the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B) or an Affiliate of such Person or a

(c) Parent Payment. If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(i) or (ii)
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at a time when the Company would be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(i), then Parent must promptly (and in any event within two business days) following such
termination pay to the Company $320,000,000 in cash (the “Parent Termination Fee”).
(d) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or Parent, as
applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and upon the occurrence of different events.
(e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an
integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if either Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain
such payment, the payee Party commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a final non-appealable judgment
against the payor Party for the amount set forth in Section 7.3 or any portion thereof, the payor Party will pay to
the payee Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the payee Party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through
the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements (collectively, the “Enforcement Expenses”). All payments under
this Section 7.3 shall be made by the payor Party to the payee Party by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing.
(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company’s receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 7.3(c) (including the Company’s right to enforce
the Limited Guarantee with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from the Guarantors) will
be the sole and exclusive recourse and remedies of the Company and the Company Related Parties against
the Parent Related Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Equity
Financing, the Debt Financing, the Preferred Equity Financing, the Merger, any agreement executed in
connection herewith or therewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of
this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any of the Transactions or any claims or actions
under applicable Legal Requirements arising out of or in connection with any breach, termination or failure
or any matter forming the basis thereof. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of the Parent
Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of (A) the Company and its Affiliates; and
(B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of
each of the Company and its Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Company
Related Parties”) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any matters forming the basis of such
termination (except that the Parties (and/or their respective Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to,
and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 7.3(f)(i) will not relieve (a) Parent, Merger
Sub or the Guarantors from any liability for breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement or (b) any Person for
liability under the Support Agreement to which such Person is party. In no event will any of the Company
Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting
on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery
or award in excess of the Parent Termination Fee in connection with the collection thereof against (x)
Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor; or (y) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent,

members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Guarantor (the Persons in clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”); provided
that, from and after the Effective Time, the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of the Financing
Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing, nor limit the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to
recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant
to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing. In no event will
Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor, any Parent Related Party or any other Person have any liability for
monetary damages to the Company or any Company Related Party other than the Parent Termination Fee,
from Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors (without duplication) to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement, or with respect to the Guarantors, to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to payment of (1) any Enforcement Expenses
from Parent, Merger Sub, or pursuant to the terms of the Limited Guarantee, the Guarantors, for any
Enforcement Expenses owed to the Company under the terms of this Agreement and incurred by the
Company in connection with the collection of the Parent Termination Fee and (2) the Reimbursement
Obligations (in each case, up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000.00 for all Enforcement Expenses and
Reimbursement Obligations) when due under the terms of this Agreement, so long as Parent receives
prompt (and no later than ten (10) business days) notice of the vesting of such right under this Agreement,
along with any documentation related thereto.
(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Parent’s receipt of the Company
Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 7.3(b), together with any Enforcement Expenses
incurred in connection with the collection thereof (up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000.00 (the
“Company Enforcement Cap”)), will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors and the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or any Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable Legal Requirements
arising out of or in connection with any breach, termination or failure of any matter forming the basis
thereof. Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties will have
any further liability or obligation to any of Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantors or the Parent Related Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
Transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any matters forming the basis of such termination
(except that the Parties (and/or their respective Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the
Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement). In no event will any of
the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other
Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any
monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Termination Fee, except as provided by this Section
7.3(f)(ii), against any Company Related Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.3(f)(ii) will not
relieve (A) the Company from any liability (I) for any Willful Breach of this Agreement or (II) for any
breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement or (B) or any Person from liability under the Support Agreement
to which such Person is a party.
(iii) Each of the Parties acknowledges that any amount payable by the Company or Parent pursuant to
this Section 7.3, including the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, does not
constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement in the circumstances in which
such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.
(g) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
7.3(f), it is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 8.5(b), except that, although the Company, in its sole
discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing

terms, conditions and other limitations set forth herein), and (i) all claims or causes of action that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the Persons that are expressly identified as the Parties hereto, (ii) except as provided
in any Support Agreement, no past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member
general partner, limited partner, equityholder, trustee, Affiliate, agent attorney or other Representative of any
party thereto (including any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party thereto) shall
have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction documents or
with respect to any claim or cause of action that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction documents, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and (iii) in no event will
the Company seek or obtain, nor will it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person
be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Related Party
(including any Non-Recourse Parent Party as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter) with respect to this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee or the Transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including any breach by the Equity Financing Parties, the Guarantors, Parent or Merger Sub), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Transactions or any claims or actions under
applicable Legal Requirements arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, in each case, except for
claims that the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, may assert (subject, with respect to the following
clauses (B) and (C), in all respects to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(a), Section 7.3(f), Section 8.5(c) and
this Section 7.3(h)): (A) against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and conditions of,

Exhibit C-1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
other business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL, (iii) if the stockholder, or the

Solicitation Notice (as defined in this Section 5(b)), such stockholder or beneficial owner must, in the case of a
proposal, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the
corporation’s voting shares required under applicable law to carry any such proposal, or, in the case of a
nomination or nominations, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a percentage of the
corporation’s voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or beneficial owner to be sufficient to

the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day
nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of
the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is

preceding year’s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the
close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the
public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a
stockholder’s notice as described above. Such stockholder’s notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom
the stockholder proposed to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such
person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest,
or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “1934 Act”) and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person’s written consent to being named
in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the
stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such
business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as
to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation’s books, and
of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and
of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (iii) whether either such stockholder or beneficial
owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of the proposal, at least
the percentage of the corporation’s voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the
case of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number of holders of the corporation’s voting shares to elect
such nominee or nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a “Solicitation Notice”).
(c) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 5(b) of these Bylaws to the contrary, in the
event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and
there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased
Board of Directors made by the corporation at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year’s annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice required by this Section 5 shall also be considered
timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered
to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the
tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
(d) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5 shall
be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall
have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
Exhibit C-2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
made, or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any
proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defective
proposal or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in order to include information with respect to
a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholders’ meeting, stockholders must
provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be
deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation proxy statement
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.
(f) For purposes of this Section 5, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by
the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
1934 Act.
Section 6. Special Meetings.
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i)
the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer, or (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to
a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any
vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of
Directors for adoption), and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors
shall fix.
(b) If a special meeting is properly called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the
request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be
delivered personally or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by telegraphic or other
facsimile transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary of
the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice.
The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less

Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to
be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws.
Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a
meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.
Section 7. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice, given in writing or by electronic
transmission, of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days
before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place,
if any, date and hour, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at any such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
directed to the stockholder at such stockholder’s address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Notice of
the time, place, if any, and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person
entitled to notice thereof or by electronic transmission by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will
be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by
proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder
so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due
notice thereof had been given. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, §§ 222, 229, 232)
Section 8. Quorum. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be
adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The
Exhibit C-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Except as otherwise provided by statute, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other
than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on
the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person,
by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled to vote
generally on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, except where
otherwise provided by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the
outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on
that matter. Except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the
affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors) of shares of such class or classes or
series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the
act of such class or classes or series. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 216)
Section 9. Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or
special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the
shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy. When a meeting is
adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if
any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the
corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (Del.
Code Ann., tit. 8, § 222(c))
Section 10. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock
records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at
any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in
person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in
accordance with Delaware law. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three
(3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, §§ 211(e),
212(b))
Section 11. Joint Owners of Stock. If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names
of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants
by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same
shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or
order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall
have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the
majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each
faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief
as provided in the DGCL, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is
held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in
interest. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 217(b))
Section 12. List of Stockholders. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting
of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the
notice of the meeting, or during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the
event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an
Exhibit C-4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the corporation. The list shall be open to examination of any stockholder during the time of the
meeting as provided by law. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 219)
Section 13. Action Without Meeting.
(a) Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required by statute to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent in writing, or by electronic transmission setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders
of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. (Del. Code
Ann., tit. 8, § 228)
(b) Every written consent or electronic transmission shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who
signs the consent, and no written consent or electronic transmission shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation
in the manner herein required, written consents or electronic transmissions signed by a sufficient number of
stockholders to take action are delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of
Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in
which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation’s registered office
shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 228)
(c) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing or by electronic transmission
and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the
record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of
stockholders to take action were delivered to the corporation as provided in Section 228(c) of the DGCL. If the
action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the
DGCL if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under
such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders,
that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.
(d) An electronic mail, facsimile or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and
transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of
this Section, provided that any such electronic mail, facsimile or other electronic transmission sets forth or is
delivered with information from which the corporation can determine (i) that the electronic mail, facsimile or other
electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized
to act for the stockholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or
persons transmitted such electronic mail, facsimile or electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic
mail, facsimile or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent
was signed. No consent given by electronic mail, facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to
have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered
to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the state of Delaware, its principal place of business or
an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation’s registered office shall be made by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery,
consents given by electronic mail, facsimile or other electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the
principal place of business of the corporation or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the
book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided
by resolution of the board of directors of the corporation. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a
consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which
the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing.

the committee, a majority of the authorized number of members of any such committee shall constitute a quorum

SHARES OF STOCK
Section 34. Form and Execution of Certificates. The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates,

two authorized officers, including but not limited to the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial
Officer, any Vice President, the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, certifying the

issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of
issue. Each certificate shall state upon the face or back thereof, in full or in summary, all of the powers, designations,
preferences, and rights, and the limitations or restrictions of the shares authorized to be issued or shall, except as
otherwise required by law, set forth on the face or back a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to
each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other
special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such
preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the
corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set
forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section or otherwise required by law or with respect to this section a
statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers,
designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series
thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, §

certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. The corporation
may require, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the owner of such lost,
stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owner’s legal representative, to agree to indemnify the
corporation in such manner as it shall require or to give the corporation a surety bond in such form and amount as it
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 167)

Securities”)) may sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Covered Securities or
any right or interest therein, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, or by gift or otherwise (each, a
“Transfer”) without the prior written consent of the corporation, upon duly authorized action of the
Exhibit C-11
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board of Directors. The corporation may withhold consent for any legitimate corporate purpose, as determined
by the Board of Directors. Examples of the basis for the corporation to withhold its consent include, without
limitation, (i) if such Transfer to individuals, companies or any other form of entity identified by the corporation
as a potential competitor or considered by the corporation to be unfriendly; (ii) if such Transfer increases the
risk of the corporation having a class of security held of record by such number of persons as will require the
corporation to register such class of securities pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act, and Rule 12g5-1
promulgated thereunder, or otherwise requiring the corporation to register any class of securities under the 1934
Act; (iii) if such Transfer would result in the loss of any federal or state securities law exemption relied upon by
the corporation in connection with the initial issuance of such shares or the issuance of any other securities;
(iv) if such Transfer is facilitated in any manner by any public posting, message board, trading portal, internet
site, or similar method of communication, including without limitation any trading portal or internet site intended
to facilitate secondary transfers of securities; (v) if such Transfer is to be effected in a brokered transaction; or
(vi) if such Transfer represents a Transfer of less than all of the shares or Convertible Securities then held by the
holder and its affiliates or is to be made to more than a single transferee.
(b) If a holder desires to Transfer any Covered Securities, then the holder shall first give written notice thereof
to the corporation. The notice shall name the proposed transferee and state the number of shares, including
shares issuable upon exercise of Convertible Securities, to be transferred, the proposed consideration, and all
other terms and conditions of the proposed transfer. Any Covered Securities proposed to be transferred to
which Transfer the corporation has consented pursuant to Section 36(a) will first be subject to the corporation’s
right of first refusal located in Section 46 hereof.
(c) Any Transfer, or purported Transfer, of Covered Securities not made in strict compliance with this Section
36 shall be null and void, shall not be recorded on the books of the corporation and shall not be recognized by
the corporation.
(d) The foregoing restriction on Transfer shall terminate upon the date securities of the corporation are first
offered to the public pursuant to a registration statement filed with, and declared effective by, the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
(e) The certificates or other documents representing Covered Securities of the corporation shall bear on their
face the following legend so long as the foregoing Transfer restrictions are in effect:
“THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A TRANSFER RESTRICTION, AS
PROVIDED IN THE BYLAWS OF THE CORPORATION.”
Section 37. Fixing Record Dates.
(a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting
of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall, subject to applicable law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten
(10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall
not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate
action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record
date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a
request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record
Exhibit C-12

date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a
request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings
of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation’s registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(c) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend
or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to
such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 213)
Section 38. Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person
registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be
bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature
of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer;
provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the
manual signature, or where permissible facsimile signature, of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such

authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation
or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile

corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such interest coupon, shall have
ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have
been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation

Section 43. Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Third Party Proceedings.
(a) Directors and Officers. Subject to the other provisions of this Article XI, the corporation shall indemnify,
to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) (other than an action by or in the right of the
corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director of the corporation or an officer of the
corporation, or while a director of the corporation or officer of the corporation is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the
person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable
cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful.
(b) Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation. Subject to the
other provisions of this Article XI, the corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,
as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or while a director
or officer of the corporation is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement
of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
Exhibit C-14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall
deem proper.
(c) Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 43(a) or
Section 43(b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
(d) Indemnification of Others. Subject to the other provisions of this Article XI, the corporation shall have
power to indemnify its employees and its agents to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable
law. The board of directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether employees or agents
shall be indemnified to such person or persons as the board of determines.
(e) Advancement of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director of the
corporation in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of
such Proceeding upon receipt of a written request therefor (together with documentation reasonably evidencing
such expenses) and an undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be
determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XI or the DGCL. Such expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so
paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems reasonably appropriate and shall be
subject to the corporation’s expense guidelines. The right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to any
claim for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these bylaws, but shall apply to any Proceeding referenced in
Section 43(f)(2) or 43(f)(3) prior to a determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation.
(f) Limitation on Indemnification. Subject to the requirements in Section 43(c) and the DGCL, the corporation
shall not be obligated to indemnify any person pursuant to this Article XI in connection with any Proceeding (or
any part of any Proceeding):
(1) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of such person under any statute,
insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the
amount paid;
(2) for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, or similar
provisions of federal, state or local statutory law or common law, if such person is held liable therefor

(3) for any reimbursement of the corporation by such person of any bonus or other incentive-based or
equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by such person from the sale of securities of the
corporation, as required in each case under the 1934 Act (including any such reimbursements that arise
from an accounting restatement of the corporation pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or the payment to the corporation of profits arising from the purchase
and sale by such person of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if such person
is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements);
(4) initiated by such person against the corporation or its directors, officers, employees, agents or other
indemnitees, unless (a) the board of directors authorized the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the
Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (b) the corporation provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under applicable law, (c) otherwise required to be made
under Section 43(g) or (d) otherwise required by applicable law; or
(5) if prohibited by applicable law; provided, however, that if any provision or provisions of this Article
XI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each portion
of any paragraph or clause containing any such provision held to be invalid,

from the provisions of this Section 46, the price shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the stock at such

transferring stockholder’s notice, said transferring stockholder may, subject to the corporation’s approval and
all other restrictions on Transfer located in Section 36 hereof, within the sixty-day period following the expiration
or waiver of the option rights granted to the corporation and/or its assignees(s) herein, Transfer the shares
specified in said transferring stockholder’s notice which were not acquired by the corporation and/or its
assignees(s) as specified in said transferring stockholder’s notice. All shares so sold by said transferring
stockholder shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this bylaw in the same manner as before said
Transfer.
(f) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the following transactions shall be exempt
from the right of first refusal in Section 46(a):
(1) A stockholder’s Transfer of any or all of such stockholder’s shares to the corporation; or

In any such case, the transferee, assignee, or other recipient shall receive and hold such stock subject to the
provisions of this Section 46 and the transfer restrictions in Section 36, and there shall be no further Transfer of
such stock except in accord with this bylaw and the transfer restrictions in Section 36.

be transferred by the transferring stockholder). This bylaw may be amended or repealed either by a duly
authorized action of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, upon the express written consent of the
owners of a majority of the voting power of the corporation.
