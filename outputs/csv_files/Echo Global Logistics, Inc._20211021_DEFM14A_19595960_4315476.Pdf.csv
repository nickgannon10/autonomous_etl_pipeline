On September 9, 2021, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) rendered its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Company’s Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion,
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written
opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company common
stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares (as defined below) or any of Buyer’s affiliates).
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley to the Company’s Board, dated as of September 9,
2021, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The
opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion.
Stockholders of the Company are urged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was directed to the Company’s Board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a
financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to
the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than the holders of the
Excluded Shares or any of Buyer’s affiliates). Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other
agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection
therewith and does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative
business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are
available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or recommendation as to how the
holders of shares of Company common stock should vote at any stockholders’ meeting to be held in
connection with the merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is

In considering the recommendation of the Company’s Board that Company stockholders vote to approve the
merger agreement, Company stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Echo
have potential interests in the proposed merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Company stockholders generally. The Company’s Board was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other matters, in making its recommendation that Company stockholders vote to approve the merger
agreement. These interests include:
The merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all Company restricted
stock awards, performance shares and restricted stock units.
Certain of the Company’s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation
and benefits under existing agreements between such officers and the Company.
The merger agreement provides for the payment of minimum annual bonuses to the Company’s
executive officers for calendar year 2021.

The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Buyer. It is anticipated that the total amount of
funds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid at the closing of the merger by Buyer and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be
approximately $1,418.5 million in cash. In connection with the financing of the merger, The Resolute Fund V,
L.P. (the “TJC Fund”) and Buyer have entered into an equity commitment letter, dated September 9, 2021 (the
“Equity Commitment Letter”), in respect of the Equity Commitment. The Equity Commitment is equal to
$758.1 million in cash (the “Equity Commitment”).
Buyer expects to finance the merger with debt financing, together with cash on hand (including proceeds
received pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter). In connection with entering into the merger agreement,
Buyer has entered into a second amended and restated commitment letter (the “Debt Commitment Letter”),
dated as of October 15, 2021, with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (“CS”), Credit Suisse Loan
Funding LLC (“CSLF”, and together with CS, “Credit Suisse”), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (together with

have committed to provide (i) a seven-year senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $550.0 million, (ii) an eight-year senior secured second lien term loan facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $160.0 million and (iii) a five-year senior secured first lien revolving credit
facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $100.0 million (collectively, the “credit facilities”), to fund a
portion of the consideration for the merger, refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company and
related transaction fees, costs and expenses (the “debt commitment”). The funding and availability of the

closing conditions, including (1) the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the
credit facilities in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (2)

Pursuant to the Limited Guaranty dated as of September 9, 2021 (the “Limited Guaranty”), delivered by the
TJC Fund in favor of the Company, the TJC Fund has agreed to guaranty the following payment obligations

certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub for certain costs, expenses
or losses incurred or sustained by the Company in connection with providing financing cooperation to
Buyer, as further specified in the merger agreement (the “Reimbursement Obligations”); and (iii) any amounts
in respect of certain out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to the Company’s

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Echo common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders will generally recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the adjusted tax basis of the shares
of Echo common stock surrendered. Echo stockholders who are U.S. Holders (as defined under “The Merger
(Proposal 1) - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) will generally be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the merger. Echo stockholders who are
Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain
recognized in connection with the merger unless the stockholder has certain connections to the United
States. The tax consequences of the merger to Echo stockholders will depend upon their particular
circumstances and Echo stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax
consequences of the merger to them, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or
foreign jurisdiction.",15,15

comply fully with all of the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this
proxy statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than

other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote on the adoption of the

subject to specified conditions described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - 
Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation - Receipt of Acquisition Proposals”;
contact a person making the acquisition proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof;
and
engage in or participate in discussions and/or negotiations with that person regarding the acquisition
proposal.",16,17

Echo’s Board has unanimously recommended that Echo stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve
the merger agreement. The merger agreement permits Echo’s Board to effect a “change of recommendation”  
(as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation - 
Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) only in certain limited
circumstances, as described below.
Before the requisite company vote is obtained, Echo’s Board may effect a change of recommendation and/or
terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, in each case if Echo’s Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that an
acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a change of recommendation or terminating
the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, (1) Echo must have given Buyer at least five (5)
business days’ prior written notice of its intention to do so, (2) Echo must have afforded Buyer the
opportunity to negotiate in good faith with Echo to enable Buyer to propose in writing a binding offer to
make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (3) at the end of the notice period, the Company’s
Board must have considered in good faith the binding written offer and any other information it deems
appropriate, and must have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that the superior proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal if the changes
proposed in the binding offer by Buyer were to be given effect.
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation - Change of Board
Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement - Termination.”
In addition, before the requisite company vote is obtained, Echo’s Board may effect a change of
recommendation in response to an intervening event if Echo’s Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a change of recommendation in response to an
intervening event, (1) Echo must have given Buyer at least five (5) days prior written notice of its intention
to do so, (2) Echo must have afforded Buyer the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with Echo to enable
Buyer to propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and (3) at
the end of the notice period, Echo’s Board must have considered in good faith the binding written offer and
any other information it deems appropriate, and must have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, that the failure to effect a change of
recommendation would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law if the changes
proposed in the binding offer by Buyer were to be given effect.
Under the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means a material development or material change in
circumstances with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries, occurring after the date of the merger
agreement and prior the receipt of the company requisite vote that (i) was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by the Company’s Board as of or prior to the date of the merger agreement (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or reasonably

any acquisition proposal, (B) the fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating
metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the merger agreement (provided that the exception in
this clause (B) shall not prevent or otherwise affect any such development or change underlying the
Company meeting or exceeding such metrics from being taken into account in determining whether an
intervening event has occurred), or (C) any changes after the date of the merger agreement in the market
price or trading volume of the Company common stock (provided that the exception in this clause (C) shall
not prevent or otherwise affect any such development or change underlying such change in market price or
trading value from being taken into account in determining whether an intervening event occurred);
provided, further, that an acquisition proposal that resulted from a breach of Echo’s non-solicitation
obligations under the merger agreement may not be the basis for an intervening event.

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the Special
Meeting and the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not
address all of the questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy
statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you
should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You
Can Find Additional Information.”
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On September 9, 2021, we entered into a merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a
direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The merger agreement provides for the Buyer to
acquire the Company in a merger for a price of $48.25 per share in cash, without interest. You are
receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company’s Board in
favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and to approve the other related proposals to be
voted on at the Special Meeting.
When and where is the Special Meeting?
The Special Meeting will be held virtually, on November 19, 2021, at 9:00 a.m. CT (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof). This Special Meeting will be a virtual meeting conducted solely
online. You will be able to attend the Special Meeting online by logging in at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECHO2021SM. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting
in person.
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
Only holders of record of the Company common stock as of the close of business on October 20, 2021,
the record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their
shares at the Special Meeting. Each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding as of the
close of business on the record date will be entitled to one (1) vote on each matter submitted to a vote
at the Special Meeting.
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
to approve the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer;
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become
payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and
to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger
agreement or in the absence of a quorum.
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
As the Special Meeting is being conducted via an audio webcast, there is no physical meeting location.
To attend the Special Meeting, log in at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECHO2021SM. You will
need your unique control number included on your proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied
your proxy materials. We recommend that you log in a few minutes before the meeting to ensure you are
logged in when the meeting starts. If you encounter any technical difficulties accessing the virtual
meeting, a toll-free number will be available to assist.
If your shares are held through a broker, trustee or other nominee, it is likely that they are registered in
the name of the nominee, and you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name. As the

beneficial owner of shares held for your account, you have the right to direct the registered holder to
vote your shares as you instruct. Your broker, trustee or other nominee has provided a voting
instruction card for you to use in directing how your shares are to be voted. As a beneficial owner, you
will need to obtain a “legal proxy” from our broker, trustee or other nominee to vote your shares online
during the virtual Special Meeting. If you lose your control number, you may join the Special Meeting
as a “Guest” or by dialing 1-877-328-2502 (toll free) or 1-412-317-5419 (International Dial in) and
referencing “Echo” but you will not be able to vote, ask questions or access the list of stockholders as
of the record date.
Why did we choose to hold a virtual Special Meeting?
Our Board decided to hold the Special Meeting virtually in response to public health concerns over
large gatherings of people in order to help limit potential transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, our
experience with virtual meetings demonstrated that the goals of accessibility and stockholder
participation can be well served by the virtual format.
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of
the Company issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting are present virtually or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the
shares present in person or presented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting, may
adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place.
As of the close of business on October 20, 2021, the record date for the Special Meeting, there were
26,630,895 shares of common stock outstanding.
If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on
the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present
at the Special Meeting.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the merger agreement?
Approval of the merger agreement requires the vote of a majority of the shares of common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the Special Meeting “FOR” the proposal to
approve the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from
voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. If
your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the
nominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted upon at the Special
Meeting?
Each of the advisory (non-binding) proposals to approve certain compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional
proxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of our common stock present, in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting.
An abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock
(including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. Because all proposals for the Special Meeting are
non-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes for such proposals.
How does the Company’s Board recommend that I vote?
Our Board unanimously recommends that Echo stockholders vote:
“FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement;
16 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
“FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of Echo in connection with the merger; and
“FOR” the proposal regarding adjournment of the Special Meeting.
For a discussion of the factors that the Company’s Board considered in determining to recommend the
approval of the merger agreement, please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of Echo’s Board.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of
our Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and
executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company
stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled “The Merger
(Proposal 1) - Interests of Echo’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
How do Echo’s directors and officers intend to vote?
We currently expect that Echo’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the
proposal to approve the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the Special
Meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.
When is the merger expected to be completed?
As of the date of the filing of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger during the second
half of calendar year 2021. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described in this proxy statement and include
regulatory clearances, and it is possible that the merger will not be completed until a later time, or at all.
There may be a substantial amount of time between the Special Meeting and the completion of the
merger. After the requisite vote is obtained, our Board will not have the right to terminate the merger
agreement in order to accept any alternative acquisition proposal. We expect to complete the merger
promptly after the requisite vote is obtained and all required regulatory clearances have been received.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger agreement is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the merger is not
completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Echo will remain a public company, and shares of
our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on
the Nasdaq. In the event that the Company fails to promptly pay the company termination fee or the
Buyer fails to promptly pay the buyer termination fee, and in order to obtain such payment, the Buyer,
on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a legal proceeding that results in a
judgment against the Company for the company termination fee, or any portion thereof, as applicable,
the Company shall pay the Buyer, or the Buyer shall pay the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorney’s fees) in connection with such legal proceeding
(including interests) (the amounts referred to in the foregoing, the “Collection Costs”); provided, that in
no event shall the Collection Costs exceed $10,000,000.
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?
We urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and
the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger
affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own.
Voting Virtually
Stockholders of record will be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of
record, but instead hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee, you must provide a “legal proxy” executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in
order to be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
It is not necessary to attend the Special Meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of
common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions
promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.
Attending the meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
You can also ensure that your shares are voted at the Special Meeting by submitting your proxy via:
mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope;
telephone, by viewing the proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com and using a touch-tone phone
and the toll-free number 1-800-690-6903; or
the Internet, at www.proxyvote.com and the 12-digit control number on the enclosed proxy card.
The telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. ET on
November 18, 2021.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a
proposal, your proxy will be voted “FOR”  (1) the proposal to approve the merger agreement, (2) the advisory
(non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s the named executive officers in connection with the merger, and (3) the proposal to approve on or
more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the
merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.
We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the Special Meeting.
A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve
the merger agreement and on the other two proposals (assuming, in the case of a failure to vote, that a
quorum is present).
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the
directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the
proposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in
connection with the merger or the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.
Can I revoke my proxy?
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying Echo at Echo Global Logistics, Inc., 600
West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725, Chicago, IL 60654, Attention: Zach Jecklin, or by submitting a new
proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke
your proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually; however, simply attending the
Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in
“street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should
instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior
voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by
voting virtually at the Special Meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker,
bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
The requisite number of shares to approve each of the proposal to approve the merger agreement is
based on the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date, not just the
shares that are voted. If you do not vote, or abstain from voting, on the proposal to approve the merger
agreement and the other two proposals, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” each such
proposal.
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
The inclusion of this proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”); however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger and
the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not be binding on Echo or Buyer.
If the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-
related compensation may be paid to our named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their
compensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Will my shares of common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for
voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
No. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a
different stockholder (that is, your custodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of
common stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in “street name” will not be
combined for voting purposes with shares of common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own
shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a
trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card
for those shares of common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares
of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the
entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of common
stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, you should read carefully
any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will
receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards
and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet)
to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.
What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?
In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through
completion of the merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of common stock before completion
of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger.
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the completion of
the merger. If you transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the closing of
the merger, you will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the merger
consideration.
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the
paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common
stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are
held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your
19

Q: 
A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your
“street name” shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your stock certificates now.
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares
of common stock?
Yes. As a holder of Echo common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL, in
connection with the merger if you take certain actions, meet certain conditions and fully comply with the
requirements set forth under the DGCL, including that you do not vote (virtually or by proxy) in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. These procedures are summarized in the section entitled “Appraisal
Rights of Echo Stockholders.” In addition, the text of the applicable appraisal rights provisions of
Delaware law is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to strictly comply
with these provisions will result in the loss of dissenters’ rights.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or
more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company
provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to
receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted
householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received householding notification

the occurrence of any event that could give rise to termination of the merger agreement;
risks related to the disruption of the transaction to the Company and its management;

of the merger or result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and risks
associated with other litigation relating to our business;

At the Special Meeting, Echo stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
to approve the merger agreement, dated as of September 9, 2021, by and among Buyer, Merger Sub
and Echo;
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is
disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) - 
Interests of Echo’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”; and
to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger
agreement or in the absence of a quorum.
Our stockholders must approve the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to
approve the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex A, and the material provisions of the merger agreement are described in the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from
the vote to approve the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the executive
compensation and vote not to approve the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on executive
compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Echo or Buyer.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders and the merger is completed, the
merger-related compensation may be paid to our executive officers even if the stockholders fail to approve
the proposal.
We do not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the Special Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have
discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.

For Echo to complete the merger, Echo stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you
provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods
described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with
instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or
via the Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of
common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and
returned your proxy card, as described below.
Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is
received in time for the Special Meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in the manner directed
by you on your proxy card.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be
voted in favor of each of the proposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal
to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of
Echo in connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special
Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If you fail
to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you attend the Special
Meeting and vote virtually, the effect will be that your shares of common stock will not be considered
present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special
Meeting, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement and,
assuming a quorum is present, will not affect the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Echo in connection
with the merger, or the vote regarding the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,”
your broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for
your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting
instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting
instruction form.
In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common
stock in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with
respect to the proposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve
certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Echo in
connection with the merger or the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including
to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees
do not receive specific voting instructions with respect to these proposals from the beneficial owner of such
shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the
Special Meeting virtually with a properly executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your
failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of Echo
common stock not being voted on any of the proposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-
binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Echo in connection with the merger or the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting,

Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time
before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote
is taken at the Special Meeting by:
submitting a new proxy dated after the date of the proxy being revoked, by using the telephone or
Internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and
returning a new proxy card by mail to Echo, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card;
attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually; or
delivering a written notice of revocation dated after the date of the proxy being revoked by mail to
Echo at Echo Global Logistics, Inc., 600 West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725, Chicago, IL 60654,
Attention: Zach Jecklin, in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without
taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to
revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to Echo or by sending a written notice of revocation to Echo,
you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it
to be received by Echo before the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the
instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit
new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by
voting virtually at the Special Meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or
other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting.",29,31

"Echo Global Logistics, Inc._20211021_DEFM14A_19595960_4315476.Pdf",Background to the Merger,"Background to the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key events that led to the signing of the merger agreement and
does not purport to catalogue every conversation, nor the details of every conversation, involving the
Board, management or other representatives of the Company and other parties. Other than as described
below and for contacts in the ordinary course of our business, there have been no material contacts between
Echo and TJC in the two years preceding the signing of the merger agreement and TJC was not involved in
the 2016 Process or the 2019 Process (each as defined and discussed further below).
The Board and Echo’s management regularly evaluate and consider Echo’s historical performance, future
growth prospects, overall strategic goals and objectives and various opportunities to enhance stockholder
value, as well as industry conditions and development. As part of this ongoing evaluation process, Echo
from time to time evaluates potential transactions that would further its strategic objectives.
The Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These potential strategic
alternatives have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, Echo’s
current business plan, with Echo remaining an independent entity; (2) the investment in, and development
of, new business lines and services; (3) capital raising activities; (4) potential expansion opportunities
through acquisitions, partnership or other commercial relationships; and (5) business combinations,
acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of Echo. While the Board
regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening our
business and enhancing stockholder value, Echo’s receipt of unsolicited indications of interest in
transactions involving the potential sale of the Company have resulted in Echo’s focused exploration of a
potential sale through two processes in recent years (neither of which identified any actionable offers, as
described in further detail below).
27 TABLE OF CONTENTS
In August of 2016, Echo received an unsolicited inquiry from a strategic party inquiring about Echo’s interest
in a sale of Echo. Thereafter, Morgan Stanley was retained by Echo to serve as the financial advisor to Echo.
At the time of its engagement, Morgan Stanley was well known to Echo and Echo management in light of
past work performed on behalf of Echo and Morgan Stanley’s experience in transactions similar to the one
proposed, qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the Company and its business and
the industries in which the Company conducts its business. Under the direction of the Board, 21 strategic
parties and 11 financial parties were contacted in September of 2016 in order to explore a potential
transaction (the “2016 Process”). Overall, 14 parties signed non-disclosure agreements and 12 parties
(including the strategic party whose unsolicited inquiry led to the 2016 Process) received management
presentations during the fall of 2016. Ultimately, no party submitted an indication of interest and the process
was terminated in early 2017.
During June and July 2019, Echo received written, unsolicited and non-binding indications of interest from
three financial sponsors, including a portfolio company of one such sponsor, offering to purchase the
Company at prices ranging from $22.50 to $25.00 per share. The letters containing such indications of interest
were addressed to Mr. Waggoner and Mr. Waggoner, in turn, promptly shared such letters with the Board.
In July 2019, at the direction of the Board and in response to these indications of interest, Echo engaged
Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor and initiated a process to consider strategic alternatives, including a
potential sale of the Company (the “2019 Process”). At the time of its engagement in connection with the
2019 Process, Morgan Stanley was well known to Echo and Echo management due to, among other things,
Morgan Stanley’s familiarity with Echo resulting from its engagement in connection with the 2016 Process
and the other factors enumerated previously. In connection with the 2019 Process, at the direction of the
Board, Morgan Stanley gauged the interest of a number of financial sponsors and strategic parties, including
one such party that subsequently re-emerged in 2021 as a bidder to acquire Echo (which party we refer to as
“Strategic A”).
In connection with the 2019 Process, Echo received nine non-binding indications of interest, of which three
were from strategic parties, including Strategic A, and six were from financial sponsors. The indications of
interest contemplated prices per share ranging from $24.00 to $28.64. Eight parties, including all three
strategic parties and five financial sponsors, were invited to participate in due diligence and asked to submit
updated proposals. None of those parties submitted a final proposal and all such parties withdrew from the
process. In late 2019, Echo formally concluded the process and terminated its engagement of Morgan
Stanley.
In early 2020, the Board directed that management provide an assessment of the Company’s competitive
position within the logistics industry and develop strategic initiatives to enhance such position. As part of
conducting this assessment, the Board, together with management, focused on organic operational
enhancements to our business plan that would be most likely to enhance stockholder value. As a result of
this process, Echo adopted the strategic objectives to (i) gain market share, (ii) grow EBITDA more than net
revenue, (iii) provide industry leading service to shippers and carriers and (iv) create enhanced profitability
through technology and automation. Thereafter, Echo commenced various operating initiatives designed to
promote these strategic objectives, including further digitizing and automating the pricing, sourcing, load
management and tracking systems on Echo’s platform, driving growth of its brokerage business through
improved sourcing, competitive pricing, client acquisitions and restructured employee incentives, integrating
technology and business processes to improve speed to market and functionality of its internal and external
technology releases and expanding its managed transportation business through improved product offerings
and service.
Implementing these operating initiatives, navigating the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic,
including the shift to remote work for substantially all of its employees, and seeking to capitalize on
favorable freight market opportunities and dynamics that began to emerge in the second quarter of 2020 and
continued in 2021, the Company produced record operating results in 2020 and during the quarter ended
March 31, 2021, and raised its full year guidance in a press release dated April 28, 2021, announcing first
quarter results for 2021.
On June 15, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a call from Renee Krug, an operating partner of TJC. TJC did not
participate in the 2016 Process or the 2019 Process. Ms. Krug asked if Mr. Waggoner would be open
28 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to a conversation to discuss a potential transaction between TJC and Echo. Mr. Waggoner agreed to a call,
which was set for June 17, 2021.
Also on June 15, 2021, Mr. Waggoner contacted Echo’s outside counsel, Winston & Strawn LLP
(“Winston”), and Mr. Skinner, lead independent director of the Board, to discuss the outreach received from
TJC. Mr. Waggoner was instructed to inform TJC that, if it wished to pursue a potential transaction with the
Company, it should submit a letter to the Board expressing such interest. Mr. Waggoner also agreed to
provide an update to both Winston and Mr. Skinner following the June 17, 2021 call with TJC.
On June 17, 2021, Mr. Waggoner participated in a call with Brian Higgins, Peter Suffredini and Renee Krug of
TJC. Mr. Higgins asked Mr. Waggoner if Echo would be open to discussing a “take-private” transaction and
solicited Mr. Waggoner’s opinion on the most appropriate next steps in order to proceed with such a
transaction. Mr. Waggoner responded that the first step would be for TJC to submit a letter to the Board
confirming TJC’s interest in Echo. Mr. Waggoner added that as Echo is a reporting company, TJC should
have access to sufficient publicly available information to enable it to develop an informed view on valuation
and that such view should be included in TJC’s letter to the Board. Finally, Mr. Waggoner indicated that if
the Board found TJC’s letter compelling, the parties could enter into a non-disclosure agreement and,
thereafter, engage in further discussions. Following the call, Mr. Waggoner provided a summary of the
discussion with TJC to Winston and Mr. Skinner.
On June 24, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a letter from TJC (the “TJC Indication of Interest”) addressed to
the Board reflecting TJC’s non-binding interest in acquiring all of the outstanding capital stock of Echo for
cash consideration of $40.00 per share, which reflected a 26.8% premium to the closing price of $31.55 on
June 23, 2021 and a 9.4% premium to the then all-time high closing share price of $36.56 on May 5, 2021. The
TJC Indication of Interest did not request that Echo enter into exclusivity with TJC. Mr. Waggoner forwarded
a copy of the TJC Indication of Interest to the Board and scheduled a special meeting of the Board for the
next day, June 25, 2021, to consider the TJC Indication of Interest.
On June 25, 2021, the Board met and discussed both the TJC Indication of Interest and the major strategic
alternatives available to Echo, including the continuation of Echo’s business plan with Echo remaining an
independent company. Following this discussion, the Board concluded that the transaction contemplated by
the TJC Indication of Interest warranted further consideration. The Board also discussed the need to engage
a financial advisor to assist in such consideration and directed management to explore a potential
engagement of Morgan Stanley due to, among other things, Morgan Stanley’s familiarity with Echo resulting
from its engagement in connection with the 2016 Process and the 2019 Process. The Board also directed
management to update its five-year plan to assist the Board in assessing the proposal from TJC and other
potential strategic alternatives.
Promptly following the meeting of the Board, Mr. Waggoner and Winston contacted Morgan Stanley to
discuss, subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between the parties, the potential engagement of
Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor in connection with the exploration of a potential strategic transaction
with TJC or other interested parties.
On June 30, 2021, Morgan Stanley sent a draft engagement letter to Winston and discussions ensued with
Morgan Stanley, Winston, and Echo on the terms of Morgan Stanley’s potential engagement. Morgan
Stanley also met with management of Echo to discuss a potential process and the management plan being
prepared for the Board.
On July 1, 2021, Mr. Waggoner sent an email to TJC confirming that the Board was considering its proposal
and would provide a further update following that consideration.
On July 6, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a text message from the president and chief executive officer of
Strategic A (such officer of Strategic A, “CEO A”). In this text message, CEO A indicated he would be in
Chicago, Illinois on July 19, 2021, and invited Mr. Waggoner to dinner. Mr. Waggoner accepted the invitation
and promptly advised Winston, Morgan Stanley, and Mr. Skinner of this contact.
On July 8, 2021, Mr. Waggoner participated in a call with Mr. Higgins and told him that Echo had held a
Board meeting and had begun the process of engaging a financial advisor.
29 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 14, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was convened with Morgan Stanley and Winston in
attendance. Mr. Waggoner updated the Board on the contact from CEO A and the planned dinner on July 19,
2021. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided certain financial analysis and discussed the TJC
Indication of Interest. As part of this discussion, the Morgan Stanley representatives provided certain
background information on TJC, including TJC’s experience in the freight and logistics industry, and noted
that Strategic A might be interested in an acquisition of Echo. The Board discussed next steps and
concluded that enlarging the process by approaching other potential buyers risked jeopardizing the serious
and credible interest demonstrated by TJC and the potential that Strategic A would also emerge as a serious
and credible bidder in the process. The Board also reviewed the preliminary management plan presented by
Echo’s management and directed management to update the plan to reflect opportunities presented by
evolving market conditions and the impact of planned operating and technology initiatives. Winston then
provided an overview of the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with the consideration of a potential
strategic transaction. Winston also reviewed guidelines that had been utilized previously in the 2016 Process
and the 2019 Process, which directed that management, including Mr. Waggoner, not engage in discussions
with any bidder concerning post-closing compensation or equity arrangements until expressly permitted by
the Board. Finally, the Board reviewed the proposed terms of the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley and
approved the retention of Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor pursuant to such terms. Following the
meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted TJC to inform them that the Board had determined to
provide TJC with access to non-public business and financial information in order to allow TJC to improve
upon its proposal. During that call, the Morgan Stanley representatives also discussed the transaction
process, including the negotiation and execution of a non-disclosure agreement, a request that TJC develop
a list of diligence issues key to improving its valuation of Echo and the expectation that the financial model
included in Echo’s management plan would be made available after TJC’s execution of a non-disclosure
agreement. The Morgan Stanley representatives then briefed Mr. Waggoner on Morgan Stanley’s discussion
with TJC and Mr. Waggoner, in turn, sent an email to the members of the Board summarizing the update
provided by Morgan Stanley and outlining next steps with respect to the consideration of a potential
transaction.
On July 15, 2021, Winston, through Morgan Stanley, sent a Form of Non-Disclosure Agreement to TJC. The
parties exchanged drafts of such agreement and a non-disclosure agreement between the Company and TJC
was signed on July 22, 2021.
On July 19, 2021, Mr. Waggoner had dinner with CEO A in Chicago, Illinois. During the course of that dinner,
CEO A indicated that Strategic A was interested in pursuing strategic transactions with complementary
businesses and that Echo was a potential acquisition target. Mr. Waggoner and CEO A also discussed
Strategic A’s involvement in the 2019 Process. Although no details of a potential transaction between Echo
and Strategic A were discussed at this dinner, Mr. Waggoner did indicate to CEO A that if Strategic A was, in
fact, interested in pursuing a transaction with Echo it would be advisable for Strategic A to act promptly.
On July 20, 2021, Mr. Waggoner provided an update to each of Mr. Skinner and Winston on his dinner and
discussion with CEO A.
A special meeting of Echo’s Board was held on July 23, 2021, at which representatives of Morgan Stanley
and Winston were in attendance. At this meeting, Mr. Waggoner updated the full board on his dinner and
discussion with CEO A. The Board also reviewed and approved an updated management plan, including the
five-year model contemplated thereby.
TJC and its counsel were provided with the approved management plan on July 23, 2021 and access to the
virtual data room containing business and legal diligence materials on July 27, 2021.
A regular meeting of the Board was held on July 30, 2021. At this meeting, Mr. Waggoner provided an update
on the strategic process, noting that TJC had commenced its diligence and that an in-person management
and technology presentations with TJC were scheduled for August 5, 2021 and August 10, 2021,
respectively. Mr. Waggoner also noted that he had not had further contact with CEO A.
On the evening of August 4, 2021, representatives of TJC, Morgan Stanley and Echo had dinner together in
Chicago, Illinois. On August 5, 2021, representatives of TJC, Echo, and Morgan Stanley
30 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
attended an in-person management presentation at Echo’s offices in Chicago, Illinois with representatives of
TJC’s financial advisor participating virtually.
On August 9, 2021, representatives of TJC, Echo and Morgan Stanley participated in a call to discuss Echo’s
financial model.
On August 10, 2021, representatives of TJC, Echo and Morgan Stanley attended a virtual presentation on
Echo’s technology.
Following the technology presentation, representatives of Morgan Stanley asked that TJC provide an
updated perspective on value and confirm its interest in pursuing a transaction. On August 12, 2021, TJC
confirmed it remained interested in pursuing a transaction at a price of $40.00 per share. TJC further indicated
it would not unilaterally propose an increase to such price but would respond to a counter proposal from
Echo.
On August 11, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a telephone call from CEO A. During that call, CEO A indicated
that Strategic A would like to make an offer to buy Echo and asked Mr. Waggoner for his views on the
appropriate steps to proceed with such an offer. Mr. Waggoner told CEO A that Strategic A would need to
submit a letter to the Board indicating Strategic A’s interest with specific detail on valuation and an expected
timeline for the proposed transaction.
On August 12, 2021, Mr. Waggoner sent an e-mail to the Board providing a summary of his conversation with
CEO A and an update on the status of discussions with TJC, including the feedback that TJC provided
Morgan Stanley on price. In anticipation of receiving a written indication of interest from Strategic A, Mr.
Waggoner also scheduled a special meeting of the Board for August 16, 2021.
On August 16, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a letter from Strategic A reflecting its interest in purchasing
Echo at a valuation ranging from $44.00 - $47.00 per share, with the consideration payable in cash. In the
letter, Strategic A indicated it would be able to complete its diligence and be in position to enter into
definitive agreement within three to four weeks. The letter also stated that Strategic A’s proposal would be
withdrawn on August 18, 2021, unless Strategic A was granted exclusivity. Mr. Waggoner forwarded a copy
of the letter to the Board in advance of the previously scheduled special meeting of the Board.
At the special meeting of the Board on August 16, 2021, the Board, with representatives of Morgan Stanley
and Winston in attendance, reviewed the key terms of a proposed draft of the merger agreement that was
contemplated to be sent to TJC and, if applicable, Strategic A. As part of this discussion, the Board also
reviewed the treatment of incentive equity awards that, under the draft merger agreement, were contemplated
to be accelerated. The Board also reviewed the letter received from Strategic A, including the request for
exclusivity, and discussed the strategy for engaging with TJC and Strategic A in a manner designed to
maximize value for Echo’s stockholders. The Board emphasized to Echo’s management and advisors the
importance of maintaining competitive tension by keeping both parties engaged and the objective of
structuring the process in a manner that positioned each party to present to the Board at approximately the
same time fully negotiated, best and final terms that were not subject to any further diligence.
Following the meeting, and at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley advised
Strategic A that Echo was willing to engage in discussions concerning a potential transaction and, subject to
execution of a mutually acceptable non-disclosure agreement, to provide further information in connection
with the process. At the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley also advised Strategic A
that Echo was not in a position to grant Strategic A exclusivity and that it would be advisable for Strategic A
to proceed with requisite diligence as expeditiously as possible and prepare to submit a final bid in the first
week of September 2021. Later that day, a form of non-disclosure agreement was provided to Strategic A
through Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also advised TJC, at the direction of the Board,
that Echo was not prepared to provide a counter proposal but was willing to proceed with due diligence with
the guidance that TJC would have to improve its price in its final bid. The Morgan Stanley representatives
discussed the transaction process, including that Winston would share a draft of the merger agreement and
would expect TJC to provide a markup and submit a final bid in the first week of September 2021.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 17, 2021, a non-disclosure agreement with Strategic A was signed. The non-disclosure agreement
was consistent with the terms of the non-disclosure agreement executed by Strategic A in connection with
the 2019 Process. This non-disclosure agreement included a standstill provision that terminated upon the
entry by Echo into definitive agreements with respect to certain transactions, including a sale of 50% or more
of the voting power of Echo. In connection with the execution of the non-disclosure agreement, Strategic A
confirmed that, subject to protocols designed to limit disclosure of competitively sensitive information, it
would engage a third-party consultant to complete an analysis of customer and carrier overlap between Echo
and Strategic A similar to the analysis undertaken by Strategic A in the 2019 Process.
On August 19, 2021, Strategic A and its counsel were provided access to the virtual data room containing
business and legal diligence materials and Winston provided a draft of the merger agreement to counsel for
TJC and Strategic A, respectively, with the request that comments be provided in the form of detailed written
mark-ups by August 27, 2021. Key features of these first drafts of the merger agreement that were delivered
to TJC and Strategic A included the following:
The draft merger agreement provided to TJC was tailored to reflect TJC’s status as a financial
sponsor, including in order to contemplate customary representations and warranties on financing
commitment letters, the delivery by TJC of a limited guaranty, debt financing covenants and a reverse
termination fee of 6.0% of the equity value of the transaction that would be payable, as a non-
exclusive remedy, in the event of a debt financing failure by TJC’s lenders;
The draft merger agreement delivered to each party contemplated a provision, commonly referred to
as a “hell or high water” covenant, pursuant to which the purchaser was required to take any and all
steps to avoid or eliminate each and every objection to the transaction that might be asserted by a
governmental authority under applicable antitrust laws; and
The draft merger agreement delivered to each party contemplated a termination fee of 2.0% of the
equity value of the transaction payable by Echo in the event Echo terminated the merger agreement in
order to enter into a superior proposal or the Board made a change in recommendation and, following
termination by either party as a result of such change in recommendation, entered into an acquisition
proposal within a tail period following such termination.
On August 20, 2021, a draft clean team agreement relating to the proposed overlap analysis was sent to
Strategic A. Discussions ensued and on August 22, 2021, a clean team agreement among Echo, Strategic A
and the third-party consultant engaged by Strategic A to conduct the overlap analysis was executed.
Subsequently, customer and carrier information was independently provided to the third-party consultant by
each of Strategic A and Echo.
On August 24, 2021, representatives of Strategic A (including representatives from the financial advisor
retained by Strategic A), Echo and Morgan Stanley met in the Chicago offices of Winston to attend a
management presentation and to conduct in-person diligence on Echo’s business, strategy, and operations.
On August 26, 2021, TJC’s counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”) provided Winston with a detailed
markup on the draft merger agreement. These comments included, among other things, the following:
The introduction of a 60-day marketing period for the debt financing contemplated by its proposal;
Increased the company termination fee from 2% of the equity value of the transaction to 3.75% of the
equity value of the transaction;
Added an expense reimbursement requirement or Buyer’s expenses in the event Echo failed to secure
stockholder approval for the transaction;
Provided that the reverse termination fee would be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy in the
event of a debt financing failure; and
Rejected Echo’s request for a nine month outside date (extendable to twelve months in the event all
conditions were satisfied other than antitrust approvals having been obtained), without providing a
specific counter-proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 27, 2021, Kirkland provided Winston with initial drafts of the equity commitment letter and limited
guaranty contemplated by the proposed merger agreement with TJC.
On August 30, 2021 Strategic A’s counsel provided Winston with a detailed markup on the draft merger
agreement. These comments included, among other things, the following:
Required certain stockholders of Echo, including Echo’s directors, to enter into voting agreements at
signing in order to support the transaction;
Rejected the “hell or high water” covenant requested by Echo, including by specifically limiting
Strategic A’s obligations in connection with securing antitrust approvals for the transaction;
Introduced language that Strategic A would control and lead all communications and strategy in
connection with seeking antitrust approvals;
Increased the company termination fee from 2% of the equity value of the transaction to 4% of the
enterprise value of the transaction; and
Reduced the general outside date from nine months to six months (but maintained the extension to
twelve months in the event all conditions were satisfied other than antitrust approvals having been
obtained).
On August 30, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley, in the course of a discussion with TJC on the
process and next steps, and at the direction of the Board, confirmed that another party was involved in the
process, was operating on substantially the same timeline as TJC and had indicated a purchase price that
was superior to the $40.00 offered by TJC. The Morgan Stanley representatives noted that TJC would have
the opportunity to increase its offer in presenting its final proposal to the Board.
A special meeting of the Board was held on September 1, 2021. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Winston attended the meeting. During the meeting, the Morgan Stanley representatives provided an update
on the process, including a summary of its discussion with TJC relating to the involvement of another party
in the process. Winston reviewed key terms in the merger agreement, including issues raised in the
respective mark-ups. At this time, the Board also discussed the potential need to implement retention
arrangements in order to minimize disruption to Echo’s business in the event of a transaction announcement.
During the course of this discussion, in light of Echo’s performance in 2021 and the substantial likelihood
that participants in Echo’s equity incentive plan would achieve maximum permitted bonuses under such plan
based on such performance, the Board discussed and approved introducing into the draft merger agreement
a requirement that the acquirer agree that executives participating in such plan would receive, subject to
continued employment through December 31, 2021, a bonus for 2021 of not less than the maximum bonus
amount permitted under the annual incentive plan Following the meeting, and at the direction of the Board,
representatives of Morgan Stanley advised TJC and Strategic A that their final proposals, together with final
comments on the merger agreement, should be presented by 5:00 p.m. CT, on Tuesday, September 7, 2021. A
special meeting of the Board was set for September 8, 2021, to review proposals.
On September 1, 2021, Winston sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland. The comments in
the revised draft of the merger agreement included, among other things, the following:
A reduction of the requested marketing period from 60 days to 45 days;
A decrease of the requested termination fee of 3.75% of the equity value of the transaction to 2.5% of
the equity value of the transaction;
A rejection of the request for expense reimbursement in the event Echo failed to secure stockholder
approval for the transaction;
An acceptance of the reverse termination fee as the sole and exclusive monetary remedy in the event
of a debt financing failure, but subject to an additional expense and interest recovery in the event the
reverse termination fee (or company termination fee) was not paid when due; and
Provided for a general outside date of six months (extendable to nine months in the event all
conditions were satisfied other than antitrust approvals having been obtained).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 2, 2021, Winston sent a revised draft of merger agreement to Strategic A’s counsel. The
comments in the revised draft of the merger agreement included, among other things, the following:
A rejection of the request for voting agreements to be delivered by stockholders of Echo at signing;
A reinstatement of the “hell or high water” covenant;
A rejection of the language that would defer to Strategic A to control and lead all communications and
strategy in connection with seeking antitrust approvals; and
A decrease of the requested company termination fee of 4% of the enterprise value of the transaction
to 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction.
Later on the same day, Winston also sent Kirkland written comments on the draft equity commitment letter
and limited guaranty.
On September 2, 2021, a report on the overlap analysis conducted by the third-party consultant was
provided to Echo and Strategic A, respectively, under the terms of the clean term agreement.
On September 3, 2021, Winston held a call with Kirkland in order to discuss process and next steps. On this
call, Kirkland asked if Winston would be willing to review a further revised draft of the merger agreement
prior to the final bid submission and, thereafter, provide feedback on the draft in order to permit TJC to
further improve its bid based on guidance from Winston. Winston confirmed its willingness to review a
further revised draft of the merger agreement and provide such feedback to Kirkland.
Later on the same day, Winston reached out to Strategic A’s counsel in order to extend to them the same
opportunity to provide a further revised draft of the merger agreement prior to the final bid submission in
order to receive feedback and guidance from Winston.
On September 4, 2021, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Winston. On the same day,
Kirkland also sent Winston revised drafts of the equity commitment letter and the limited guaranty.
On September 5, 2021, Winston and Kirkland met by videoconference to review open issues related to TJC’s
draft of merger agreement. At the beginning of this call, Winston focused its feedback on key issues,
including the following:
The outside date of five months proposed in the most recent draft of the merger agreement should be
increased to six months;
The continued request for expense reimbursement in the event Echo failed to secure stockholder
approval for the transaction would not be viewed favorably if it was included in the final bid
submission;
The cap proposed in the most recent draft on expense and interest in the event the reverse
termination fee (or company termination fee) was not paid when due should be eliminated or, at the
minimum, increased;
The company termination fee proposed in the most recent draft of 3.5% of the equity value of the
transaction was higher than desired by the Board; and
The need to be provided, as soon as possible, a draft of TJC’s debt commitment letter.
Thereafter, Winston also provided Kirkland with more detailed feedback on the merger agreement so that, in
connection with TJC preparing its final bid submission, other issues that Winston identified as remaining in
the markup could be eliminated or improved. Winston also indicated to Kirkland that the equity commitment
letter and limited guaranty were nearly in executable form, but provided Kirkland with comments on open
points in the equity commitment letter.
Later on the same day, Strategic A’s counsel sent Winston a revised draft of the merger agreement.
On September 6, 2021, Winston and Strategic A’s counsel met by videoconference to discuss the overlap
analysis and prior experiences with antitrust review in this industry (including with respect to prior deals
entered into by Strategic A). Thereafter, Winston provided feedback to Strategic A’s counsel on the revised
draft of the merger agreement recently provided by them. Among the issues addressed during this call was
34

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Strategic A’s refusal to agree to the “hell or highwater” covenant requested by Echo. Although Winston
noted that Strategic A had improved the strength of the covenants it was providing, Winston indicated that
if Strategic A was unwilling to provide a “hell or highwater” covenant, it would be expected to agree to a
reverse termination fee of 6% of the equity value of the transaction in the event the transaction failed to
close due to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals.
Other points of key feedback that Winston provided to Strategic A’s counsel so that Strategic A could
improve the quality of its bid in connection with a best and final bid submission included the following:
The company termination fee proposed in the most recent draft of 3.5% of the enterprise value of the
transaction was higher than desired by the Board;
The markup to the interim operating covenants raised concerns from a conditionality perspective; and
The markup to the representations and warranties remained purchaser aggressive and would
unacceptably lengthen the timeline to signing.
On September 6, 2021, Kirkland sent Winston a draft of the debt commitment letter contemplated by the
proposed merger agreement with TJC. This debt commitment letter was provided by creditworthy lending
institutions and was assessed to be on customary terms and conditions for a transaction of this kind.
On September 7, 2021, TJC submitted a “final proposal” letter in which it indicated that it had completed all
diligence and stood ready and willing to sign definitive agreements with respect to the transaction
immediately. The final proposal offered to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Echo for cash
consideration of $44.00 per share, which represented a 37.3% premium to the closing price on September 7,
2021, and a 20.4% premium to the then all-time high closing price on May 5, 2021.
As part of its final proposal letter, TJC also submitted further revised and improved documentation,
including with respect to the draft merger agreement. The improvements on key terms in the revised draft of
the merger agreement included:
TJC removed its request for expense reimbursement in the event Echo failed to secure stockholder
approval for the transaction; and
The cap was increased to $10 million for expense and interest recoveries available in the event the
reverse termination fee (or company termination fee) was not paid when due.
However, TJC did not agree to reduce the company termination fee below 3.5% of the equity value of the
transaction.
The TJC final proposal stated that it would expire if not accepted by 9:00 p.m. on September 8, 2021.
Later in the day on September 7, 2021, Strategic A submitted a letter with a “final offer” to acquire all of the
outstanding capital stock of Echo for cash consideration of $44 per share. Strategic A did not, however,
submit a further revised draft of the merger agreement. Instead, Strategic A’s counsel sent an email to
Winston indicating that Strategic A would not agree to a reverse termination fee in the event the transaction
failed to close due to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals but would be reasonable on the remaining open
issues in the draft merger agreement. Strategic A indicated that it had “substantially completed” due
diligence, but that the proposal would expire at 5:00 p.m. on September 9, 2021, unless Strategic A was
selected by Echo to enter into exclusive negotiations.
Early in the morning of September 8, 2021, the Board convened a special meeting to review the proposals
from TJC and Strategic A with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. The Morgan
Stanley representatives provided the Board with a review of both bid submissions and certain financial
analysis. The Board then engaged in significant discussion with respect to the two bids. This discussion
included a focused discussion on the execution risk presented by each proposed transaction, including the
risk of a failure to obtain antitrust approvals in connection with Strategic A’s proposed transaction and the
risk of a debt financing failure in the case of TJC’s proposed transaction. The Board also considered the
available recourse in the event of a failure to close in each of these circumstances and the likely impact to
Echo’s stockholders in the event of a failure to close each transaction. As part of this
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
discussion the Board noted that the announcement of a transaction with Strategic A might be more
disruptive to Echo’s business relationships and thus, that the cost of a failed transaction with Strategic A
may be higher than the cost of a failed transaction with TJC. The Board also believed, based on the prior
indications of interest received from the parties that Strategic A would be able to increase its offer from the
$44 per share valuation contemplated by its final offer and that TJC may not be able to further improve its
offer. In addition, the Board noted that if both parties remained at the same price per share, the TJC bid
would be preferable because it presented higher certainty of closing and the impact of a failed transaction
with TJC would be less harmful to Echo and its stockholders. Accordingly, following this discussion, the
Board directed Morgan Stanley to reach out to Strategic A’s financial advisors and advise them that Strategic
A was not the leading bidder. The Board also directed Morgan Stanley to encourage Strategic A to consider
increasing the price per share in its offer, reduce the company termination fee and include a reverse
termination fee to compensate Echo in the event the transaction failed to close due to a failure to obtain
antitrust approvals. Morgan Stanley was also directed to communicate that if Strategic A’s offer was not
improved by noon, then Echo would select the other party as the winning bidder.
After receiving the foregoing feedback from Morgan Stanley, Strategic A indicated that it would re-convene
its board of directors to consider updating its proposal in order address the feedback provided by the Board.
That afternoon, CEO A orally conveyed to Mr. Waggoner a revised proposal with a price of $46.50 per share,
a company termination fee of 3% of the equity value of the transaction and a reverse termination fee of 5.0%
of the equity value of the transaction, which would be payable in the event the transaction failed to close
due to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals.
Following receipt of this improved offer, representatives of Morgan Stanley advised TJC that the competing
proposal was superior in terms of price and break fee and asked if TJC was in a position to increase its
purchase price to match or exceed $46.50 and to also reduce the company termination fee it had proposed
from 3.5% of the equity value of the transaction to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction. In response,
TJC indicated that it would increase its offer to $46.50 and that it would accept a company termination fee of
3.0% of the equity value of the transaction.
The Board reconvened a special meeting during the afternoon of September 8, 2021, with representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. In light of TJC’s increased price to $46.50, which equaled the
proposal provided by Strategic A and the Board’s view that the execution risk associated with Strategic A
was greater because of antitrust risk, the Board determined that a transaction should be pursued with TJC.
Later that day, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley called Strategic A’s advisor
to inform Strategic A that the Board had decided to accept the competing bid and was likely to announce a
transaction in the next 24 hours. Thereafter, CEO A called Mr. Waggoner and expressed his disappointment.
Later that evening, CEO A advised Mr. Waggoner by text message that Strategic A would present a further
revised proposal the following morning.
Early in the morning of September 9, 2021, Strategic A sent a letter to Morgan Stanley with a “best and final”
offer that increased its offer from $46.50 per share to $47.00 per share and increased its proposed reverse
termination fee from 5% of the equity value of the transaction to 6% of the equity value of the transaction.
The letter stated that, following final Board approval on September 10, 2021, Strategic A would be in a
position to sign and announce the transaction before market open on Monday, September 13, 2021.
After receiving the increased offer from Strategic A, Morgan Stanley, Winston, Mr. Waggoner and Skinner
met via conference call to discuss next steps in light of Strategic A’s revised proposal.
Following this discussion, representatives of Morgan Stanley had a discussion with CEO A to let him know
that the Board was asking both parties for best and final proposals by 1:00 p.m. CT. CEO A confirmed in that
conversation that the offer of $47.00 per share indicated in its letter was Strategic A’s best and final proposal.
The Morgan Stanley representatives also advised TJC that a revised proposal was submitted by the other
bidder with a superior price and so the Board had requested both parties to submit their best and final
proposal by 1:00 p.m. CT. In response, TJC increased its offer to $48.25, but indicated this increased price
was conditioned on the merger agreement being executed promptly after market close that same day.

Also on September 9, 2021, the Board convened a special meeting via videoconference at 3:00 p.m. CT with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed
with the Board certain financial analyses. Winston provided an overview of the Board’s fiduciary duties in
the context of change of control. The Morgan Stanley representatives then rendered Morgan Stanley’s oral
opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board that, as of that date, and based upon
and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the
merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Echo’s common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Echo’s common stock (other
than the holders of Excluded Shares (as defined below) or any of Buyer’s affiliates). Following discussion,
the Board unanimously determined that the transaction proposed by TJC was fair to, and in the best
interests of, Echo and its stockholders, unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement,
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and authorized Echo to enter
into the merger agreement.
Following the board meeting, TJC and Echo finalized the transaction documents. In the early evening of
September 9, 2021, the parties executed the merger agreement and on the morning of September 10, 2021,
Echo issued a press release announcing the transaction.",32,42
"Echo Global Logistics, Inc._20211021_DEFM14A_19595960_4315476.Pdf",Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board,"Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board
The Board unanimously recommends that the Echo stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the
merger agreement at the special meeting.
The Board, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, evaluated the merger agreement, the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, unanimously determined that the merger
is fair to, and in the best interests of, Echo and its stockholders, unanimously approved and declared
advisable the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and authorized Echo to enter into the merger agreement. Accordingly, on September 9, 2021, the
Board unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Echo approve the merger agreement.
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board considered the following material factors relating to
the merger agreement and the merger, each of which the Board believes supported its decision:
Attractive Value. The Board believes the $48.25 per share cash price provided stockholders with
attractive value for their shares of Echo common stock. The Board considered the current and
historical prices of Echo common stock, including the market performance in light of current industry
conditions, and the fact that $48.25 per share in cash represented a substantial premium in reference
to a variety of stock price measurements. For instance, the $48.25 per share price constitutes a
premium of approximately 54% to the price of Echo’s common stock on September 9, 2021 (the day
before the announcement of the transaction) and a premium of approximately 32% over Echo’s pre-
announcement all time high closing share price on September 10, 2018. In addition, the $48.25 per
share cash consideration implied strong transaction multiples, such as 12.0x Echo’s EBITDA for the
12 months ended June 30, 2021.
Best Alternative for Maximizing Shareholder Value. The Board concluded that entering into the
merger agreement was more favorable to Echo and its stockholders than the other alternatives
reasonably available to Echo, including the continued operation of Echo on a standalone basis and
the pursuit of other potential actionable strategic or financial transactions. This conclusion took into
consideration, among other things:
the Board’s assessment of Echo’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and
historical and projected financial performance. The Board considered the nature of Echo’s
industry and potential changes and developments in that industry, including the challenges
faced by industry participants and the attendant risks attributable to remaining as a public
company;
the strategic and financial alternatives reasonably available to Echo in terms of possible
business combinations with third-parties other than Buyer, taking into account the 2016 Process,
the 2019 Process, and the bid received by Strategic A;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Board’s belief that the risk of actively pursuing alternative transactions considerably
exceeded the Board’s assessment of the potential benefits that might be achieved and risked
jeopardizing the value to be delivered to stockholders in this transaction and the other reasons
discussed in this proxy statement; and
the Board’s belief that the $48.25 per share merger consideration was the maximum amount that
Buyer would offer to pay to acquire Echo.
Opportunity to Receive Alternative Proposals and to Terminate the merger agreement to Accept a
Superior Proposal. The Board considered the terms of the merger agreement relating to Echo’s ability
to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals and the other terms of the merger agreement,
including:
Echo’s right, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in response to, and to discuss
and negotiate, certain unsolicited acquisition proposals made before stockholder approval of the
merger is obtained;
The Board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third-parties
from making a superior proposal;
The Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that
Echo’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement;
the Board’s ability to terminate the merger agreement prior to obtaining stockholder approval of
the merger, in specified circumstances relating to a superior proposal, subject to payment of a
termination fee which the Board believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, consistent
with or below similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
Certainty of Value. The Board considered that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, thereby
providing Echo’s stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Echo common
stock, especially when viewed against the risks and uncertainties inherent in Echo’s business,
including risks associated with executing upon Echo’s current and long-term strategies in light of the
competitive marketplace.
Likelihood of Completion. The Board considered the likelihood of completion of the merger to be a
significant factor in support of the transaction, in light of, among other things:
Echo’s ability to, under certain circumstances, specifically enforce the agreement to prevent
breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce the terms of the merger agreement, including
the consummation of the merger;
the consummation of the merger not being subject to a financing condition;
the reverse termination fee of $79,176,000.00 that would become payable to Echo under certain
circumstances (as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - 
Company Termination Fee; Buyer Termination Fee”);
the expectation that the outside date of March 9, 2022 is likely to allow for sufficient time to
complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
the conditions to closing in the merger agreement, which the Board believes are reasonable and
customary in number and scope, and which, in the case of the conditions related to the absence
of material adverse changes between the announcement and closing of the transaction and the
accuracy of Echo’s representations and warranties, are generally qualified by a traditional public
company “material adverse effect” standard.
Business Reputation of TJC. The business reputation and financial reputation of TJC. The Board
believed that these factors supported the conclusion that a transaction with Buyer (which is owned
by TJC) could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner, and had a substantial likelihood of
being consummated successfully.
Receipt of Fairness Opinion from Morgan Stanley. The Board considered the oral opinion of Morgan
Stanley (subsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of such date and based

TABLE OF CONTENTS
upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its
written opinion, the merger consideration of $48.25 per share in cash to be received by the holders of
Echo common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Echo common stock (other than the holders of Excluded Shares or any of Buyer’s
affiliates). See, “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Opinion of Morgan Stanley.”
Long-term Interests of Echo. The Board considered that, in addition to providing an attractive
outcome for the holders of Echo common stock and the best alternative reasonably available for
maximizing stockholder value, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement also promote
and advance the long-term interests of Echo and its other stakeholders, including employees,
customers, and suppliers.
Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders
who timely and properly exercise such appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board also considered the risks and potentially negative
factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including:
that Echo stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Echo following the merger, and
that such stockholders will therefore cease to participate in the future earnings or growth that Echo
may achieve, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of Echo’s common stock as a result of
the merger;
as the transaction has a potential outside date of March 9, 2022, that Echo stockholders could be
asked to vote on and approve the merger agreement well in advance of the completion of the
transaction, depending on when the transaction actually closes;
the announcement and pendency of the merger, or that the failure to complete the merger, may cause
substantial harm to Echo’s business, sales operations, financial results, and Echo’s relationships with
its current or prospective employees;
the risk of management distraction as a result of the merger;
the restrictions in the merger agreement on Echo’s ability to solicit competing proposals (subject to
certain exceptions to allow the Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior
proposal, and then only upon the payment of a termination fee);
the merger agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of Echo’s business before completion of the
merger, generally requiring Echo to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting Echo
from taking specified actions, which may delay or prevent Echo from undertaking unanticipated
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger (as more fully described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conduct of Business Pending the merger”);
the possibility that Echo may be required under the terms of the merger agreement to pay a
termination fee of $39,588,000 under certain circumstances (as more fully described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee; Buyer Termination Fee”);
the reverse termination fee of $79,176,000.00 that would become payable to Echo under certain
circumstances (as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Company
Termination Fee; Buyer Termination Fee”) is not payable by Buyer to Echo in all instances in which
the merger agreement may be terminated and such reverse termination fee may not be sufficient to
compensate Echo for the damage suffered by Echo during this period;
that the receipt of cash by Echo stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock pursuant
to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction to Echo stockholders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (as more fully described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of merger”); and
the interests that Echo’s directors and executive officers may have in the merger, which may be
different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.

In connection with the merger, the Company’s management prepared a set of non-public, unaudited financial
forecasts with respect to the Company’s business for fiscal years 2021 through 2025 (the “Company
Projections”). The Company Projections were provided to the Company’s Board and the Company’s financial
advisor in connection with their respective consideration and evaluation of the merger.
The Company does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance for extended
periods beyond one fiscal year due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting
financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates.
However, the Company is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited
prospective financial information for the Company, without giving effect to the merger, solely to give
Company stockholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Company’s Board, the
Company’s financial advisor and Buyer for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion
of the Company Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the
Company, Buyer or any of their respective boards of directors or representatives or any other recipient of
this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or
an accurate prediction of future results, and the Company Projections should not be relied on as such.
The Company Projections, and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were
based, are subjective in many respects, and subject to different interpretations and potential revisions
attributable to the nature of the transportation and supply chain management business, as well as actual
experience and business developments. While presented with numerical specificity, the Company Projections
are forward-looking and reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company performance, industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and
beyond the Company’s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” could cause the Company Projections
or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company
Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected.
Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable
with each successive year.
The Company Projections were prepared in good faith by Company management based on their reasonable
best estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected future financial performance of the Company at
the time the Company Projections were prepared and speak only as of that time. Economic and business
environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to
whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be achieved. The inclusion of the Company
Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company or
any other person that the information is material.
The summary of the Company Projections is provided in this proxy statement solely for informational
purposes only and is not provided to influence Company stockholders’ decisions regarding whether to vote
for the merger proposal or any other proposal.
The Company Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”), the

Adjusted Gross Profit is defined for purposes of the Company Projections as revenue less
transportation costs (excludes internal use software depreciation). This Non-GAAP measure is different
from measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar
measures used by other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income
or net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined for purposes of the Company Projections as net income before interest
expense, investment and other income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, excluding stock
compensation expense. This Non-GAAP measure is different from measures determined in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should
not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating
performance or cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.
This Non-GAAP measure is different from measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may

Earnings Per Share calculated using weighted average shares outstanding as of July 27, 2021.
The Company Projections include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance
with GAAP and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The
Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for
stockholders to use in evaluating the Company’s potential future operating results and trends. These non-
GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures
determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are
provided, they are presented on a non-GAAP basis without reconciliations of such forward-looking non-
GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and
quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation
The Company Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on the Company
of the merger and do not attempt to predict or suggest future results of the combined company. The
Company Projections do not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the
merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the effect
on the Company of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of
the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions
that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead
altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Company Projections
do not take into account the effect on the Company of any possible failure of the merger to occur.

For the foregoing reasons and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the
Company Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information,
readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company Projections
set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the information
included in the Company Projections. The Company urges all Company stockholders to review its most
recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section entitled “Where You Can
Find Additional Information.”
In addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after
the date the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, or to reflect
financial targets issued by the Company after the date the Company Projections were prepared, and except
as required by applicable securities laws, the Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the
Company Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when
made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are
shown to be in error.",45,47

Morgan Stanley was retained by the Company to act as its financial advisor and to render a financial opinion
in connection with a potential sale of the Company. The Company selected Morgan Stanley to act as its
financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s experience in transactions similar to the merger, qualifications,
expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the Company and its business and the industries in which the
Company conducts its business. On September 9, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Company’s Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion,
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan
Stanley’s written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
shares of Company common stock (other than the holders of shares held in treasury or held by Buyer or
Merger Sub or as to which dissenters’ rights have been perfected (collectively referred to herein as the
“Excluded Shares”, or any of Buyer’s affiliates).
The full text of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion to the Company’s Board, dated September 9, 2021, is
attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion
sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its
opinion. Stockholders of the Company are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Company’s Board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only
the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be
received pursuant to the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than
the holders of the Excluded Shares or any of Buyer’s affiliates). Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address
any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or
aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or
amended in connection therewith and does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be
achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or recommendation as
to how the holders of shares of Company common stock should vote at any stockholders’ meeting to be held
in connection with the merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information
of the Company;
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company
with senior executives of the Company;
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company common stock;
compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the
Company common stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the
Company, and their securities;
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and
Buyer and their financial and legal advisors;
reviewed the merger agreement, the debt commitment letter from certain lenders dated as of September
7, 2021 and the draft equity commitment letter from The Resolute Fund V, L.P. substantially in the form
of the draft dated as of September 9, 2021 (together, the “Commitment Letters”), and the limited
guaranty from The Resolute Fund V, L.P. to the Company substantially in the form of the draft dated
as of September 9, 2021; and
performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed
appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
With respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the
merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any
waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Buyer will obtain
financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letters and that the definitive merger
agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or
other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected
to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley noted that it is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.
Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment
of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.
Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company common stock in the
transaction. Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other
agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection
therewith. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
the Company, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, September 9, 2021. Events occurring after such date may
affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not
assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter dated September 9, 2021 to the
Company’s Board. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the
financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor
does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses.
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together
43 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering
any portion of such analyses and of the factors, without considering all analyses and factors reviewed,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based
on market data as it existed on or before September 8, 2021.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley, at the
direction of the Company’s Board, used and relied upon certain financial projections provided by Company
management and referred to in this proxy statement (and defined in the section entitled “ - Certain Echo
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 48) as the “Company projections”. For
more information, see the section entitled “ - Certain Echo Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”
beginning on page 48.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of
a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal
value of a company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied values per share of Company common
stock based on estimates of future unlevered free cash flows for the third and fourth calendar quarters in
2021 and each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2025 contained in the Company projections. Although growth
rates may be higher or lower in any given year, Morgan Stanley then calculated a terminal value for the
Company by applying a range of perpetual growth rates to the estimated unlevered free cash flow for 2025
ranging from 1.75% to 2.25 % based upon its professional judgment and experience. The estimated unlevered
free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2021
by assuming the mid-year convention and using a range of discount rates of between 7.4% and 8.9%, which
range of discount rates was selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and
experience, to reflect the Company’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Based on this analysis,
Morgan Stanley derived a range of estimated implied values per share of Company common stock of $33.00
to $45.75, rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the merger consideration payable pursuant to the
merger agreement of $48.25 per share.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a
theoretical estimate of the future implied value of a company’s common equity as a function of estimated
future earnings per share (“EPS”) and a potential range of ratios of share price to estimated EPS (such ratio,
the “Price / EPS multiple”).
In arriving at the estimated equity values per share of Company common stock, Morgan Stanley selected a
representative range of Price/EPS multiples ranging from 14.0x to 16.0x based on the comparable company
analysis described below under “ - Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Analysis” and upon the
application of its professional judgment and experience to the estimated one-year forward EPS of the

management in the Company projections as EPS of the Company for the 12-month period ending December
31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting ranges of equity
value per share of Company common stock to June 30, 2021 at a discount rate of 8.2%, selected by Morgan
Stanley based on the application of its professional judgment and experience to reflect the Company’s cost
of equity. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived a range of implied values per share of Company
common stock as follows, each rounded to the nearest $0.25:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed a publicly traded comparable companies analysis, which attempts to provide an
implied value of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley
reviewed and compared, using publicly available information, certain future financial information for the
Company with corresponding future financial information, ratios and public market multiples for other
companies that shared certain similar characteristics to the Company (the “Comparable Companies”). For
purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the Price / EPS multiples and ratios of the aggregate
value (“AV”) (calculated as the market value of equity plus preferred stock plus book value of total debt,
plus non-controlling interests (as appropriate for the company being analyzed) net of cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities) to estimated EBITDA (“AV / EBITDA multiples”) for calendar year 2022, based on
Refinitiv consensus estimates, of the following companies:
The Company
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“CHRW”)
J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (“JBHTS”)
Landstar System, Inc. (“Landstar”)
Forward Air Corporation (“Forward Air”)
Hub Group, Inc. (“Hub Group”)
Results of the analysis were presented for the companies, as indicated in the following tables:

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the Comparable Companies and taking into
consideration the different business, financial and operating characteristics of the Comparable Companies as
compared to the Company and considering historical AV / EBITDA trading multiples of the Company and
upon the application of its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of Price /
EPS multiples for calendar year 2022 and applied these ranges of multiples to estimates of calendar year 2022
EPS of $2.36 and $2.37, based on Refinitiv consensus estimates as of September 8, 2021 for the Company and
as provided by the Company management in the Company projections, respectively, and representative
ranges of AV / EBITDA multiples for calendar year 2022 and applied these ranges of multiples to estimates of
calendar year 2022 EBITDA of $115 million and $113 million, based on Refinitiv consensus estimates as of
September 8, 2021 for the Company and as provided by the Company management in the Company
projections, respectively. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of estimated implied values per share of the
Company’s common stock as follows, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, as compared to the merger
consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement of $48.25 per share:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
No company utilized in the publicly traded comparable companies analysis is identical to the Company and
hence the foregoing summary and underlying financial analyses involved considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
public trading or other values of the companies to which the Company was compared. In evaluating
Comparable Companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which
are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the business of the Company
and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of the Company or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical
analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using publicly traded comparable companies data.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial
analysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Company’s Board,
including the following information described below under the sections entitled “ - Historical Trading
Range”, “ - Relative Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets”, “ - Illustrative Leveraged Buyout
Analysis” and “ - Precedent Transactions Analysis”.
Historical Trading Range.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley reviewed the range of intraday prices of the Company common stock
over the 52-week period ended on September 8, 2021. For the 52-week period reviewed, Morgan Stanley
observed that the high and low closing prices of the Company common stock were $25.00 and $37.65 per
share, respectively.
Relative Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley reviewed future public market trading price targets for the Company
common stock prepared and published by ten equity research analysts prior to September 8, 2021. These
forward targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the 12-month future public market trading price of the
Company common stock. Morgan Stanley also discounted such 12-month future market trading price
estimates by the estimated cost of equity of 8.2% for the Company. Based on the foregoing, the indicative
discounted value range of the research analysts’ price targets for the Company, rounded to the nearest $0.25,
was $26.00 to $45.25 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect
current market trading prices for the Company common stock and these estimates are subject to
uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company, and future financial market
conditions.
Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley performed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the
prices at which a financial sponsor might affect a leveraged buyout of the Company. Morgan Stanley based
its analysis on the Company Projections. Morgan Stanley assumed a transaction date of June 30, 2021, and a
4.5 year investment period ending December 31, 2025. Based on its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley assumed (i) a multiple of 6.0x of gross debt to leverageable Company EBITDA, (ii) a target
range of annualized internal rates of return for the financial sponsor of 17.5% to 22.5% and (iii) a range from
9.5 x to 11.0 x of AV / EBITDA exit multiples. Based on these calculations, this analysis indicated a range of
implied equity value per share of Company common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $36.00 to $43.50
per share.
Precedent Transactions Analysis.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which attempts to provide
an implied value of a company based on publicly available financial terms of selected precedent transactions.
Morgan Stanley deemed the transactions most relevant based on Morgan Stanley’s professional
46 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
judgment and experience. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley reviewed the ratio of the AV of the
transaction to the last 12 months EBITDA prior to the announcement date of the applicable transaction (such
ratio, the “AV / LTM EBITDA multiple”), based on publicly available financial information. The transactions
Morgan Stanley reviewed for purposes of this analysis included acquisition of Freightquote by CHRW in
January 2015 and acquisition of Command Transportation by Echo in April 2015.
Based on its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied AV / LTM EBITDA multiples of
10.7x and 11.4x to the Company’s EBITDA for the 12-months ending on June 30, 2021 of $114 million as
provided by Company management. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated estimated implied
values per share of Company common stock of $42.75 and $45.50, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, as
compared to the merger consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement of $48.25 per share.

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the
merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the
Company’s business or the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition or prospects of the Company or the industry, or in the financial markets in
general.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Company’s Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting
any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of
the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various
assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the range of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual
value of the Company.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These include, among other things, the impact of
competition on the business of the Company and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence
of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the industry,
and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement by the
holders of shares of Company common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares or any of
Buyer’s affiliates), and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated September 9, 2021 to the
Company’s Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of
Company common stock might actually trade.
The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and
Buyer, and was approved by the Company’s Board. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to the
47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Company’s Board during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to
the Company or the Company’s Board, nor opine that any specific consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Company’s Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Company’s Board in deciding to approve the execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Consequently, the
analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Company’s Board
with respect to the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Company’s
Board would have been willing to agree to different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved
by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its
customary practice.
The Company’s Board retained Morgan Stanley based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and
expertise and its familiarity with the Company. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in
the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities
business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,
commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing
and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest
on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers,
in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Buyer or their respective affiliates, or any other
company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative
instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working
with the Company in connection with this transaction, may have committed and may commit in the future to
invest in private equity funds managed by Buyer or its affiliates.
Under the terms of its engagement letter dated July 13, 2021, Morgan Stanley provided the Company
financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B, in connection with the merger. As compensation for Morgan Stanley’s financial advisory services,
the Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the
closing of the merger, of approximately $24 million (the “Morgan Stanley Transaction Fee”). As
compensation for Morgan Stanley rendering a financial opinion to the Company’s Board, the Company paid
Morgan Stanley a fee equal to $1.5 million, which will be credited against the Morgan Stanley Transaction
Fee payable if the merger is consummated. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for
its expenses incurred from time to time in connection with this engagement. In addition, the Company has
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates, against certain
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, and to
reimburse certain expenses relating to such indemnity.
In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing
services to Buyer and certain of its affiliates and expects to receive fees in connection with such services. In
the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not received any fees
from the Company in connection with financial advisory or financing services. Morgan Stanley may also
seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Buyer and the Company and their respective
affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.",47,53

The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Buyer. It is anticipated that the total amount of
funds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid at the closing of the merger by Buyer and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be
approximately $1,418.5 million in cash. In connection with the financing of the merger, The Resolute Fund V,
L.P. (the “TJC Fund”) and Buyer have entered into an equity commitment letter, dated September 9, 2021 (the
“Equity Commitment Letter”), in respect of the Equity Commitment. The Equity Commitment is equal to
$758.1 million in cash (the “Equity Commitment”).
48 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Buyer expects to finance the merger with debt financing, together with cash on hand (including proceeds
received pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter). In connection with entering into the merger agreement,
Buyer has entered into a second amended and restated commitment letter (the “Debt Commitment Letter”),
dated as of October 15, 2021, with Credit Suisse, Citi, BMO, Bank of Montreal, BNP, Citizens, KeyBank, UBS
Finance, UBS Securities, MUFG and Barings (collectively, and together with other financial institutions that
from time to time provide commitments thereunder, the “commitment parties”), pursuant to which, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, the applicable commitment parties have committed to provide (i) a
seven-year senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million, (ii)
an eight-year senior secured second lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $160.0 million
and (iii) a five-year senior secured first lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to
$100.0 million (collectively, the “credit facilities”), to fund a portion of the consideration for the merger,
refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company and related transaction fees, costs and expenses (the
“debt commitment”). The funding and availability of the credit facilities provided for in the Debt Commitment
Letter is contingent on the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including (1) the execution and delivery
of definitive documentation with respect to the credit facilities in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (2) the completion of the merger.
The Equity Commitment, the Debt Commitment, and unrestricted cash at the Company will be available (i) to
fund the aggregate purchase price, (ii) to repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect to the merger) the
principal of and interest on, and all other indebtedness and other amounts outstanding pursuant to, the
Company’s existing credit facilities, (iii) for working capital and other general corporate purposes and (iv) to
pay all fees, costs and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the merger by Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company contemplated by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the merger agreement. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter, the Company has a contractual right to
enforce the Equity Commitment Letter against the TJC Fund and, under the terms and subject to the
conditions of the merger agreement, the Company has the right to specifically enforce Buyer’s obligation to
consummate the merger upon receipt of the proceeds of the Debt Commitment.
Pursuant to the Limited Guaranty dated as of September 9, 2021 (the “Limited Guaranty”), delivered by the
TJC Fund in favor of the Company, the TJC Fund has agreed to guaranty the following payment obligations
of Buyer and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, which are subject to an aggregate cap equal to the
sum of all such payment obligations: (i) all or a portion of the $79,176,000 buyer termination fee if required,
on the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement; (ii) any amounts in respect of
certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub for certain costs, expenses
or losses incurred or sustained by the Company in connection with providing financing cooperation to
Buyer, as further specified in the merger agreement (the “Reimbursement Obligations”); and (iii) any amounts
in respect of certain out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to the Company’s
efforts to obtain payment of the buyer termination fee, including any interest thereon at the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually
received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable law, as specified in the merger
agreement; provided, that in no event shall such collection costs exceed $10,000,000.

In considering the recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors that Company stockholders vote to
approve the merger agreement, Company stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive
officers of Echo have potential interests in the proposed merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Company’s Board of Directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation that Company
stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement. See the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) -
Background of the Merger” and the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Echo Board of Directors.” These interests are described in more detail below, and
certain of them are quantified in the narrative and the table below.
These material interests are summarized below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all Company restricted
stock awards, performance shares and restricted stock units.
Certain of the Company’s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation
and benefits under existing agreements between such officers and the Company.
The merger agreement provides for the payment of minimum annual bonuses to the Company’s
executive officers for calendar year 2021.
The Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and
insurance coverage under indemnification agreements and the merger agreement.
Arrangements with Parent
Any Company executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who
otherwise are retained to provide services to Parent or the surviving corporation following the closing of the
merger, however, may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in cash
or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent or the surviving corporation. As of the date
of this proxy statement/prospectus, no compensation arrangements between such persons and Parent and/or
its affiliates have been established. Pursuant to the merger agreement, our executive officers will serve as
officers of the surviving corporation immediately following the effective time until their successors have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the surviving corporation’s charter and by-laws.
Treatment and Quantification of Outstanding Company Equity Awards
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Company equity awards held by directors and executive officers
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be subject to the following treatment:
Restricted Stock. At the effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the per share merger
consideration less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, as provided in
the merger agreement.
Performance Shares. At the effective time, each outstanding performance share, to the extent unvested, shall
vest either (1) as if the target level of performance had been achieved as of the effective time or (2) if
specifically provided under an individual employment agreement or award agreement in the event of a
“change of control,” at the greater of target or actual performance through the closing. All vested
performance shares shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in
cash equal to the product of (1) the total number of such vested performance shares multiplied by (2) the per
share merger consideration less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, as
provided in the merger agreement.
Restricted Stock Units. At the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit, vested or unvested, will
be a canceled and converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the per
share merger consideration less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment,
as provided in the merger agreement.

The consideration for Company restricted stock units in this column is equal to the number of shares of
Company common stock subject to the award multiplied by $48.25.
2021 Annual Bonus Payments
The merger agreement provides that, with respect to the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”), and
subject to the executive officer’s continuous employment with the Company or the surviving corporation or
its subsidiary through December 31, 2021, Parent will or will cause the surviving corporation to pay to such
executive officer a bonus for 2021 in an amount equal to the greater of (1) the bonus which the executive
officer would have been entitled to under the AIP for 2021 based on actual and individual performance
during the 2021 annual performance period (the “Actual 2021 Performance Bonus”) and (2) the “Executive
Minimum Bonus Amounts”  (as set forth in the disclosure schedules thereto). If the participant were to incur
a termination without cause or a termination for good reason (as referenced in the merger agreement and as
defined in their employment agreements) on or after the merger effective time, but prior to December 31, 2021,
the named executive officer also would be eligible to receive a bonus for 2021 in an amount equal to the
greater of the Actual 2021 Performance Bonus and the Executive Minimum Bonus Amount. The bonus
amount is payable, in each case, as soon as practicable following the completion of the Company’s 2021
audit and no later than March 15, 2022.
Contractual Change in Control Benefits
Pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements, upon the closing of the merger our named executive
officers are eligible for single-trigger accelerated vesting of 50% of their outstanding time-vested equity
awards (i.e., restricted stock and restricted stock units) and 50% of their outstanding performance-vested
awards (i.e., performance shares) at the greater of target or actual performance through the effective time of
the merger. Our named executive officers’ equity award agreements provide for single-trigger accelerated
vesting of 100% of their outstanding performance shares upon the closing of the merger, with 50% vesting at
target through the end of the performance period and 50% vesting based on the better of target or actual
performance through the date of closing. Pursuant to the merger agreement, upon the closing of the merger,
our named executive officers are eligible for single-trigger accelerated vesting of 100% of the executive
officers’ outstanding time-vested awards and 100% of their outstanding performance shares as if the target
level of performance had been achieved through the date of closing. The merger agreement also provides
that with respect to our named executive officers’ outstanding performance shares, if their individual
employment agreements or award agreements provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding
performance shares shall vest at the greater of target or actual performance through the date of closing, such
provision shall control with respect to the vesting of such performance shares (as is the case here under the
equity award agreements with respect to 50% of the named executive officers’ outstanding performance
shares). The named executive officers are thus eligible for acceleration of their outstanding time-vested
equity awards, acceleration of their outstanding performance vested awards, and a guaranteed amount of
their 2021 AIP payments under the merger agreement. Other than the single-trigger payments as indicated
above, our executive officers are not eligible for any other single-trigger payments upon the closing of the
merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our executive officers are eligible for certain double-trigger payments. Pursuant to the executive officers’
employment agreements, each executive officer is eligible for the following severance payments and benefits
in the event such executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the
executive officer for “good reason”  (in each case, as defined in their applicable employment agreement) in
the 3 months preceding the public announcement of the merger or the 12 months following the closing of the
merger, subject to the executive officer’s execution and nonrevocation of a general release in favor of the
Company within 10 business days following the receipt of a copy of the release from the Company:
Cash Severance: In addition to any accrued payments or benefits (i.e., accrued base salary), an amount
equal to the product of two times the sum of (A) base salary as in effect on the date of termination,
and (B) the greater of (x) the average of the three most recent annual performance bonuses received
preceding the date of termination or (y) target annual performance bonus in effect as of the date of
his termination, generally payable in a single lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date the general release becomes nonrevocable, unless such amount is subject to Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), in which case such amount shall be
payable in equal installments over a 24-month period following such termination of employment in
accordance with the Company’s normal payroll procedures;
Accelerated Vesting of Equity Awards: Immediate vesting of all outstanding unvested time-vesting
equity awards and any outstanding equity awards that would have vested based on performance (i.e.,
performance shares) at the greater of target or actual performance through the closing of the merger;
and
Continuation of COBRA Benefits: With respect to our named executive officers only, continuation of
Company-paid insurance benefits for our named executive officers and their dependents until the
earlier of: (i) 24 months following the termination for Messrs. Waggoner and Menzel and 12 months
following the termination for Mr. Rogers or (ii) the date the named executive officer has secured
comparable benefits through another organization’s benefits program.
Messrs. Waggoner and Menzel are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during their
employment term and for a period of 24 months following a termination of employment for any or no reason
and Mr. Rogers is subject to similar restrictions during his employment term and for a period of 12 months
following a termination of employment for any or no reason. Further, each named executive officer entered
into a confidentiality agreement upon joining the Company that would remain in place following a double-
trigger termination.
The employment agreements provide that any payments and benefits payable to the named executive officer
will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid any excise taxes on “excess parachute payments” that would
otherwise be imposed under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code (“280G Cutback”), solely to the
extent such reduction would put the named executive officer in a better position on an after-tax basis than if
he received the excess parachute payments subject to the excise tax (“Best Pay Cutback Provision”). None of
the executive officers are eligible for an excise tax gross-up.
For an estimate of the value of the severance benefits described above that would be payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with a change in control assuming a qualifying
termination on November 30, 2021, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Quantification of
Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” below.
Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated payments that each of
the Company’s named executive officers could receive that is based on or otherwise related to the merger.
These amounts have been calculated assuming (1) the merger was consummated and each named executive
officer experienced a qualifying termination on November 30, 2021, which is the assumed effective time solely
for purposes of the disclosure in this section, (2) a per share price of Company common stock of $48.25, (3)
each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in
effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (4) the equity awards subject to accelerated vesting are those
outstanding as of November 30, 2021 and (5) with respect to Code Section 280G, the full value of

all payments and benefits have been used and no potential reductions have been applied pursuant to the
Best Pay Cutback Provision in the employment agreements. See the section entitled “- Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” for further information about the compensation
disclosed in the table below. The amounts set forth in the table below are the subject of a non-binding
advisory vote of Company stockholders, as described in the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named
Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Arrangements (Proposal 2). ”
The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive
officers, and the estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may not prove correct, including
assumptions described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a
named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.
For purposes of this discussion, “single trigger” refers to benefits that arise as a result of the completion of
the merger and “double trigger” refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of
the merger and a qualifying termination.

The amounts in this column represent the “double trigger” cash severance payments to which the
named executive officers would be entitled under their respective employment agreements upon a
termination without cause or for good reason on November 30, 2021, immediately following the
effective time of the merger. The cash severance is equal to two times the sum of the executive
officer’s annual base salary and the greater of target bonus or prior 3-year average bonus (as
further described above). The amounts are generally payable as a single lump sum, unless such
amount is subject to Code Section 409A, in which case such amount shall be payable in equal
installments over a 24-month period following such qualifying termination in accordance with the
Company’s normal payroll procedures. As a condition to receiving these benefits, the named
executive officers would be required to execute and not revoke a general release of claims in favor
of the Company within 10 business days following the receipt of a copy of the release from the
Company.
The amounts in this column represent a “double trigger” guaranteed annual cash bonus payment,
payable in a single lump sum, equal to an amount that is the greater of the Actual 2021 Performance
Bonus and the Executive Minimum Bonus Amount, assuming each named executive officer incurs a
termination without cause or for good reason on November 30, 2021 immediately following the
effective time of the merger, but before December 31, 2021. Since the Actual 2021 Performance
Bonus is not currently determinable, we have assumed payout of the 2021 AIP Bonus based on (i)
the maximum Company performance achievable, or 200% of the 2021 Company target performance
opportunity and (ii) the estimated highest individual performance achievable, or 100% of the 2021
individual target performance opportunity. The bonus amount is payable in

Equity. As described in greater detail above in the sections entitled “- Treatment of Outstanding Equity
Awards” and “-Contractual Change in Control Benefits”, any restricted stock and restricted stock unit
awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the per share merger consideration
less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment as provided in the
merger agreement. Restricted stock and restricted stock units held by our named executive officers are
not entitled to any additional vesting upon a “double trigger” event.
As described in greater detail above in the sections entitled “- Treatment of Outstanding Equity
Awards” and “-Contractual Change in Control Benefits”, upon a “single trigger” event, the merger
agreement provides that any unvested performance share outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be canceled and converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount
in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of the named executive officer’s Company vested
performance shares multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration less any applicable taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Under the named executive officers’ performance
share award agreements, they will be eligible to receive accelerated vesting of 100% of their outstanding
performance shares, with 50% vesting at target through the end of the performance period and 50%
vesting based on the better of target or actual performance through the date of closing.
As described in greater detail above in the sections entitled “-Contractual Change in Control Benefits”,
upon a “double trigger” event, the named executive officer’s employment agreements provide that
where the named executive officer incurs a termination without cause or for good reason on November
30, 2021 immediately following the effective time of the merger, the named executive officer will receive
vesting on their performance shares equal to the greater of target or actual performance, each through
the closing of the merger. For purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed that the named executive
officer will incur a qualifying termination on the date of the effective time of the merger. At the time of
this filing, actual performance has already been achieved at the maximum, or 200% of target.
For purposes of this disclosure which assumes a “double trigger” event on November 30, 2021, since
actual performance has already been achieved, the table reflects accelerated vesting of the performance
shares at the better of target or actual performance through the closing, which would be 200% of target.

The following summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that are generally
applicable to stockholders of Echo. The following discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, and existing
administrative rulings and court decisions, each as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These
authorities are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Any
change could affect the validity of the following discussion. There can be no assurance that the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not challenge one or more of the tax considerations described herein. We
have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and
the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree
with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of
litigation.
This discussion is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any aspects of
U.S. state, local or non- U.S. taxes, the alternative minimum tax or any aspects of the tax on “net investment
income” imposed under Section 1411 of the Code. This discussion also does not address any special tax
rules applicable to particular stockholders such as stockholders that are financial institutions, tax-exempt
organizations, S corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entities or arrangements), insurance
companies, dealers in securities or traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of
accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, stockholders who acquired their
shares of Echo common stock pursuant to the exercise of compensatory stock options or otherwise in
connection with the performance of services, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency
other than the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States,
any person who receives consideration other than cash in the merger (or any transaction related thereto),
retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts, and stockholders who hold their shares of Echo common
stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction. The
following discussion does not address tax consequences to the persons subject to the base erosion and
anti-abuse tax. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Echo common stock as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not
address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who demand appraisal rights under Delaware
law. In addition, the following discussion does not address non-income tax consequences or the tax
consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the merger (whether
or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the merger ).
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Echo common stock
that is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or an entity treated
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise treated as such for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all
of the substantial decisions of which one or more United States persons, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code, have the authority to control, or (b) that has a valid election in effect under the applicable
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a “United States person” under the Code.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of Echo common
stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
55 TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a partnership or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
is the owner of shares of Echo common stock, the tax treatment of the partner or owner in such partnership
or other entity or arrangement will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of the
partnership or other entity or arrangement. Accordingly, partnerships and other pass-through entities that
hold shares of Echo common stock and partners or owners of such partnerships or other entities, as
applicable, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL
INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW AS OF THE DATE HEREOF.
HOLDERS OF SHARES OF ECHO COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS
AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION
AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
In General
The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
surrendered shares of Echo common stock. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Echo common
stock is generally the amount paid for such shares of Echo common stock (less the amount of any
distribution received by such holder treated as a tax-free return of capital). If a U.S. holder acquired different
blocks of shares of Echo common stock at different times or at different price, such U.S. holder must
determine gain or loss separately for each block of shares of Echo common stock exchanged for cash
pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and any such gain or loss
generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares of Echo
common stock is greater than one year as of the closing. A reduced rate on capital gain generally will apply
to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Cash consideration received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger may be subject to backup withholding
and information reporting. Backup withholding generally will apply only if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish a
correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) or otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup
withholding rules and certification requirements. Corporations are generally exempt from backup
withholding. Each U.S. Holder should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 (or substitute or successor form)
included with the letter of transmittal and certify under penalties of perjury that such number is correct and
that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. If a U.S. Holder fails to provide the correct TIN or
certification,payments received may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a 24% rate. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts so withheld can be credited against such U.S. Holder’s federal
income tax liability and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders
In General
Subject to the discussion below in “- Backup Withholding and Information Reporting”, a Non-U.S. Holder
will generally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized upon such Non-U.S.
Holder’s exchange of shares of Echo common stock pursuant to the merger agreement unless (i) such Non-
U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable year
of such disposition and certain other conditions are met, (ii) the gain is effectively connected with the
conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder and, if an applicable income tax treaty so
provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by such Non- U.S.

HSR Clearance. Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including
the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the
Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.
Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act. The merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting
period, which begins when Buyer and Echo file Premerger Notification and Report Forms under
57 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division and the FTC, unless such waiting period is earlier terminated by the
Antitrust Division and the FTC. Buyer and Echo filed their Premerger Notification and Report Forms on
September 23, 2021, in connection with the merger, and the waiting period will therefore expire at 11:59 p.m.
ET on October 25, 2021. If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the Antitrust
Division or FTC issues a request for additional information or documentary material (a “second request”)
from Buyer and Echo, the waiting period with respect to the merger would be extended until the 30th calendar
day following the date of the parties’ substantial compliance with the second request. After that time, absent
the agreement of Buyer and Echo, the acquisition can be blocked only by court order. The Antitrust Division
and the FTC may terminate the applicable waiting period at any time before its expiration.
At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust
Division or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of
the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally permit completion of the merger subject to regulatory
conditions or other remedies.
In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust
laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to
enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties
may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither
Buyer nor Echo believes that the merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a
challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would
not be successful.
Litigation Relating to the Merger
On October 12, 2021, a purported shareholder of Echo filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, captioned Stein v. Echo Global Logistics, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08399
(S.D.N.Y.). The complaint names the Company and the Company’s directors as defendants. The complaint
asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the disclosures
contained in the October 5, 2021 preliminary proxy statement issued by the Company.
Also on October 12, 2021, another purported shareholder filed a complaint in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, captioned Jones v. Echo Global Logistics, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-
08410 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint names the Company and the Company’s directors as defendants. The
complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the
disclosures contained in the October 5, 2021 preliminary proxy statement issued by the Company.
The complaints seek a variety of equitable and injunctive relief including, among other things, enjoining the
consummation of the merger, rescinding the transaction if it is consummated, and awarding the plaintiffs
costs and attorneys’ fees.
The Company believes the claims in each complaint are without merit. However, at this time it is not possible
to predict the outcome of these matters or their effects on the Company or the merger. An adverse judgment
for monetary damages could have an adverse effect on the Company. A preliminary injunction could delay or
jeopardize the completion of the merger, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could
indefinitely enjoin completion of the merger.
Echo stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the transaction, which may name Echo, members
of Echo’s Board, or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or
the lawsuits described above.",62,63

financial condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole. However, no change, effect, event, occurrence or development to the extent resulting from the

countries in which the Company or any subsidiaries conduct operations including (1) any changes
generally affecting the securities, credit or financial markets or (2) any changes in interest or exchange
rates;

a merger, sale, license, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction; or

receipt of an unsolicited acquisition proposal, contacting such person or its representatives solely to clarify
terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal pursuant to and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the merger agreement, as discussed below; (2) within three (3) business days as of the date of
the merger agreement, request in writing that each person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection its consideration of any acquisition proposal or potential acquisition proposal, promptly destroy
or return to the Company all nonpublic information previously furnished by the Company or any of its
representatives to such persons or any of such person’s representatives in accordance with the terms of
such confidentiality agreement (3) within one (1) business day as of the date of the merger agreement,

person and its representatives and (4) not waive any standstill, confidentiality or similar provision to which
the Company or any subsidiaries is a party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, Echo will not be restricted
from permitting a person to request a waiver of a “standstill” or similar obligation solely to make an
unsolicited and nonpublic acquisition proposal to the Company if Echo’s Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Receipt of Acquisition Proposals
Notwithstanding certain provisions of the merger agreement described above, prior to the time the requisite
company vote is obtained, if Echo receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal not solicited in violation
of Echo’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, and if Echo’s Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that (1) based on the information
then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, the
acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal (as defined
below), and (2) the failure to take the applicable action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law, then Echo may:
provide information (including access to the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries) to the
person making the acquisition proposal; provided that in the event the information has not
previously been made available to Buyer, Echo must promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
provide the information to Buyer, and that, prior to furnishing the information, Echo must receive from
the person making the acquisition proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms not less
restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than the terms in the confidentiality agreement between
Echo and Buyer are on Buyer; provided that, competitively sensitive information or data provided to
any such person who is a competitor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will only be provided
in a separate “clean data room” and subject to customary “clean team arrangements regarding access
to such information or data;
contact a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal solely to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof; or
engage in or participate in discussions and/or negotiations with that person regarding the unsolicited
bona fide written acquisition proposal.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means a bona fide written acquisition proposal from
any person or group, made after the date of the merger agreement that did not result from a breach of Echo’s
non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement and that would result in any person or group
becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the consolidated total assets
(including equity securities of Echo’s subsidiaries), consolidated revenues or consolidated net income or the
total voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company, that Echo’s Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, taking into account all
relevant factors (including closing certainty, certainty of financing, the legal, financial, timing and regulatory
aspects of the acquisition proposal, conditions to consummation and the identity of the person(s) making
the proposal) and the likelihood of the proposal being completed in accordance with its terms that, if
completed, would result in a transaction (1) more favorable to Echo’s stockholders from a financial point of
view than the merger and (2) that is reasonably likely to be completed, on the terms proposed “ - Change of

Echo must promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) give written notice to Buyer if Echo or any of its
subsidiaries receives (1) any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest with respect to, or that would
reasonably be expected to result in, an acquisition proposal, (2) any request by any person for non-public
information in connection with or with respect to any acquisition proposal or (3) any discussions or

setting forth in the notice the name of the person and the material terms and conditions of any such

reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of the status and terms of any
such inquiry, request for information, proposal, offer or indication of interest (including any amendments or
material changes thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations (including any change in
the Company’s intentions previously notified).
Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement
Echo’s Board has unanimously recommended that Echo stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal. The
merger agreement permits Echo’s Board to effect a change of recommendation (as defined below) only in
certain limited circumstances, as described below.
Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, Echo’s Board may not:
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify) in a manner adverse to Buyer, the company recommendation with respect to
the merger or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any acquisition proposal;
cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, acquisition agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement as defined in the merger agreement) relating to or that would reasonably be
expected to result in any acquisition proposal, an “alternative acquisition agreement”;
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend , any acquisition
proposal or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement;
fail to include the company recommendation in this proxy statement; or
fail to expressly reaffirm publicly the company recommendation within ten (10) business days
following Buyer’s written request to do so if an acquisition proposal is publicly announced or
disclosed.
The actions described in the first bullet point above is referred to in this proxy statement as a “change of
recommendation.”
However, before the requisite company vote is obtained, Echo’s Board may effect a change of
recommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, in each case if
Echo’s Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that an acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a change of
recommendation or terminating the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, (1) Echo must have
given Buyer at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to do so, (2) Echo and its
representatives must have afforded Buyer the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with Echo to enable
Buyer to propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby and (3) at the end of the notice period, Echo’s Board must have
considered in good faith the binding written offer and any other information it deems appropriate, and must
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the superior proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal if the changes proposed in the binding
offer by Buyer were to be given effect.
In addition, before the requisite company vote is obtained, Echo’s Board may effect a change of
recommendation in response to an intervening event if Echo’s Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’
68 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
fiduciary duties under applicable law. Before effecting a change of recommendation in response to an
intervening event, (1) Echo must have given Buyer at least four (4) business days’ prior written notice of its
intention to do so, (2) Echo must have afforded Buyer the opportunity to negotiate in good faith with Echo
to enable Buyer to propose in writing a binding offer to make revisions to the terms of the merger agreement
and (3) at the end of the notice period, Echo’s Board must have considered in good faith the binding written
offer and any other information it deems appropriate, and must have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a change of recommendation would still
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law if the changes proposed in the binding offer by
Buyer were to be given effect. Under the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means a material
development or material change in circumstances respect to the Company or its subsidiaries occurring after
the date of the merger agreement and prior to the time that the company requisite vote is obtained that was
not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by Echo’s Board as of or prior to September 9, 2021 (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable by Echo’s Board as of September 9, 2021; and provided that in no event will any of the following
constitute or be deemed to be an intervening event: (1) any acquisition proposal, (2) the fact in and of itself
the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after September 9, 2021
or any changes after September 9, 2021 (provided that any underlying cause for the change of meeting or
exceeding such metrics may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event
has occurred) or (3) changes in the stock price or trading volume of Echo (provided that any underlying
cause of changes in stock price or trading volume may be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether an intervening event has occurred); provided, further, that an acquisition proposal that resulted
from a breach of Echo’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement may not be the basis for an
intervening event.
In the event of any modification to the financial terms or any other material terms of any acquisition
proposal, Echo must satisfy the notice requirement described above with a new written notice to Buyer, and
comply with the negotiation requirements described above, provided that the subsequent notice period (and
any subsequent notice period thereafter) will be three (3) business days instead of five (5) business days.
The merger agreement does not prohibit Echo or Echo’s Board from taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of Echo a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the stockholders of Echo that is required by applicable law. Any
“stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act will not be deemed to be a change of recommendation; provided that any such disclosure that
has the substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to the
company recommendation will be deemed to be a change of recommendation unless Echo’s Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the company recommendation in such communication without any qualification.",71,74

Echo has agreed to take all reasonable action necessary and in accordance with the DGCL to convene a
meeting of the holders of Echo common stock (which meeting, together with any adjournment or
postponement, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “Echo stockholders’ meeting”) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments on this proxy
statement or that Echo may commence mailing this proxy statement to its stockholders, to consider and vote
upon the approval of the merger agreement and to cause such vote to be taken. Echo is permitted to
postpone or adjourn the Echo stockholders’ meeting to a later date for the following reasons: (1) with the
consent of Buyer, (2) to the extent the Company believes in good faith that such adjournment is reasonably
necessary to (a) ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the proxy statement is provided to
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time of the Company stockholders’ meeting, (b)
to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the company requisite
vote (including after commencement of an acquisition proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer), or (c)
if, as of the original date of the Company stockholders’ meeting, the Company is unable to obtain a quorum
of its stockholders at the Company stockholders’ meeting necessary to conduct business at such meeting.
However, unless consented to in writing by Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), all such adjournments or postponements will be for periods of no more than ten

Company stockholders’ meeting was originally scheduled. In addition, the record date of the Company
stockholders’ meeting will not be changed without the written consent of Buyer (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by law. Subject to Echo’s rights to effect a
change of recommendation in response to an intervening event or a superior proposal and to terminate the
merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, as described in the section entitled “ - Change of
Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement,” Echo’s Board must include the company
recommendation in this proxy statement and must take all lawful action to obtain the requisite company vote.",74,75

The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Buyer. It is anticipated that the total amount of
funds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid at the closing of the merger by Buyer and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be
approximately $1,418.5 million in cash. In connection with the financing of the merger, The Resolute Fund V,
L.P. (the “TJC Fund”) and Buyer have entered into an equity commitment letter, dated September 9, 2021 (the
“Equity Commitment Letter”), in respect of the Equity Commitment. The Equity Commitment is equal to
$758.1 million in cash (the “Equity Commitment”).
Buyer expects to finance the merger with debt financing, together with cash on hand (including proceeds
received pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter). In connection with entering into the merger agreement,
Buyer has entered into a second amended and restated commitment letter (the “Debt Commitment Letter”),
dated as of October 15, 2021, with Credit Suisse, Citi, BMO, Bank of Montreal, BNP, Citizens, KeyBank, UBS
Finance, UBS Securities, MUFG and Barings (collectively, and together with other financial institutions that

connection with applicable beneficial ownership, “know your customer” and antimoney laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act and 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230;

representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including
reasonable documented out-of-pocket attorney’s fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred in connection with the debt financing (other than arising from information provided by Echo, its

Buyer will, promptly upon written request by Echo, reimburse Echo for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs (including the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one primary

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Echo is
providing its stockholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the merger, as described in
the table entitled “Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Echo’s Named Executive Officers” under “The
Merger (Proposal 1) - Interests of Echo’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” including the
footnotes to the table and related narrative discussion beginning on page 32 of this proxy statement.
Echo’s Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Echo approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Echo’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S- K in the table in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Interests of Echo’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Echo’s Named Executive
Officers,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart
from the vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the
merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal
and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is
advisory only, it will not be binding on either Echo or Buyer. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is
approved and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the
outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Echo stockholders.
The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of Echo’s named executive officers on an
advisory basis requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to this proposal.
Echo’s Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Echo vote “FOR” the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal.

The Company’s stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal for one or more adjournments of the
Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal
to approve the merger agreement, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve
the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If this adjournment proposal is
approved, the Special Meeting could be adjourned by Echo’s Board to any date. In addition, Echo’s Board
could postpone the Special Meeting before it commences. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Echo is not
permitted to postpone or adjourn the Echo stockholders’ meeting, except to the extent advised by counsel to
be necessary to comply with law, and except that Echo may adjourn, recess or postpone, and at the request
of Buyer, it will adjourn, recess or postpone, the Echo stockholders’ meeting for a reasonable period to
solicit additional proxies, if Echo or Buyer, respectively, reasonably believes there will be insufficient shares
of Echo common stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Echo
stockholders’ meeting or to obtain the requisite company vote. Any other postponement or adjournment
would require the consent of Echo and Buyer. However, unless agreed in writing by Echo and Buyer, any
adjournments, recesses or postponements will be for periods of no more than ten business days each. Echo
may also adjourn, recess or postpone the Echo stockholders’ meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to Echo stockholders for the
amount of time required by law in advance of the Echo stockholders’ meeting. If the Special Meeting is
adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their
proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not
indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy and you indicate that you
wish to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on the
adjournment proposal, your shares of common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.
The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if Proposal 1 is approved by the requisite
number of shares of Echo common stock at the Special Meeting.
The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve
the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement
and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast
with respect to this proposal.
Echo’s Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Echo vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if a vote
on the adjournment proposal is called.

General. If you hold one or more shares of common stock, you are entitled to appraisal rights under
Delaware law and have the right to dissent from the merger and have the appraised fair value of your shares
of common stock paid to you in cash. The ultimate amount any dissenting stockholders receive in an
appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount they would have received under the
merger agreement. If you are contemplating exercising your appraisal rights, we urge you to read carefully
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, which are attached to this proxy statement as Annex C, and
consult with your legal counsel before electing or attempting to exercise these rights. The following summary
describes the steps you must take if you want to exercise your right to dissent. This summary, however, is
not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section
262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. You should read this summary and the full text of the law
carefully.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. To be eligible to exercise your appraisal rights:
prior to taking vote on the merger, you must deliver to Echo written demand for appraisal that
reasonably informs the corporation of your identity and that you intend to demand the appraisal of
your shares. A proxy or vote against the merger shall not constitute such a demand;
you must not vote in favor of or consent to the merger;
you must provide to Echo, not later than the 20th day after Echo sends you notice that the merger
was completed, your written demand for payment that reasonably informs Echo of your identity and
that you intend to demand the appraisal of your shares;
you must continuously hold your shares of common stock from the record date through the
completion of the merger.
If you intend to dissent from the merger, you must send written notice (by mail, hand-delivery, courier or
electronic transmission), addressed to Zach Jecklin, to:
Echo Global Logistics, Inc. 
600 West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725 
Chicago, IL 60654 
Attention: Zach Jecklin 
Email: zjecklin@echo.com
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will lose your appraisal
rights from the merger and will instead receive the per share merger consideration. If you comply with these
conditions set forth above and the merger is completed, Echo will send you a written notice advising you
that the merger has been completed. The Company must deliver this notice to you within 10 days after the
merger is completed.
Your written demand and any notices to Echo must be sent (by mail, hand-delivery, courier or electronic
transmission), addressed to Zach Jecklin, to:
Echo Global Logistics, Inc. 
600 West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725 
Chicago, IL 60654 
Attention: Zach Jecklin 
Email: zjecklin@echo.com
Within 120 days of the merger, any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may file a petition in the Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock. Upon written request by such stockholder,
such stockholder shall be entitled to receive from Echo a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the merger and the aggregate number of holders of such shares.
Within 20 days of the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, Echo shall file in the office of the Register
in Chancery a verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
84 TABLE OF CONTENTS
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by Echo. The Register in Chancery shall give notice for a hearing if ordered by the Court.
At the hearing, the Court shall determine who is entitled to appraisal rights, appraise the shares, determining
their fair value with a fair rate of interest, and direct the payment. If you have made a written demand on Echo
for payment of the fair value of your shares of common stock, you will not thereafter be entitled to vote or
receive a payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock.

In accordance with Rule 14a-3(e)(1) under the Exchange Act, one proxy statement will be delivered to two or
more stockholders who share an address, unless Echo has received contrary instructions from one or more
of the stockholders. Each stockholder will receive a separate proxy card. The Company will deliver promptly
upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to
which a single copy of the proxy statement was delivered. Requests for additional copies of the proxy
statement should be directed to Echo at Echo Global Logistics, Inc., 600 West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725,
Chicago, IL 60654, Attention: Investor Relations Department or by calling 800-354-7993. In addition,

Board of Directors 
Echo Global Logistics, Inc. 
600 West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725 
Chicago, Illinois 60654
Members of the Board:
We understand that Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (the “Company”), Einstein MidCo, LLC (the “Buyer”) and
Einstein Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition Sub”), propose to enter
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated as of September 9, 2021
(the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Acquisition
Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares held in treasury or held by the Buyer or
Acquisition Sub or as to which dissenters’ rights have been perfected (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
will be converted into the right to receive $48.25 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and
conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares or any of
the Buyer’s affiliates).
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of the Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
the Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the
Company with senior executives of the Company;
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the
Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the
Company and their securities;
Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and
the Buyer and their financial and legal advisors;
Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the debt commitment letter from certain lenders dated as of
September 7, 2021 and the draft equity commitment letter from The Resolute Fund V, L.P.
substantially in the form of the draft dated as of September 9, 2021 (together, the “Commitment
Letters”), and the limited guaranty from The Resolute Fund V, L.P. to the Company substantially in
the form of the draft dated as of September 9, 2021; and
Performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and
formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that
they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
B-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In
addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in
the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among
other things, that the Buyer will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment
Letters and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof
furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory
advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the
assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory
matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to
any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We
do not express any view on, and this opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith. We
have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have
we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial,
economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion
does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction,
or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this
transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the
closing of the Merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley will receive a fee upon rendering of this opinion. In the
two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financing services for the Buyer and certain of its
affiliates and expect to receive fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to
provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and the Company and their respective
affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment
management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities
underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan
Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that
invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect
transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of
the Buyer, the Company or their affiliates, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be
involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates,
directors or officers, including individuals working with the Company in connection with this transaction,
may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by the Buyer or
its affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of
Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written
consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is
required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such
inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation
as to how the shareholders of the Company should vote at the shareholders’ meeting to be held in
connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement

is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as paying agent hereunder (and pursuant to an agreement in

benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) at the Effective Time, a cash amount in
immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 2.1(a) (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent, provided that such investments shall be limited to direct short-term obligations
of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund,

To the extent that there are losses with respect to any such investments or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
any reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment under Section 2.1(a), Parent shall, or shall

Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) business days), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or electronically provide to each
holder of record, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Shares (other than holders
of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent in accordance with the
terms of such duly executed letter of transmittal the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal
to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.
(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be

the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Article II.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) as of the Effective Time who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder
of Shares for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Person” shall mean any

destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,

The Company Board has (A) made the Company Recommendation, (B) directed that this
Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their approval at a stockholders’
meeting duly called and held for such purpose and (C) received the opinion of its financial
advisor to the effect that the consideration to be received by the holders of the Shares in

Board and may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

Adverse Change or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of

its respective date, and, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, each
Company Report complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Report. As of its
respective date, and, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, no Company
Report contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.
Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports

respects, the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and year-
end adjustments) and in each case were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), except as may be noted therein. There are no
unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any “off-balance sheet” arrangements of
the type required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC.
The Company maintains a system of “internal control over financial reporting”  (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. No significant deficiency, material weakness or fraud
that involves management or other employees was identified in management’s assessment
of internal controls as of December 31, 2020. The Company maintains “disclosure controls
and procedures”  (as defined by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information required
to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company’s filings with the SEC.

the “Representatives”). Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.1 (as
modified by the Company Reports filed with the SEC or the Company Disclosure Letter, as supplemented or
amended), the Company hereby disclaims all liability and responsibility for any representation, warranty,
projection, forecast, statement or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to

anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company makes no representations or warranties
to Parent or Merger Sub regarding any projections or the future or probable profitability, success, business,

3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. Except as set forth in the corresponding
sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent prior to entering into
this Agreement (the “Parent Disclosure Letter”  (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face), Parent and Merger Sub
jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that:
(a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or similar entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so organized, qualified or in such good standing, or to have such power or authority, are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the charter and by-
laws or comparable governing documents of Parent and Merger Sub, each as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.
(b) Corporate Authority. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve or adopt this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute
and deliver this Agreement and, subject only to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which adoption and approval by Parent will occur immediately following
execution of this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
(subject to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant
to the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and
is a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger
Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(i) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
HSR Act, any other applicable antitrust laws and any other antitrust, competition or similar
Laws of any foreign jurisdiction, and (B) under the Exchange Act (collectively, clauses (A)
through (B), the “Parent Approvals”), no notices, reports or other filings are required to be
made by Parent and Merger Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits or authorizations required to be obtained by Parent and Merger Sub from, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Assuming compliance with the matters referenced in Section 3.2(c)(i) and receipt of the
Parent Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or default under, the charter or by-laws or comparable governing documents of
Parent or Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of any of Parent’s
Subsidiaries (other than Merger Sub), (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a
breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the creation
or acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, (C) a violation of any Laws to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation,
termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.
(d) Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits,
claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin or would be reasonably likely to have the effect
of preventing, making illegal or otherwise interfering with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
The term “Knowledge” when used in this Agreement with respect to Parent shall mean the actual knowledge
of those persons set forth in Section 3.2(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter without obligation of any further
review or inquiry, and does not include information of which they may be deemed to have constructive
knowledge only.
(e) Financing.
Section 3.2(e)(i)(A) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true, accurate and complete
copies of an executed commitment letter, together with all schedules and exhibits thereto,
from the Persons named therein (collectively, the “Lenders”) (together with the associated
fee letter, the “Debt Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to lend the amount set forth therein to
Parent or Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the “Debt Financing”). Section 3.2(e)(i)(B) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets
forth true, accurate and complete copies of the executed commitment letter (the “Equity
Commitment Letter”) and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, collectively, the
“Commitment Letters” or the “Financing Commitments”) between Parent and the investors
named therein (the “Investors”) pursuant to which the Investors have committed to invest
the amounts set forth therein (the “Equity Financing”) and together with the Debt
Financing, the “Financing”); provided that the provisions in any copy of the fee letter for
the Debt Financing delivered pursuant hereto related to fees, pricing, market flex provisions,
customary threshold amounts and any other provisions as reasonably required by the
Lenders may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect
the aggregate

(ii) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
principal amount committed thereunder. The Equity Commitment Letters provides that (A)
the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof and (B) Parent and the Investors
have waived any defenses to the enforceability of such third party beneficiary rights.
As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and
have not been withdrawn, waived or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, as of
the date of this Agreement, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub
and the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Except as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments, other than the Financing Commitments, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no written agreements or side letters relating to the conditionality, funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing, and the Financing
Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent or Merger Sub (as applicable) on the
terms therein. No event has occurred as of the date of this Agreement which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i) constitute a default or breach of Parent or
Merger Sub, or to the Knowledge of Parent, of any other party thereto, under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments; or (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, otherwise result
in or would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Financing not being
available by the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Investors nor any
Lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any of the Financing
Commitments or not to provide the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term
or condition of closing to be satisfied by it with respect to the Financing Commitments or
that the full amount of the Financing will not be available as of the Closing. Parent has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments (or
any related fee letter or engagement letter) to be paid as of the date of this Agreement. None
of the Financing Commitments (or any related fee letter or engagement letter) contains any
commitment fee or other fee payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
prior to Closing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and
Section 5.2, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing
required to be provided by Parent to pay the aggregate Merger consideration contemplated
by this Agreement (including the payment by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2), all costs, fees
and expenses and all other amounts (including refinancing or repayment of any debt)
required to be paid by Parent on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the “Required Financing Amount”). As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been withdrawn and, assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, Parent does not know
of any facts or circumstances that would result in or would reasonably be expected to result
in any of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied or any
portion of the Financing not being available. Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees
that, except as set forth in Section 7.6, its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereunder is not
subject to any condition or contingency with respect to financing.
(f) Capitalization of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 100 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date
hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
A-23 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(g) Brokers and Finders. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement, except that Parent has employed
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as its financial advisor.
(h) Solvency. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger,
or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payment of all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and payment of all
related fees and expenses and (ii) the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent”
when used with respect any Person means that, immediately following the Effective Time, (i)(A) the fair value
of the assets of such Person will exceed the amount of all liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of such Person,
and (B) the amount of the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of such time, exceed the probable
value of all of its debts and liabilities on a consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured, (ii) the Person will not have, as of such time, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii) the Person will be able
to pay its Debts as they become absolute and mature. The term “Solvency” shall have its correlative
meaning. For purposes of the definition of “Solvent”: (A) ”Debt” means liability on a Claim; and (B) ”Claim”
means any right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured.
“Present Fair Salable Value” means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Person
(including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under
present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises. For purposes of this definition, “not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged”
and “able to pay its Debts as they become absolute and mature” means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet
its obligations as they become due. No transfer is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
(i) Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Other than as a result of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has been, an
“interested stockholder”  (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company. None of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is used under Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), or has at any time during the last three (3) years beneficially owned,
any Shares or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Shares or
other securities of, or any economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.
(j) Proxy Statement. None of the information to be supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Representative of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, if any, will, at the time such
document is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties in this
Section 5.05 do not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement based upon information supplied by the Company or any of its Representatives in writing
specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.
(k) Stockholder and Management Arrangements. As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub nor any
of their Affiliates has entered into any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed or
agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understanding (whether or not binding)
with any stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(in their capacities as such) (i) relating to (A) this Agreement; (B) the Company or (C) the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment)
from and after the Effective Time; or (ii) pursuant to which (A) any holder of shares of

Proposal after the date of this Agreement that is not preceded by a breach of Section 4.2, (i) provide

(A) the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
Financial Advisor, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (B) the Company Board has determined in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”
means an executed confidentiality agreement with terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to and
not less restrictive in any material respect than in the Confidentiality Agreement which agreement shall not
restrict the Company from complying with its obligations under this Agreement.
(d) Except as provided in Sections 4.2(e) and 4.2(g), the Company Board shall not (i) withhold, withdraw,

any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar

reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an “Alternative Acquisition
Agreement”), (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (iv) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (v) fail to expressly reaffirm publicly the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following Parent’s written request to do so if an Acquisition

Proposal by the Company after the date of this Agreement that is not preceded by a breach of Section 4.2, if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial
Advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (i) make a
Change of Recommendation and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement) with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided that prior to taking any such
action, (x) the Company has given Parent five (5) Business Days’ notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall state that it has received a Superior Proposal, include the material terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal, the consideration offered therein, the identity of the Person or group (as defined in or
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making the Superior Proposal and, a copy of the definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all related material documentation relating to such Superior Proposal
and, subject to customary redactions (to the extent provided to the Company in redacted form), a copy of
any financing commitments relating thereto), (y) the Company and its Representatives has negotiated in
good faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) with Parent during such notice period to enable Parent
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby such that it
would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the Company Board
would no longer determine that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3(a), as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board
shall have determined, in good faith, any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and Financial Advisor, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect and that the failure
to make such Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3(a),
as applicable, would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(provided further that any material amendment to the financial terms of the Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice and shall require the Company to further comply with the requirements of the proviso of this
Section 4.2(d), except that the notice period shall be three (3) Business Days, not five (5) Business Days).
(f) The Company agrees that it will promptly, and in any event within twenty-four hours, notify Parent in
writing if any inquiries, proposals, offers or indications of interest with respect to, or that would reasonably
be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of such Person
and the material terms and conditions thereof and a copy of any such inquiry, proposal or offer or indication
of interest and any draft agreement or other material documents provided in connection therewith.
Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms
of any such inquiry, request for information, proposal, offer or indication of interest (including by notifying
Parent in writing of any amendments or material changes to the terms thereto within twenty-four hours) and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company’s intentions as
previously notified.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the
Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation for a
reason unrelated to a Superior Proposal if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, (I) an Intervening Event occurred and (II) the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law as a result of the Intervening
Event; provided that prior to taking any such action, (x) the Company has given Parent four (4) Business
Days’ notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonably detailed description of such circumstances
giving rise to such Intervening Event that serves as the basis of the Change of Recommendation, (y) the
Company has negotiated in good faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) with Parent during such
notice period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby such that it would obviate the need for making such Change of Recommendation as the
failure to do so would no longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and (z) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby proposed in writing by
Parent and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside legal

Executive for good reason (as defined in such Senior Executive’s employment agreement with the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof or, if no such employment agreement exists, as determined
in good faith by the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation) on or after the Effective Time and
before December 31, 2021, such Senior Executive shall be entitled to the bonus amount determined in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 4.9(d) that the Senior Executive would have been entitled

one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of all participants’ target 2021 annual bonuses under the Corporate
Bonus Plan. The 2021 annual bonuses due to each Corporate Bonus Plan participant under this Section 4.9(e)
and the Corporate Bonus Plan shall be paid as soon as practicable following the completion of the
Company’s audit for 2021 and, in any event, no later than March 15, 2022. Notwithstanding the continued

the Company or its Subsidiaries without cause (as determined in good faith by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation) on or after the Effective Time and before the payment date for the 2021 annual bonus, such
participant shall remain entitled to his or her 2021 annual bonus under the Corporate Bonus Plan in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 4.9(e) as if such participant remained employed with

or around the same time as annual bonuses are paid to other participants in the Corporate Bonus Plan.

Corporation shall have no obligations under Section 4.9(a) and (b), including in respect of providing any
severance or termination benefits).

to the Financing on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions) contained in the Commitment
Letters so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the
Closing Date (which definitive financing agreements shall not (1) reduce the amounts to be funded under the

provide to the Company copies of all documents (including all fee letters and engagement letters but
excluding provisions thereof related to fees, pricing, market flex provisions, customary threshold amounts
and any other provisions as reasonably required by the Lenders, which may be redacted so long as no
redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate principal amount committed thereunder)
relating to the Financing and shall keep the Company reasonably informed of material developments in
respect of the financing process relating thereto.
(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any
material breach or material default (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or material default) by any party to any
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements entered into pursuant thereto related to the Financing of which
Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt or delivery of any written notice or other communication, in each
case from any Person with respect to any actual or potential material breach, material default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Financing or (iii) if
at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of

Financing Commitments. Parent shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence.
(c) Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not agree to any
amendment, modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitments to the extent such
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would (i) reduce the amounts to be funded under the Equity
Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing (including by

Commitment Letter, including the related “flex provisions” of the fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment

(d) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under Section
4.15(a), any of the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter expire or are terminated prior to the
Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and subject to the conditions (including any “flex” provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability, expiration or termination and the
reasons therefor, (ii) as promptly as practicable use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for alternative debt
financing (the “Alternative Financing”) (which alternative debt financing shall be in an amount sufficient,
when added with the Equity Financing, to pay the Required Financing Amount at Closing and shall not
include any conditions that are more onerous than or in addition to the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement), to be consummated no later than the day on
which the Closing shall occur pursuant to Section 1.2, (iii) provide to the Company copies of all documents

the process of obtaining any alternative financing. In the event any alternative financing is obtained, any
reference herein (other than in connection with the making of the representations and warranties in Section
3.2(e) on the original signing date of this Agreement) to (x) ”Financing” or “Debt Financing” shall include
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified or replaced in compliance with
this Section 4.15, and (y) ”Financing Commitments,” “Commitment Letters” or “Debt Commitment Letter”
shall include the Debt Commitment Letter except to the extent superseded in its entirety by an alternative
financing at the time in question and the definitive agreements relating to any alternative financing to replace
the Debt Financing, entered into in compliance with this Section 4.15 to the extent then in effect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.15(a) through Section 4.15(d), it is understood and
agreed that in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent and its Affiliates be deemed or construed to
require Parent or any of its Affiliates to pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including market flex provisions set forth therein) as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or agree to any market flex provision materially less favorable to the Buyer than the market flex
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement (in either
case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). None of such Sections
4.15(a) through Section 4.15(d) shall require Parent or its Affiliates to provide, or cause to be provided, any
information or take, or cause to be taken, any action to the extent it would result in a material violation of
material, applicable Law, or provide any information to any Person that would result in (x) a violation of any
confidentiality obligation contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or (y) loss of any attorney-client
privilege.
(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective non-legal Representatives to, at Parent’s sole cost and expense,

Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto
(or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); provided, however, and notwithstanding anything in the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall impair the rights of the
Company, if any, to obtain the relief set forth in Section 7.6 prior to any termination of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, “willful breach” means a material breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken by the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would be
reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.
(b) In the event that:
(A) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal (substituting 50% for the 15%
threshold set forth in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal”) (a “Company Qualifying
Transaction”) shall have been publicly made, proposed or disclosed or otherwise becomes
publicly known prior to such termination (or, in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 6.2(b), prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof)), (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 6.2(a) (Outside Date) or 6.2(b) (Company Requisite Vote not
Obtained) or by Parent pursuant to Section 6.4(a) (Company Breach), and (C) at any time on
or prior to the 12-month anniversary of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement regarding a Company Qualifying Transaction that is subsequently
completed, a tender offer that constitutes a Company Qualifying Transaction is completed
or the Company otherwise completes a Company Qualifying Transaction (whether or not it
is the same such transaction that became publicly known);
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 6.3(a) (Termination for
Superior Proposal); or
this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section 6.4(b) (Change of
Recommendation).
then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee. Any Company Termination Fee due under
this Section 6.5(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account provided in
writing by Parent to the Company (A) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (i) above, within three (3)
business days of the consummation of the Company Qualifying Transaction, (B) in the case of termination
pursuant to clause (ii) above, as set forth in Section 6.3(a) (i.e., concurrently with such termination) or (C) in
the case of a termination pursuant to clause (iii) above, within three (3) business days of such termination.
For purposes of this Agreement, “Company Termination Fee” means thirty-nine million five hundred and
eighty-eight thousand dollars ($39,588,000.00). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of themselves and the
Parent Non-Recourse Parties) that in the event that Parent is entitled to receive the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 6.5(b), the right of Parent to receive such amount shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy for, and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of, any termination of
this Agreement for Parent, Guarantor, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources, and it and their respective
Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect equityholders, general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, directors,
officers, employees, agents or other Representatives (including legal counsel, accountants and financial
advisors), Affiliates or assignees (the “Parent Non-Recourse Parties”), regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such termination. Upon payment of such amount, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or any of their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (the “Company Non-Recourse Parties”), shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parent shall not need to prove damages to
receive the Company Termination Fee when it is payable under this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably
waives any right to challenge the amount of actual damages represented by the Company Termination Fee. In
no event shall Parent be entitled to the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 6.3(b) or Section
6.3(c), then Parent (or the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee solely to the extent provided therein) shall
pay the Parent Termination Fee and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect

of such termination. Any Parent Termination Fee due under this Section 6.5(c) shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account provided in writing by the Company to Parent within three (3)
business days of the termination. For purposes of this Agreement, “Parent Termination Fee” means
seventy-nine million one hundred and seventy-six thousand dollars ($79,176,000.00). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and subject to the Company’s specific performance
rights expressly set forth in Section 7.6, except for the payment obligations set forth in Section 4.15(e) and
(f), the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement and the Company’s right to receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee (if payable in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement) and
enforce the Guaranty (in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Guaranty) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or the Financing Sources for,
and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Non-Recourse Parties) shall be deemed to have
waived all other remedies (including equitable remedies) with respect to, any losses, damages, liabilities,
taxes, claims, fines, judgments, costs and expenses suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement,
the failure of the Closing to occur or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, under the Equity
Commitment Letter or otherwise. Except as specified in the immediately preceding sentence, following the
termination of this Agreement, (A) none of Parent or any Parent Non-Recourse Parties shall have any liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and therein,
(B) neither the Company nor any Company Non-Recourse Party shall be entitled to bring, and the Company
shall cause all the Company Non-Recourse Parties not to bring, and shall in no event support, facilitate,
encourage or take any action, suit or other legal proceeding of any nature (under any legal theory, whether
sounding in law (whether for breach of contract, in tort or otherwise) or in equity) against the Parent Non-
Recourse Parties with respect to, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the termination of this
Agreement, the failure of the Closing to occur or for a breach (including any willful breach) or failure to
perform hereunder, under the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) and the Company shall cause any such action, suit or other legal
proceeding pending as of any termination of this Agreement to be dismissed with prejudice as promptly as
practicable after such termination, and (C) under no circumstances will the Company Non-Recourse Parties
be entitled to monetary remedies for any losses, damages, liabilities, taxes, claims, fines, judgments, costs
and expenses suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in the
Debt Commitment Letter to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder or
for any representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith. In no event
shall the Company be entitled to the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 6.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 6.5(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay
any amounts due pursuant to Section 6.5(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand, commences a legal proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount set forth in Section 6.5(b) or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company shall
pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) in connection with such legal proceeding, together with interest on such amount
or portion thereof at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such
payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable
(the amounts referred to in the foregoing, the “Collection Costs”; provided, that in no event shall the
Collection Costs exceed $10,000,000).

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement,
and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that,
except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article VI, the parties (on behalf of
themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in Section 7.9) shall, subject Section
7.6(b), be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof. The parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 7.6(b), such relief shall
include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, if each of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 have
been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing and the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to Section 1.2). The parties further agree that (a) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
Section 7.6, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief, at law or in equity,
that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated (other than the respective Termination Fee) or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this Section 7.6 are not available or otherwise are not granted and (b) nothing contained in
this Section 7.6 shall require any party to institute any action or proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 7.6 before exercising any termination
right under Article VI (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
action or proceeding pursuant to this Section 7.6 or anything contained in this Section 7.6 restrict or limit
any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VI or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each of the parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees
that it hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with
such relief.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, including Section 7.6(a), the right
of the Company to seek specific performance of Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing shall only be available if: (i) all conditions

to Closing set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 have been satisfied (other than any condition that by its
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing but each of which would be satisfied if the Closing were to

has been funded in accordance with its terms or will be funded in accordance with its terms at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that
all conditions to Closing set forth in Section 5.3 have been satisfied (or waived) and if specific performance

Board of Directors 
Echo Global Logistics, Inc. 
600 West Chicago Avenue, Suite 725 
Chicago, Illinois 60654
Members of the Board:
We understand that Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (the “Company”), Einstein MidCo, LLC (the “Buyer”) and
Einstein Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition Sub”), propose to enter
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated as of September 9, 2021
(the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Acquisition
Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares held in treasury or held by the Buyer or
Acquisition Sub or as to which dissenters’ rights have been perfected (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
will be converted into the right to receive $48.25 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and
conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares or any of
the Buyer’s affiliates).
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of the Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
the Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the
Company with senior executives of the Company;
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the
Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the
