If the merger is not approved by TravelCenters stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, TravelCenters stockholders will not receive the per share merger consideration (defined below)
for the shares of TravelCenters common stock that they hold. Instead, TravelCenters will remain a public
company, shares of TravelCenters common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act,
and we will continue to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under specified
circumstances, TravelCenters may be required to pay BP a termination fee upon the termination of the merger
agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement - Termination
Fee.” Under specified circumstances, BP may be required to pay TravelCenters a reverse termination fee
upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination of
the Merger Agreement - Reverse Termination Fee.”",10,10

Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of TravelCenters common stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of TravelCenters common stock owned by (i) TravelCenters or
(ii) BP, Merger Subsidiary or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of BP (clause (i) and (ii) collectively being
referred to herein as excluded shares)) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $86.00 in
cash, without interest, which amount we refer to as the per share merger consideration, and, without any
action by the holders of such shares of TravelCenters common stock, such shares of TravelCenters common
stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist,
and each share will thereafter represent only the right to receive the per share merger consideration to be
paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. As described further in “The Merger
Agreement -  Surrender and Payment Procedures” beginning on page 61, immediately after the Effective
Time, BP will deposit or cause to be deposited, with the paying agent, for the benefit of the holders of
TravelCenters common stock, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five business days after the Effective Time), BP
will send, or cause the paying agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of TravelCenters common
stock at the Effective Time other than excluded shares, a letter of transmittal (in a form that was reasonably
acceptable to TravelCenters prior to the Effective Time) and instructions (which will specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (as
defined in the merger agreement) or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)
to the paying agent) for use in such exchange.
At the Effective Time, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration under the
terms of the merger agreement, but you no longer will have any rights as a TravelCenters stockholder as a
result of the merger.",10,10

on page 36, has (1) determined and declared that the terms of the merger agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements (as defined in the merger agreement), the merger and the other transactions contemplated

vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive officers in

In connection with the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, on February 15, 2023, Citi
delivered an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion dated February 15,
2023, to the TravelCenters Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the
written opinion, of the $86.00 in cash per outstanding share of TravelCenters common stock to be received
by the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive
business management services from RMR, including SVC, or any of their respective affiliates) of outstanding
shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of Citi’s written
opinion dated February 15, 2023, which describes the assumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other
matters considered on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of Citi’s opinion set forth in the
section entitled “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of Citi’s opinion. Citi’s opinion, the issuance of which was authorized by Citi’s fairness
opinion committee, was provided for the information of the TravelCenters Board (in its capacity as such) in its
evaluation of the proposed merger and was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the
opinion, of the $86.00 in cash per share of TravelCenters common stock to be received by the holders (other than (i)
BP and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive business management services from RMR,
including SVC, or any of their respective affiliates) of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to
the merger agreement. Citi’s opinion does not address any other aspects or implications of the transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how such
shareholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed merger. Citi’s opinion does not address
TravelCenters’s underlying business decision to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to
any alternative business strategies that might exist for TravelCenters or the effect of any other transaction in which
TravelCenters might engage. Pursuant to an engagement letter between TravelCenters and Citi, TravelCenters
has agreed to pay Citi an aggregate fee of approximately $20 million, $2 million of which became payable
upon Citi’s delivery of the opinion described in the section entitled “The Merger - Opinion of Citigroup
Global Markets Inc.” and the remainder of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger.

When considering the recommendation of the TravelCenters Board that you vote to approve the
proposal to approve the merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that may be deemed to be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a
stockholder. The TravelCenters Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in
evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and
the merger and in recommending that the merger be approved by TravelCenters stockholders. As described
in more detail below, these interests may include, for one or more of our directors and executive officers:
Accelerated vesting of TravelCenters equity awards in connection with the merger, and the settlement
of such awards in exchange for cash in the amounts as described in this proxy statement; and
Payment of change in control, separation or retention bonuses.
4 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
If the proposal to approve the merger is approved by our stockholders and the merger occurs, under the
terms of the merger agreement, any TravelCenters common stock held by our directors and executive officers
will be treated in the same manner as issued and outstanding TravelCenters common stock held by all other
TravelCenters stockholders entitled to receive the per share merger consideration.

Officers of TravelCenters” for a more detailed discussion of the interests of TravelCenters’s directors and

Each share of TravelCenters common stock that is subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions under
any TravelCenters stock plan (a “TravelCenters restricted share”) that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and become free of such restrictions as of the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each such TravelCenters restricted share will be converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to (i) the number of shares of TravelCenters common stock subject to
each restricted share award, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration of $86.00. TravelCenters
restricted shares will be treated like all other shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the merger,
as described under “The Merger - Certain Effects of the Merger on TravelCenters.” Payments in respect of
TravelCenters equity awards will be reduced by applicable tax withholding.",13,13

The receipt of cash for shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined
under “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for a U.S.
holder’s shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger generally will result in the
recognition of gain or loss by such U.S. holder in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash that such U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger (determined before the deduction of
any applicable withholding or transfer taxes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
TravelCenters common stock exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding taxes may also
apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the merger, unless such U.S. holder complies with certification
procedures under the backup withholding rules. A Non-U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger - Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax with respect to the exchange of shares of TravelCenters common stock for cash pursuant to the merger
unless such Non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or unless the Company is, or was
during the relevant period, a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and certain other conditions are met. However, a Non-U.S. holder may be subject to backup
withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise
establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax. Stockholders should refer to the discussion in
the section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and
consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in
light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or
foreign taxing jurisdiction.",13,13

The merger agreement generally requires each party to make appropriate filings required by antitrust
laws, to use its reasonable best efforts to comply with requests under applicable antitrust laws for additional
information from any governmental authority and to cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing, provided, that in no event will TravelCenters or any of its affiliates agree to any term, condition,
obligation, liability, requirement, limitation, qualification, remedy, commitment, sanction or other action
5 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
in connection with the expiration of any such waiting period or obtaining of any such consent, registration,
approval, permit or authorization that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement without the prior written consent of BP. The merger cannot be
completed until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) has expired and any agreement between a party to the merger agreement
and a governmental authority not to consummate the merger has expired or been terminated, and all other
approvals under antitrust law have been received. Both TravelCenters and BP filed notifications of the
merger with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice under the HSR Act on March 9,
2023. Accordingly, the initial waiting period will expire on April 10, 2023.
In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) BP will take any and all action necessary, including (A) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories
of assets or businesses of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries, (B) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries, (C)
terminating any venture or other arrangement, (D) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations
of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries or (E) effectuating any other change or restructuring
of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries or restricting TravelCenters or BP or their respective
Subsidiaries’ ability to operate their respective businesses (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States, any other
competition authority of any jurisdiction or any other governmental authority (collectively, “Antitrust
Authority”) in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to
TravelCenters or BP or its or their businesses or assets by consenting to such action by TravelCenters and,
provided, that, any such action may, at the discretion of TravelCenters, be conditioned upon consummation
of the merger) (each, a “Divestiture Action”) and to ensure that no governmental authority enters any order,
decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule,
regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the merger or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or
otherwise approve the consummation of the merger, fails to do so by the end date (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement”); and (ii) neither BP nor its
affiliates will acquire any interest in any person that primarily derives revenues from lines of business in the
United States similar to TravelCenters’s travel centers, if such action would make it materially more likely that
there would arise any impediments under any antitrust law that may be asserted by any governmental
authority to the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby as soon as reasonably practicable.
In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the merger as violative of any
antitrust law, BP will take all action necessary, including any Divestiture Action to avoid or resolve such
action. In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement unlawful or that
would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, BP will take as reasonably promptly as practicable any and all steps
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to
the end date. TravelCenters will cooperate with BP and will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist BP
in resisting and reducing any Divestiture Action.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or anything contrary in the merger agreement, nothing in the
merger agreement will require BP to (1) take any Divestiture Action if doing so would result in BP,
TravelCenters or their respective subsidiaries divesting (by way of sale, separation or otherwise) any
business or assets if the aggregate annual revenues generated from such businesses or assets in 2022
exceed $175 million or (2) otherwise take or commit to take any Divestiture Actions that together with actions
in clause (1) would be reasonably likely to result in a loss of aggregate annual revenues (expressed as a
positive number) together with an increase in aggregate annual expenses of BP and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, in excess of $175 million.",13,14

The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions
regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not
address all questions that may be important to a TravelCenters stockholder. We encourage you to read
carefully the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this
proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. You

What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on TravelCenters?
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of TravelCenters by BP pursuant to the merger agreement. If
the proposal to approve the merger is approved by TravelCenters stockholders and the other closing
conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with
and into TravelCenters, with TravelCenters surviving the merger. As a result of the merger,
TravelCenters will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BP and will no longer be a publicly
held company, and you, as a holder of shares of TravelCenters common stock, will no longer have any
interest in the future earnings or growth of TravelCenters. In addition, following the merger, shares of
TravelCenters common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act,
and TravelCenters will no longer file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on account of shares of TravelCenters common stock.
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
Upon completion of the merger, for each share of TravelCenters common stock that you own, you will
be entitled to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding or transfer taxes.
Please do NOT return your share certificate(s) with your proxy.
How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of shares of TravelCenters common
stock on the last trading day prior to announcement of the execution of the merger agreement?
The per share merger consideration represents an approximately 74% premium to TravelCenters’s
closing share price on February 15, 2023, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the
execution of the merger agreement.
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
You are being asked to consider and vote on proposals (i) to approve the merger, (ii) to approve a
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for
TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and (iii) to approve a proposal
to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of the special
meeting, there are an insufficient number of votes in favor of approving the merger.
How does the TravelCenters Board recommend that I vote?
The TravelCenters Board recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the
merger, “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the
merger, and “FOR” approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are an insufficient number of votes in favor
of approving the merger.
When do you expect the merger to be completed?

necessary closing conditions, we currently expect the closing of the merger to occur by mid-year 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger is not approved by TravelCenters stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, TravelCenters stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of TravelCenters
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, TravelCenters will remain an independent public
company and shares of TravelCenters common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq.
Under specified circumstances, TravelCenters may be required to pay BP a termination fee upon the
termination of the merger agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the
Merger Agreement - Termination Fee” beginning on page 82. Under specified circumstances, BP may be
required to pay TravelCenters a reverse termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement,
as described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement - Reverse
Termination Fee” beginning on page 82.
What conditions must be satisfied to complete the merger?
The respective obligations of TravelCenters, BP and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the merger are
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) receipt by
the Company of the Company stockholder approval, (ii) that there is no temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction in
effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, (iii) the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act and any
agreement between a party to the merger agreement and a governmental authority not to consummate
the merger, and receipt of and all other approvals under antitrust laws, (iv) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement (subject to specified materiality
qualifiers), (v) compliance with the covenants and obligations under the merger agreement in all material
respects, (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the Company, and (vii) the
execution, release and delivery of the Consent and Amendment Agreement.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger?
The receipt of cash for shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined
under “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page
54) in exchange for such U.S. holder’s shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger
generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss by such U.S. holder in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger (determined before
the deduction of any applicable withholding or transfer taxes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the shares of TravelCenters common stock exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. Backup
withholding taxes may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the merger, unless such U.S.
holder complies with certification procedures under the backup withholding rules. A Non-U.S. holder (as
defined under “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning
on page 54) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of
shares of TravelCenters common stock for cash pursuant to the merger unless such Non-U.S. holder has
certain connections to the United States or unless the Company is, or was during the relevant period, a
“United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and certain other
conditions are met. However, a Non-U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the
Non-U.S. holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid
exemption from backup withholding tax.
Stockholders should refer to the discussion in the section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 54 and consult their own tax advisors
concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing
jurisdiction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?
You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form because you owned
shares of TravelCenters common stock as of the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the special meeting. This proxy statement describes matters on which we urge you to
vote and is intended to assist you in deciding how to vote your shares of TravelCenters common stock
with respect to such matters.
When and where is the special meeting?
The special meeting of TravelCenters stockholders will be held virtually on Wednesday, May 10, 2023 at
9:30 a.m., Eastern time. Any reference herein to attending the special meeting, including any reference to
“virtual” or “in person” attendance, means attending by remote communication via live webcast on the
Internet. The special meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders conducted exclusively
by webcast. No physical meeting will be held. You may participate in the special meeting via Internet
webcast by visiting the following website and following the registration and participation instructions
contained therein: https://www.viewproxy.com/TravelCentersofAmerica/2023. Please have the control
number located on your proxy card available.
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
Under the Exchange Act and SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with
respect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger compensation.
What will happen if TravelCenters’s stockholders do not approve the executive compensation?
Approval of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote is an
advisory vote and will not be binding on TravelCenters or the surviving corporation in the merger.
Because the merger-related compensation to be paid to the named executive officers in connection with
the merger is based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers and the merger
agreement, such compensation may be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the
merger is approved (subject only to the contractual obligations applicable thereto).
What vote is required for TravelCenters’s stockholders to approve the proposal to approve the merger?
Approval of the proposal to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock entitled to vote thereon.
What vote is required for TravelCenters’s stockholders to approve the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger?
The approval of the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may
be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.
What vote is required for TravelCenters’s stockholders to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary, to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are an insufficient number of
votes in favor of approving the merger?
The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if,
at the time of the special meeting, there are insufficient votes to approve the merger requires the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Do any of TravelCenters’s directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be
in addition to my interests as a stockholder?
In considering the recommendation of the TravelCenters Board with respect to the proposal to approve
the merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The
TravelCenters Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent such interests existed at
the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and
in recommending that the merger be approved by TravelCenters stockholders. See “The Merger - 
Interests of Certain Directors and Executive Officers of TravelCenters” beginning on page 50 and
“Proposal 2: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements”
beginning on page 86.
What is the difference between holding shares of TravelCenters common stock as a stockholder of record and as
a beneficial owner?
If on March 23, 2023, the record date for the special meeting, your shares of TravelCenters common
stock were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, then you are a stockholder “of
record.” If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting, or submit a
proxy by mail or over the Internet. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we urge you
to submit your proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the special meeting and vote
in person if you have already submitted a proxy. Voting in person will revoke your proxy.
If on March 23, 2023, the record date for the special meeting, your shares of TravelCenters common
stock were held not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other
similar organization, then your shares of TravelCenters common stock are held in “street name” and you
are the beneficial owner of the shares of TravelCenters common stock. If you are a beneficial owner of
shares of TravelCenters common stock registered in the name of your broker, bank, or other agent, you
should have received a voting instruction form with these proxy materials from that organization rather
than from us. Please return the voting instruction form to your broker, bank, or other nominee to ensure
that your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may submit your voting instructions over the Internet, as
instructed by your broker or bank. To vote in person at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid
proxy from your broker, bank, or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker or bank included
with these proxy materials or contact your broker or bank to request such a proxy form.
If my shares of TravelCenters common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, will my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares of TravelCenters common stock for me?
Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of TravelCenters
common stock if you instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should
follow the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting of
your shares of TravelCenters common stock. Banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares
in “street name” for customers have the authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not
received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are
precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving non-routine matters, such as
the proposals to be considered at the special meeting, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from
the beneficial owner of such shares of TravelCenters common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other
nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of TravelCenters common stock on non-routine
matters. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of
TravelCenters common stock, your shares of TravelCenters common stock will not be voted.
Who can vote at the special meeting?
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2023, the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting, are entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. On
the record date, 15,100,265 shares of TravelCenters common stock were issued and outstanding, each of
which is entitled to one vote upon each of the matters to be presented at the meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of TravelCenters common stock registered in the name of your
broker, bank, or other nominee, you should have received a voting instruction form with these proxy
materials from that organization rather than from us. Please return the voting instruction form to your
broker, bank, or other nominee to ensure that your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may submit your
voting instructions over the Internet, as instructed by your broker or bank. To vote in person at the
special meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank, or other nominee. Follow the
instructions from your broker or bank included with these proxy materials or contact your broker or
bank to request such a proxy form.
How many votes do I have?
Each holder of shares of TravelCenters common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter
properly brought before the special meeting for each share of TravelCenters common stock that such
holder owned as of the close of business on the record date of March 23, 2023. As of the close of
business on the record date, there were 15,100,265 shares of TravelCenters common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote, held by 559 holders of record.
What is the quorum requirement?
Under the MGCL, the presence in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock as of the record date and entitled to
vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Abstentions
and broker non-votes, if any, will be included in determining whether a quorum is present. A broker non-
vote is a vote that is not cast on a non-routine matter because the shares entitled to cast the vote are
held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, the broker, bank or other nominee lacks
discretionary authority to vote the shares and the broker, bank or other nominee has not received
voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Because all of the proposals to be voted on
at the special meeting are “non-routine” matters, brokers, banks and other nominees will not have
authority to vote on any proposals unless instructed, so TravelCenters does not expect there to be any
broker non-votes at the special meeting.
How do I vote?
If you are a stockholder of record, you may have your shares of TravelCenters common stock voted on
matters presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a legal proxy from
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee at the special meeting.
What effect do abstentions and “broker non-votes” have on the proposals?
Abstentions will not be considered votes cast on any proposal brought before the special meeting.
Because the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock is required to approve the proposal to approve the merger, the failure of any stockholder
of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or
to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the merger, and any abstention with respect to such proposal will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger.
Because the vote required to approve (i) the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger and (ii) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are an insufficient number of votes in favor
of approving the merger is, in each case, the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at
the special meeting, an abstention with respect to such proposals will not have the effect of a vote for
or against the relevant proposal, but will reduce the number of votes cast and therefore increase the
relative influence of those stockholders voting with respect to such proposals.
Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are “non-routine” matters, brokers,
banks and other nominees will not have authority to vote on any proposals unless instructed, so
TravelCenters does not expect there to be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.
How can I change or revoke my proxy?
If you own shares of TravelCenters common stock in your own name, you may revoke any prior proxy or
voting instructions, regardless of how your proxy or voting instructions were originally submitted, by:
sending a written statement to that effect to the Secretary of TravelCenters at Two Newton Place, 255
Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, which must be received by us by 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time on the business day immediately prior to the date of the special meeting;
submitting a properly signed proxy card dated a later date;
submitting a later dated proxy via the Internet or by telephone; or
attending the meeting virtually and voting your shares of TravelCenters common stock. Simply
attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you hold shares of TravelCenters common stock in “street name” by your bank, broker or other
nominee, please follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to
revoke or change your previously provided voting instructions.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of
TravelCenters common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted
on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote
your shares of TravelCenters common stock is called a “proxy card.”
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of TravelCenters common stock voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to submit your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed
proxy card will vote your shares of TravelCenters common stock in the way that you indicate. When
completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares
of TravelCenters common stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or
none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you own shares of TravelCenters common stock that are registered in your own name and return a
signed proxy card or grant a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, but do not indicate how you wish
your shares of TravelCenters common stock to be voted, the shares of TravelCenters common stock
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the
merger, “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
and “FOR” approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional
proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are an insufficient number of votes in favor of
approving the merger.
What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
If you received more than one proxy card, your shares of TravelCenters common stock are likely
registered in different names or with different addresses or are in more than one account. You must
separately vote the shares of TravelCenters common stock shown on each proxy card that you receive
in order for all of your shares of TravelCenters common stock to be voted at the meeting.
What happens if I sell my shares of TravelCenters common stock before the special meeting?
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than both the date of
the special meeting and the consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of TravelCenters
common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such
as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares of
TravelCenters common stock and each of you notifies TravelCenters in writing of such special
arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares of TravelCenters common stock at the
special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the per share merger consideration to the person to
whom you transfer your shares of TravelCenters common stock.
What happens if I sell my shares of TravelCenters common stock after the special meeting but before the
Effective Time?
If you transfer your shares of TravelCenters common stock after the special meeting but before the
Effective Time, you will have transferred the right to receive the per share merger consideration to the
person to whom you transfer your shares of TravelCenters common stock. In order to receive the per
share merger consideration, you must hold your shares of TravelCenters common stock through the
completion of the merger.
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
TravelCenters has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated, which we refer to as Innisfree, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. TravelCenters estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee of
$25,000. TravelCenters has agreed to reimburse Innisfree for certain fees and expenses and will also
indemnify Innisfree and its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses (including legal and other related
fees and expenses) arising out of or relating to Innisfree’s performance of the services.
What do I need to do now?
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information
contained in this proxy statement, please promptly submit your proxy to ensure that your shares of
TravelCenters common stock are represented at the special meeting. If you hold your shares of
TravelCenters common stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, you may submit a proxy to
have your shares of TravelCenters common stock voted at the special meeting in one of three ways: (i)
over the Internet, by going to the website www.proxyvote.com and, using the vote control number
printed on your proxy card, accessing your account and submitting a proxy for your shares, (ii) by
telephone, by calling 1-800-690-6903 from the United States and Canada and following the instructions
on your enclosed proxy card, or (iii) in writing by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy
card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope accompanying your proxy card. If you decide to attend the
special meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If

you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you.
Should I send in my share certificates now?
No. If the proposal to approve the merger is approved, after the completion of the merger, you will be
sent a letter of transmittal describing how you may exchange your shares of TravelCenters common
stock for the per share merger consideration. If your shares of TravelCenters common stock are held in
“street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should contact your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee for instructions as to how to effect the surrender of your “street name”
shares of TravelCenters common stock in exchange for the per share merger consideration. Please do
NOT return your share certificate(s) with your proxy.
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares
of TravelCenters common stock?
No. TravelCenters is incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Maryland. No
dissenters’ or appraisal rights or rights of an objecting holder of TravelCenters common stock pursuant
to the MGCL will be available with respect to the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.
Who can help answer any other questions I might have?
If you have additional questions about the merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting
your shares of TravelCenters common stock, or need additional copies of this proxy statement or the
enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree, our proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (877) 717-3905.

This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, contains
statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. Whenever we use words such as “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “will,” “may” and negatives and derivatives of these or similar
expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon
our present intent, beliefs or expectations, but forward-looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and
may not occur. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by our forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
some of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks
detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filing on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic
and interim reports, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and
the following factors:
the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the merger;
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of
the merger agreement, including a termination of the merger agreement under circumstances that
could require us to pay a termination fee;
the possibility that TravelCenters’s stockholders may not approve the proposal to approve the
merger;
the risk that the parties may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the merger,
including required regulatory approvals, in a timely manner or at all;
the failure of the merger to close for any other reason;
risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the merger;
limitations placed on our ability to operate the business by the merger agreement;
the outcome of any legal proceedings instituted against TravelCenters and/or others relating to the
merger agreement and the merger;
the risk that any announcements relating to the merger could have adverse effects on the market price
of shares of TravelCenters common stock;
the risk that the merger and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of
TravelCenters to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with its suppliers,
licensees, partners and customers, and on its operating results and businesses generally;
the potential impact on BP’s status as a key customer of TravelCenters if the merger is not
consummated; and
the fact that TravelCenters’s stockholders would forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-
term value of the successful execution of TravelCenters’s current strategy as an independent
company.
These forward-looking statements are also qualified by, and should be read together with, the “Warning
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” the “Risk Factors” and the other statements in our most recent
report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic and interim report filings, in each case as filed with the SEC
and available at www.sec.gov (see “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 95). No
assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from
the forward-looking statements.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. TravelCenters stockholders
are advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects as may be detailed in
our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2023 are entitled to notice of the
special meeting and to vote at the special meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof.
As of the record date, there were approximately 15,100,265 shares of TravelCenters common stock
outstanding and entitled to be voted at the special meeting.
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a special meeting. The presence in person or represented
by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters common
stock as of the record date and entitled to vote at the meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the
special meeting. As a result, 7,550,133 shares of TravelCenters common stock must be represented by proxy
or in person and entitled to vote at the special meeting to have a quorum.
In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the meeting would be
adjourned to a later date to solicit additional proxies.",30,30

Approval of the proposal to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock entitled to vote thereon. The
approval of such proposal is necessary to complete the merger.
Abstentions will be counted toward the presence of a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions will
not be considered votes cast on any proposal brought before the special meeting. Because the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to
approve the proposal to approve the merger, the failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed
proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote in person by ballot at the
special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger, and any
abstention with respect to such proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
approve the merger.
The approval of the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may
be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.
Abstentions from voting by a TravelCenters stockholder and the failure of any TravelCenters
stockholder to submit a vote will not be considered votes cast in respect of the proposal to approve, by a
non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named
22 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
executive officers in connection with the merger. Such proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, and so abstentions will not have the effect of a vote “FOR”
or “AGAINST” the proposal, but will reduce the number of votes cast and therefore increase the relative
influence of those stockholders voting with respect to such proposal. While the TravelCenters Board
intends to consider the vote resulting from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and therefore not binding
on TravelCenters or BP and, if the merger is approved by TravelCenters stockholders and consummated, and
the other relevant conditions relating to payment are met, the compensation will be payable even if the
proposal is not approved.
The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if,
at the time of the special meeting, there are insufficient votes to approve the merger requires the affirmative
vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.
Abstentions from voting by a TravelCenters stockholder and the failure of any TravelCenters
stockholder to submit a vote will not be considered votes cast in respect of the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting, and so will not have the effect of a vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” the proposal, but will reduce
the number of votes cast and therefore increase the relative influence of those stockholders voting with
respect to such proposal.
Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are “non-routine” matters, brokers,
banks and other nominees will not have authority to vote on any proposals unless instructed, so
TravelCenters does not expect there to be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.",30,31

Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares of

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person virtually, you will be able to vote at
the meeting. If your shares of TravelCenters common stock are registered in your name, you are encouraged
to submit a proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person. If you attend the special meeting
and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares of TravelCenters common stock
represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special
meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly executed proxies that do not contain
voting instructions will be voted (i) “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger, (ii) “FOR” the proposal to

to approve the merger will be voted in favor of the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the

with the merger, unless it is specifically marked “FOR” the approval of such proposal.

If the merger is not approved by TravelCenters stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, TravelCenters stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of TravelCenters
common stock. Instead, TravelCenters will remain a public company, the shares of TravelCenters common
stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have
caused the merger not to be consummated, it is likely that the price of shares of TravelCenters common stock
will decline potentially significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of shares of
TravelCenters common stock would return to the price at which they trade as of the date of this proxy
statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks
and opportunities on the future value of your shares of TravelCenters common stock. If the merger is not
consummated, the TravelCenters Board will continue to evaluate and review TravelCenters’s business
operations, properties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are
deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the merger is not approved by
TravelCenters stockholders, or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no
assurance that any other transaction acceptable to TravelCenters will be offered or that TravelCenters’s
business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, under specified circumstances, TravelCenters may be required to pay BP a termination fee
upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination of
the Merger Agreement - Termination Fee” beginning on page 82. Under specified circumstances, BP may be
required to pay TravelCenters a reverse termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as
described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement - Reverse Termination Fee”

The TravelCenters Board, together with members of TravelCenters’s senior management, regularly
reviews and assesses the performance, future growth prospects, business plans and overall strategic
direction of TravelCenters, and has considered a variety of strategic alternatives, including continuing to
pursue TravelCenters’s strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic transactions with
third parties, in each case with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.
Over the course of 2020 and 2021, Jonathan Pertchik, Chief Executive Officer of TravelCenters, in the
ordinary course of business, was introduced to many industry leaders and executives from various
companies, including convenience store companies and oil and gas companies.
On May 13, 2021, Mr. Pertchik was introduced to a representative of BP by Barry Richards, President of
TravelCenters, by email. BP’s representative was seeking to understand areas of common interest between
BP and TravelCenters, including potential commercial arrangements and, specifically, opportunities regarding
electric vehicle charging and low carbon fuels. On the same day, such representative of BP introduced Mr.
Pertchik by email to another representative of BP. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Pertchik and the second BP
representative spoke by telephone about their companies’ respective sustainability priorities, including
TravelCenters’s eTA initiative and its focus on alternative energy and sustainability. An additional
representative of BP was subsequently introduced to Mr. Pertchik, also by email. Subsequently, Mr. Pertchik
asked Dennis King, SVP of Corporate Development for TravelCenters, to follow up with such representative
of BP to explore opportunities for the two companies in the area of sustainable energy. On June 21, 2021, Mr.
King and a representative of BP spoke for the first time and continued to speak from time to time through
2021 and into early 2022 about sustainable energy opportunities that might benefit both companies, but there
were no discussions regarding a potential acquisition.
On August 20, 2021, a subsidiary of TravelCenters and BP entered into a confidentiality agreement in
connection with discussions about potential commercial relationship opportunities.
In early February 2022, Mr. Pertchik and representatives of BP met in person to further discuss potential
commercial opportunities, including opportunities within the sustainable and alternative energy markets.
During this meeting, the parties discussed broader initiatives, including the potential for a more
comprehensive strategic relationship. On April 4, 2022, Mr. Pertchik and a representative of BP had a follow-
up call during which the representative of BP suggested that Mr. Pertchik speak with another BP
representative. Mr. Pertchik and such other representative of BP subsequently spoke by telephone about a
potential strategic relationship and determined that the parties should enter into an amended and restated
confidentiality agreement prior to further discussions and, subject to entry into that agreement, schedule a
call for April 21, 2022.
In March 2022, a representative of Party A, a publicly traded, international energy company, contacted
Mr. Pertchik. Following this initial contact, on March 29, 2022, Mr. Pertchik, Adam D. Portnoy, Chair of the
TravelCenters Board, and several individuals from Party A, held a telephone meeting during which the
27 TABLE OF CONTENTS
parties shared ideas regarding a potential strategic relationship. Representatives of Party A and Mr. Pertchik
had several subsequent telephone calls to discuss a potential strategic relationship between April 11, 2022,
and May 11, 2022.
On April 4, 2022, a representative of Party B, a publicly traded, international oil and gas company, spoke
with Mr. Pertchik by telephone to discuss the possibility of a potential strategic relationship. Mr. Pertchik
and a representative of Party B had subsequent discussions on July 13, 2022, and October 3, 2022.
On April 6, 2022, a representative of Party C, a publicly traded fuel supplier and gasoline station
operator, spoke with Mr. Pertchik by telephone to discuss the possibility of a potential strategic relationship.
On April 7, 2022, following a regularly scheduled meeting of the TravelCenters Board, the directors held
an executive session without non-director management or advisors. Mr. Portnoy informed the TravelCenters
Board that TravelCenters had received unsolicited inquiries from four parties interested in potential strategic
relationships, which management understood could potentially include an acquisition of TravelCenters.
Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik summarized the inquiries and provided information about each of BP, Party A,
Party B and Party C. The TravelCenters Board considered the merits of engaging with these parties in light of
TravelCenters’s current and projected performance. The TravelCenters Board also considered the broader
merits and requirements of embarking upon a potential sale process more generally. The TravelCenters Board
recognized that the consent of Service Properties Trust (“SVC”), the landlord of most of TravelCenters’s
properties, would be required for a potential acquisition because of the resulting transfer of the leases
between TravelCenters and SVC (the “SVC Leases”), and that the creditworthiness of any potential buyer
would be of paramount importance to SVC in evaluating such transfer. Following this discussion, the
TravelCenters Board directed management to continue discussing with BP, Party A and Party B about
possible strategic transactions, including a possible acquisition of TravelCenters. The TravelCenters Board
directed management not to continue to engage with Party C as the TravelCenters Board did not view Party
C as a credible buyer due to concerns regarding Party C’s creditworthiness and liquidity, and they
questioned Party C’s ability to pay a sufficient purchase price.
On April 21, 2022, BP and TravelCenters entered into an amended and restated confidentiality
agreement, which included a standstill provision.
Also on April 21, 2022, Mr. Pertchik and Mark Young, TravelCenters’s Executive Vice President and
General Counsel, and representatives of BP had a call to discuss potential strategic arrangements between
the companies, including various commercial opportunities and a possible partnership with, and capital
investment into, TravelCenters to allow BP to, among other things, participate in TravelCenters’s planned
expansion into the sectors of sustainable and alternative energy.
On May 3, 2022, BP delivered to TravelCenters a written request for certain non-public commercial
information about TravelCenters. In response, TravelCenters provided certain written materials on May 22,
2022.
On May 11, 2022, representatives of TravelCenters and BP had a call to discuss further potential
strategic arrangements between the companies.
On June 9, 2022, following a regularly scheduled meeting of the TravelCenters Board, the directors held
an executive session without non-director management or advisors. Mr. Pertchik provided an update on
discussions with Party A and BP. Mr. Pertchik informed the TravelCenters Board that BP was evaluating
TravelCenters as a potential acquisition target, but that Party A seemed focused on a potential fuel
distribution arrangement. Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik then reviewed TravelCenters’s current and projected
performance and responded to questions from the other directors. Following discussion, the TravelCenters
Board concluded that management should continue to engage with BP and to allow BP to evaluate
TravelCenters, and that TravelCenters was not interested in a fuel distribution arrangement with Party A at
the time, but should maintain an open dialogue with Party A.
On June 10, 2022, TravelCenters entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A, which included a
standstill provision.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 16, 2022, representatives of TravelCenters and BP held a meeting to discuss BP’s diligence and
a potential strategic transaction between TravelCenters and BP. During the meeting, representatives of BP
indicated that BP might be interested in making an offer to acquire TravelCenters.
On June 17, 2022, Mr. Pertchik met telephonically with representatives of Party A. The representatives of
Party A indicated that they had interest in a broader strategic relationship and possible acquisition, however
their primary interest was in expanding their fuel distribution, particularly the distribution of diesel fuel. Mr.
Pertchik’s view was that it was unlikely that a fuel distribution agreement would be advantageous to
TravelCenters.
On June 28, 2022, Messrs. Pertchik and Portnoy and a representative of BP discussed the relationship
between TravelCenters and SVC and whether SVC would consider amending the SVC Leases to
accommodate certain business imperatives of BP.
On July 2, 2022, BP delivered to TravelCenters a written request for certain non-public commercial
information about TravelCenters. In response, TravelCenters provided certain written materials throughout
the course of late-July through September 2022, and representatives of BP and TravelCenters periodically
held telephonic meetings to discuss a potential transaction.
On July 20, 2022, TravelCenters executed a second amended and restated confidentiality agreement with
BP, which, among other things, added SVC and The RMR Group LLC (“RMR”) as parties. The amended and
restated confidentiality agreement contained a standstill provision.
On July 25, 2022, representatives of BP met with representatives of TravelCenters, SVC and RMR.
During this meeting, BP expressed interest in a potential acquisition of TravelCenters, asked questions of the
SVC representatives related to the SVC Leases and inquired whether SVC would be willing to sell some or all
of the leased properties to BP. BP informed TravelCenters and SVC of general business priorities it would
have related to amending the SVC Leases in connection with a potential acquisition. BP further inquired
whether SVC would be willing to sell some or all of the tradenames and trademarks it owned that were
associated with TravelCenters’s business. BP also inquired about the business management and shared
services arrangement between TravelCenters and RMR.
From time to time from June 2022 through October 2022, representatives of TravelCenters and BP had
conversations relating to a potential transaction.
On September 19, 2022, following a regularly scheduled meeting of the TravelCenters Board, the
directors held an executive session without non-director management or advisors. Mr. Portnoy noted that
TravelCenters had continued to engage with BP to facilitate BP’s evaluation of a potential acquisition of
TravelCenters but did not believe an offer would be forthcoming at this time. Mr. Pertchik informed the
TravelCenters Board that there had not been any further substantive discussions with Party A since mid-
June. Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik then reviewed TravelCenters’s current and projected performance and
responded to questions from the other directors. After a discussion, the TravelCenters Board determined to
engage a financial advisor to help it evaluate a potential sale of TravelCenters and, if the TravelCenters
Board determined to pursue a sale, to advise the TravelCenters Board. The TravelCenters Board directed
management to engage Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citi”) as its financial advisor based on Citi’s
familiarity with the Company and the industries in which TravelCenters operates, its expertise with
transactions of this type, and Citi’s prior engagements with TravelCenters.
On October 4, 2022, Citi met with TravelCenters management to discuss potential timing and process for
a potential sale of TravelCenters. Citi delivered a presentation regarding several topics in connection with a
potential sale, including a proposed timeline, marketing materials and the diligence process.
Between October 4, 2022, and late-October, TravelCenters management and Citi prepared a confidential
information memorandum to share with potential bidders and compiled diligence information to be provided
in a virtual data room.
In mid-October 2022, a representative of BP proposed to Mr. Pertchik a meeting with TravelCenters
management to continue discussions about a potential transaction.
29 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On or about October 20, 2022, Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik had a telephone meeting with
representatives of BP, who noted that BP remained interested in acquiring TravelCenters. The parties
discussed potential timing and other details of the process and agreed to remain in contact.
On October 26, 2022, representatives of Citi informed a representative of BP that a potential process may
begin soon for a potential transaction with TravelCenters, and a representative of BP indicated its interest in
being included in the initial outreach for the process.
On October 28, 2022, the TravelCenters Board held a meeting, with members of TravelCenters’s
management and representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray LLP, the Company’s outside counsel (“Ropes &
Gray”), in attendance. Mr. Portnoy described discussions with BP since the TravelCenters Board’s last
meeting and explained that management had been working with Citi to assemble a confidential information
memorandum, to populate a virtual data room and to prepare to run a sales process if the TravelCenters
Board determined to proceed. Mr. Portnoy also noted that SVC’s board of trustees had discussed the
potential transaction and had indicated that it would consider consenting to the transfer of the leases and
guarantees to certain counterparties if it was satisfied with the potential party’s creditworthiness. SVC also
indicated that, although it was not interested in selling any of the TravelCenters real estate at this time, it
would consider reasonable amendments to the SVC Leases and guarantees for a satisfactory counter party.
Citi then described a potential timeline for a sales process and identified 11 potential counterparties based on
their likely strategic interest and credit and financial capability. Citi explained that management directed Citi
to contact only strategic parties with strong credit profiles pre-approved by SVC because (i) SVC was
unlikely to provide its consent for a financial buyer or strategic party that required significant financing, as
such buyers would present greater risk of default as a lessee and (ii) a counterparty with a strong credit
rating would be more likely to be able to consummate the transaction given the current financing market. As
a result, the minimum credit rating for any counterparty to be contacted by Citi was BBB/ Baa2. Citi
responded to questions from the TravelCenters Board about the process and timing and, following
discussion, the TravelCenters Board directed Citi to contact each of the proposed strategic parties beginning
on October 31, 2022, and to coordinate with management to solicit indications of interest. The TravelCenters
Board also discussed the terms of Citi’s engagement letter and ratified the terms of the engagement.
During the week of October 31, 2022, Citi contacted the 11 parties authorized by the TravelCenters
Board and subsequently provided draft confidentiality agreements to eight of the parties. Following
negotiations, between November 9, 2022 and November 14, 2022, TravelCenters entered into confidentiality
agreements with Party D, a privately held international operator of gas stations and convenience stores,
Party E, a publicly traded international operator of gas stations and convenience stores, and Party F, a
subsidiary of an international energy company, each of which had a standstill provision. The other parties
contacted by Citi ultimately declined to sign a confidentiality agreement and did not pursue an acquisition of
TravelCenters.
On November 3, 2022, BP was granted access to a virtual data room that held, among other things,
limited non-public documentation on TravelCenters’s financials, leases, contracts and debt (the “Round I
VDR”). Promptly following their execution of confidentiality agreements, Parties D, E and F also received
access to the Round I VDR.
Between October 31, 2022, and December 13, 2022, TravelCenters responded to a variety of diligence
requests from the potential counterparties. Citi held brief meetings with the counterparties to respond to
questions and gauge interest. After BP entered into a supplemental clean team confidentiality agreement with
TravelCenters on December 6, 2022, TravelCenters also provided access to a separate data room (the “Clean
Room”) containing certain competitively sensitive information to representatives of and advisors to BP who
do not have responsibility for competitive business decisions for their respective employer or client.
On December 1, 2022, Party D informed Citi that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of
TravelCenters.
On December 12, 2022, the TravelCenters Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of
TravelCenters’s management and representatives of Ropes & Gray in attendance. Mr. Portnoy provided an
update on discussions with potential acquirors, identifying which parties had entered into confidentiality
30 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreements, which had notified Citi or TravelCenters they did not intend to proceed in the process, and
which were likely to submit proposals. Following the update, the TravelCenters Board discussed the timing
and process for the potential sale of TravelCenters, including the need for SVC to consent to the transaction
and likely negotiate lease amendments with any potential buyer. The TravelCenters Board agreed to hold a
meeting later in the week after initial proposals were received.
On December 13, 2022, TravelCenters received written non-binding proposals from Party E and BP. The
Party E proposal contemplated a purchase of 100% of the equity interests of TravelCenters for $71.00 per
share in cash (the “Party E Initial Proposal”). The BP proposal contemplated a purchase of 100% of the
equity interests of TravelCenters for $60.00 per share in cash (the “BP Initial Proposal”). The BP Initial
Proposal also summarized proposed modifications to the SVC Leases and noted an interest in retention of
TravelCenters’s employees including the management team. Also on December 13, 2022, Party F notified Citi
that it would no longer pursue an acquisition of TravelCenters.
On December 15, 2022, Party A notified Citi that it would not pursue a transaction with TravelCenters.
On December 16, 2022, the TravelCenters Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of
TravelCenters’s management and representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray in attendance. Citi summarized
the terms of the written non-binding proposals received from Party E and BP, including their proposed
purchase prices and other material terms and noted that the BP Initial Proposal set forth proposed
amendments to the SVC Leases while the Party E Initial Proposal did not. Citi noted that the other parties
who signed confidentiality agreements had elected not to pursue the transaction at this time and would not
submit proposals. Citi then described discussions that Citi had with BP following receipt of the BP Initial
Proposal, including advising BP that its proposed purchase price was not compelling. Mr. Portnoy described
BP’s feedback on the SVC Leases in more detail and noted for the TravelCenters Board that SVC was aware
of the identity of the bidders and Mr. Portnoy planned to preview BP’s lease proposals with SVC’s board of
trustees before TravelCenters responded to the bids. Mr. Portnoy and Citi responded to questions from the
directors and, after discussing the next steps in the process, the TravelCenters Board directed TravelCenters
management and advisors to continue pursuing a transaction, including providing BP and Party E with
access to additional diligence materials and a draft merger agreement, as well as hosting meetings for both
parties with management.
On December 17, 2022, representatives of Citi informed representatives of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“GS”),
BP’s financial advisor, that BP would be moving on to the next round of the process. Representatives of Citi
told representatives of GS that BP would be moving on even though its bid was well below a price at which
the TravelCenters Board indicated TravelCenters would be willing to enter into a transaction, and that BP’s
strong balance sheet and creditworthiness, while viewed highly positively, did not distinguish its bid as
other bidders shared the same attributes.
On December 22, 2022, at the direction of the TravelCenters Board, TravelCenters granted BP and Party
E access to an expanded data room that contained substantially all of the documentation TravelCenters
management determined was necessary for potential bidders to complete their diligence of TravelCenters and
its operations (the “Round II VDR”), and on December 23, 2022, TravelCenters granted Party E and its
financial and legal advisors who do not have responsibility for competitive business decisions for their
respective employer or client access to the Clean Room.
On January 9, 2023 and January 10, 2023, representatives of Citi reached out to both representatives of
BP and GS to provide certain bidding instructions and to emphasize that BP would need to substantially
increase its price in order to be able to acquire TravelCenters and indicated BP should put forward its best
bid.
On January 10, 2023, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, Ropes & Gray posted the draft merger
agreement to the Round II VDR for potential bidders to review and comment upon.
Also, on January 10, 2023, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, Citi sent a formal process letter to BP
and Party E, which requested that each party submit revised drafts of the draft merger agreement, which was
posted to the Round II VDR on January 10, and Lease Documentation (as defined below), on or before
February 1, 2023, and to submit final proposals, including a proposed per share purchase price, by February
7, 2023.
31 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 12, 2023, as directed by SVC, Citi posted to the Round II VDR a draft Consent and
Amendment Agreement, which provided that (i) SVC would consent to the entry by TravelCenters into the
merger agreement and any resulting change in control of TravelCenters resulting from the proposed merger
transaction, (ii) simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, a subsidiary of TravelCenters, and certain
subsidiaries of SVC would amend and restate the SVC Leases and an affiliate of the potential buyer and
certain subsidiaries of SVC would amend and restate the guarantees by TravelCenters in respect thereof, and
(iii) simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, the SVC parties would sell certain trademarks to
TravelCenters for an amount equal to their net book value of $89.4 million (the “Consent and Amendment
Agreement”). Citi, as directed by SVC, also posted drafts of the amended and restated SVC Leases that
would be entered into pursuant to the Consent and Amendment Agreement (the “Amended and Restated
Leases”) and the guarantees that would be amended pursuant to the Consent and Amendment Agreement
(the “Amended and Restated Guarantees”, together with the Amended and Restated Leases and the Consent
and Amendment Agreement, the “Lease Documentation”).
On January 18, 2023, TravelCenters management, including Messrs. Pertchik, Crage and Young, and
representatives of Citi made a presentation to members of BP’s management in Cleveland, Ohio regarding
TravelCenters’s business and Mr. Pertchik conducted a tour for BP of one of TravelCenters’s local travel
centers.
Between January 18, 2023, and January 26, 2023, TravelCenters and Party E participated in due diligence
sessions, relating to business and financial, technology, IT, procurement, legal and insurance matters among
other topics. On January 20, 2023, TravelCenters management, including Messrs. Pertchik, Crage and Young,
and representatives of Citi made a presentation to members of Party E’s management in Cleveland, Ohio and
Mr. Pertchik conducted a tour for Party E of one of TravelCenters’s local travel centers.
On January 23, 2023, Citi met with representatives of BP to discuss TravelCenters’s financial model,
capital expenditure spending, and growth rate assumptions in TravelCenters’s model.
On January 25, 2023, Messrs. Portnoy and Pertchik and a representative of Citi hosted a dinner meeting
in Boston, Massachusetts with representatives of BP. During the dinner, they discussed the potential
transaction, TravelCenters’s business plans and BP’s strategic plan for TravelCenters.
On January 27, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters’s management and
representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray in attendance. Mr. Portnoy provided an update on the process,
noting that, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, TravelCenters management and its advisors continued
to work closely with BP and Party E and that there was extensive engagement from senior management at
both counterparties. Mr. Portnoy then described the management presentations and site visits with BP and
Party E and highlighted the meeting Mr. Portnoy and Mr. Pertchik had with representatives of BP and how
the meeting reinforced BP’s interest. Mr. Portnoy also noted that he expected each party to submit updated
non-binding proposals on or before the February 7, 2023, deadline set forth in the process letter. Messrs.
Pertchik and Portnoy and Citi responded to questions from the directors and the TravelCenters Board
engaged in extensive discussion.
On January 31, 2023, representatives of Citi, TravelCenters management and BP management held a
meeting about TravelCenters’s liquified natural gas capabilities.
On February 1, 2023, both BP and Party E submitted comments on the merger agreement to Ropes &
Gray. BP also submitted detailed comments on the Lease Documentation, but Party E submitted only a
general issues list with respect to the Lease Documentation.
On February 3, 2023, representatives of Citi and GS discussed the upcoming submission deadline. Citi
strongly encouraged GS to work with BP to put its best price in its submission based on the TravelCenters
Board’s current intention that there would not be a third round of the process and that TravelCenters’s
intent was to select the best offer and move expeditiously to finalize transaction documents following the
second round bids.
On February 5, 2023, as directed by the TravelCenters Board, Ropes & Gray posted a draft of
TravelCenters’s disclosure schedules to the Round II VDR.
32 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 7, 2023, TravelCenters received non-binding written proposals from both Party E and BP.
The Party E proposal contemplated a purchase of 100% of the equity interests of TravelCenters for $68.00 per
share in cash (the “Party E Final Proposal”). The Party E Final Proposal noted that Party E had outstanding
diligence requests but expected to be able to complete its review within thirty days. The BP proposal
contemplated a purchase of 100% of the equity interests of TravelCenters for $86.00 per share in cash (the
“BP Final Proposal”). The BP Final Proposal noted that the diligence process was substantially complete.
Neither party provided updated drafts of the merger agreement or Lease Documentation with their respective
final proposals.
On February 8, 2023, ahead of a TravelCenters Board meeting, representatives of Citi provided Citi’s
relationship disclosure letter to TravelCenters.
Also on February 8, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters’s management
and representatives of Citi and Ropes & Gray in attendance. The TravelCenters Board discussed the BP Final
Proposal and the Party E Final Proposal. Representatives of Ropes & Gray also provided feedback on the BP
and Party E’s markup of the merger agreement, noting that (i) Party E provided only a partial markup that
reserved comment on a number of critical terms and provisions and (ii) BP’s detailed markup, among other
points, increased the termination fee, proposed an antitrust covenant that capped BP’s potential divestiture
obligations, provided for an antitrust reverse termination fee, required that voting agreements from SVC and
RMR be delivered at signing, expanded the interim operating covenants and made certain pro-buyer changes
to the closing conditions. Following discussions, the TravelCenters Board directed management to negotiate
a transaction with BP.
On February 9, 2023, Citi notified BP that TravelCenters would agree to the price proposed in the BP
Final Proposal of the Lease Documentation provided that the parties negotiated a satisfactory merger
agreement and BP and SVC agreed on the terms.
Also on February 9, 2023, Ropes & Gray provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP (“Sullivan & Cromwell”), counsel to BP, and Sullivan & Worcester LLP (“Sullivan &
Worcester”), counsel to SVC in connection with the Lease Documentation, sent revised drafts of the Lease
Documentation to Sullivan & Cromwell. In the revised merger agreement, Ropes & Gray generally accepted
on TravelCenters’s behalf the requirement of voting agreements and the antitrust framework of a divestiture
cap and reverse termination fee but continued to negotiate the size of the divestiture cap, the size of BP’s
termination fee as well as the Company’s termination fee, certain other provisions including the interim
operating covenants, the closing conditions, representations and warranties and the company termination
fee triggers. In the Lease Documentation, Sullivan & Worcester proposed revisions, among other terms, to
the guarantor creditworthiness requirements, limitation on guarantor liability, length of the fixed and
extended lease terms, mineral rights, holdover penalties, periodic financial information disclosures and
confidentiality provisions.
Between February 11, 2023, and February 15, 2023, the parties and their legal and financial advisors
engaged in negotiations regarding, and exchanged drafts of, the proposed merger agreement and disclosure
schedules, as well as drafts of the form of voting agreement and the Consent and Amendment Agreement
and related Lease Documentation. In negotiating the merger agreement, the parties, working with their legal
and financial advisors, agreed on the termination fees, triggers, outside date and certain other terms with
respect to the interim operating covenants, the closing conditions, and the representations and warranties.
As to Lease Documentation, the parties agreed to, among other things, the requirement that the guarantor
have either a net worth exceeding $15 billion, a credit rating of at least BBB- or Baa2, or otherwise have a
creditworthiness that is acceptable to SVC, holdover rent on a property-by-property basis and an indemnity
for certain damages resulting from holdover, and a confidentiality provision that allowed for required
securities disclosures. As to the voting agreement, the parties agreed on resolutions of certain outstanding
negotiated points regarding the ability of RMR and SVC to make public announcements, and removal of
reliance and legal proxy provisions. Lastly, the parties finalized the terms of the Consent and Amendment
Agreement. With these issues resolved, the SVC and RMR boards agreed to enter into the voting agreement
and the SVC board agreed to enter into the Consent and Amendment Agreement.
On February 15, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters’s management and
representatives of Citi, Ropes & Gray and Venable LLP, Maryland counsel to TravelCenters (“Venable”),

TABLE OF CONTENTS
present. At the meeting, Ropes & Gray reviewed the terms and conditions of the transaction documents,
including the structure, closing conditions, antitrust and divestiture covenant, interim operating covenants,
representations and warranties, non-solicitation covenant, termination rights and fees, and end date
extensions. Venable then summarized for the TravelCenters Board its duties as directors under Maryland
corporate law in the context of the potential transaction. Citi then reviewed its financial analysis of the
merger consideration and delivered to the TravelCenters Board its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated February 15, 2023, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Citi
in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of TravelCenters common
stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of TravelCenters common stock (other than (i) BP
and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive business management services from
RMR, including SVC or any of their respective affiliates), as more fully described below in the section “-
Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” Following discussions about the proposed transaction with BP,
including the potential merits and considerations for and against proceeding with it described further in the
section “ - Recommendation of the TravelCenters Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the
TravelCenters Board unanimously (i) determined and declared that the terms of the merger agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the merger agreement), the merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of TravelCenters and TravelCenters’s
stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and, subject to the Company stockholder approval, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, (iii) directed that the approval of the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement be submitted to a vote of the holders of TravelCenters common stock at a meeting of
TravelCenters’s stockholders and (iv) resolved to include in this proxy statement the recommendation of the
TravelCenters Board to the holders of TravelCenters common stock to vote in favor of approval of the
merger by the TravelCenters’s stockholders.
On February 15, 2023, following the approval by the TravelCenters Board of the merger agreement, the
parties executed the merger agreement, the Consent and Amendment Agreement, the voting agreements and
the other documentation related to the merger.
On the morning of February 16, 2023, TravelCenters and BP p.l.c. each issued a press release
announcing the transaction and a representative from Citi notified Party E of the transaction.
On March 14, 2023, TravelCenters received an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest from
ARKO Corp. (“ARKO”), a publicly traded fuel supplier and convenience store operator to purchase 100% of
the equity interests of TravelCenters for $92.00 per share (the “ARKO Proposal”). The ARKO Proposal
indicated that ARKO planned to finance the purchase through a combination of cash on hand, external
financing and lines of credit and contemplated a 30 day timeline to conduct diligence and sign definitive
agreements. ARKO indicated that they were prepared to enter into the Lease Documentation under
substantially the same terms as BP entered into, including entering into restated guarantees of leases on
substantially the same terms as those set forth in the Consent and Amendment Agreement which would
include having ARKO as the guarantor. The ARKO Proposal also included a letter from a potential financing
source indicating that “subject to certain terms and conditions, including pricing” it was prepared to commit
to finance the acquisition.
On March 15, TravelCenters informed BP of the receipt of the ARKO Proposal pursuant to its
notification obligations under the merger agreement.
On March 17, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters’s management and
representatives of Citi, Ropes & Gray and Venable in attendance. Mr. Portnoy described the ARKO Proposal,
a copy of which had been circulated to the TravelCenters Board in advance of the meeting, and shared
certain publicly available information about ARKO. A representative of Ropes & Gray described the
restrictions imposed by the merger agreement on TravelCenters’s and its representatives’ ability to discuss
the ARKO Proposal with ARKO and its representatives and certain factors the TravelCenters Board should
consider in evaluating whether the ARKO Proposal may constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the merger agreement). A representative of Venable then summarized the
directors’ duties under Maryland law in the context of the ARKO Proposal. The TravelCenters Board
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
engaged in a discussion of the ARKO Proposal and its impact on the merger agreement and process with BP,
and Mr. Portnoy and the advisors to the TravelCenters Board responded to questions from the directors.
Following discussion, the TravelCenters Board determined to meet again the following week to again discuss
the ARKO Proposal and requested that TravelCenters’s management and the advisors gather certain
information, including information regarding ARKO and the ARKO Proposal, to help inform their
deliberations.
On March 22, 2023, the TravelCenters Board met, with members of TravelCenters’s management and
representatives of Citi, Ropes & Gray and Venable in attendance. Mr. Portnoy reminded the TravelCenters
Board of the terms and conditions of the ARKO Proposal and presented certain general information about
ARKO’s financial condition and business. Mr. Portnoy also provided an update about the status of the
transaction with BP, including that the parties had filed notifications of the merger with the Federal Trade
Commission and Department of Justice under the HSR Act on March 9, 2023, and the initial 30 day review
period expires on April 10, 2023. Mr. Portnoy further advised the TravelCenters Board that SVC’s board of
trustees, and all of its independent trustees, had reached a preliminary consensus, that given ARKO’s credit
rating and financial conditions, SVC would not engage in negotiations with or consent to the assignment of
the Lease Documentation to ARKO in connection with a change of control of TravelCenters. A
representative of Venable summarized the directors’ duties under Maryland law in the context of the ARKO
Proposal. The TravelCenters Board’s advisors responded to questions from the directors and the directors
discussed their views on the ARKO Proposal. The independent directors then held an executive session with
their advisors and without TravelCenters’s managing directors or other management. The independent
directors further discussed ARKO and the ARKO Proposal’s terms and conditions and asked additional
questions of their advisors. Following discussion, the independent directors concluded that the ARKO
Proposal did not constitute a Superior Proposal and could not reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. The independent directors identified, among other reasons for their conclusion, that, despite
ARKO proposing a higher per share price than BP has agreed to pay, (i) the ARKO Proposal indicated that
ARKO would require significant third-party financing and there was no firm commitment from a potential
financing source to provide such financing and the financing markets remain uncertain; (ii) ARKO indicated
that it would require approximately 30 days to complete diligence and enter into definitive agreements, which
would delay consummation of a potential sale of TravelCenters and during which time the pending
transaction would remain subject to risks related to the performance of each counterparty and
macroeconomic factors; (iii) ARKO indicated that, subject to diligence, it may enter into definitive
transaction agreements substantially similar to those executed by BP, but did not provide draft agreements or
proposed changes for the TravelCenters Board’s consideration; (iv) the TravelCenters Board has determined
that BP’s commitment to take certain actions to satisfy the requirements under the HSR Act provides
significant deal certainty whereas, based on information in the ARKO Proposal and public information, the
TravelCenters Board cannot conclude that the potential regulatory risks related to the ARKO Proposal could
be similarly mitigated to provide similar deal certainty; (v) the only regulatory closing condition in the merger
agreement relates to the HSR Act, but ARKO stated it would need to obtain “all required governmental and
regulatory authorization” to consummate the transaction which would cause further delay and uncertainty;
and (vi) the SVC board, including all of the SVC independent trustees, had reached a preliminary consensus
that because of ARKO’s credit rating and financial condition, SVC would not consent to the assignment of
leases or accept ARKO or its affiliates as a guarantor. Following the executive session, the full TravelCenters
Board reconvened with TravelCenters’s management and, following discussion, unanimously determined,
including for the reasons outlined above, that the ARKO Proposal does not constitute a Superior Proposal
and could not reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. The TravelCenters Board then directed
TravelCenters’s management to notify ARKO and BP of its conclusion.
On March 22, 2023, TravelCenters delivered to ARKO a letter in response to the ARKO Proposal (the
“TA Response Letter”). The TA Response Letter communicated the TravelCenters Board’s determination that
the ARKO Proposal did not constitute a Superior Proposal and could not reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and, therefore, TravelCenters and its representatives were contractually prohibited by the
merger agreement from participating in discussions related to the ARKO Proposal.
On March 27, 2023, TravelCenters received an additional letter from ARKO that restated the terms of the
ARKO Proposal and asked the TravelCenters Board to reconsider the ARKO Proposal (the “March 27 ARKO
Letter”). Simultaneously with sending the March 27 ARKO Letter, ARKO (i) issued a press release

TravelCenters of America Inc. MD_20230403_DEFM14A_20770239_4639300.Pdf,Recommendation of the TravelCenters Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,"Recommendation of the TravelCenters Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger
The TravelCenters Board recommends that TravelCenters stockholders vote (i) “FOR” the proposal to
approve the merger, (ii) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s named executive officers in connection with the
merger and (iii) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting of TravelCenters stockholders, if
necessary, to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of the special meeting, there are insufficient votes to
approve the merger.
At a meeting held on February 15, 2023, the TravelCenters Board unanimously (i) determined and
declared that the terms of the merger agreement, the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the merger
agreement), the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best
interests of TravelCenters and TravelCenters’s stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of the merger agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and, subject to the Company stockholder
approval, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger) upon the terms
and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
subject to the conditions set forth therein, (iii) directed that the approval of the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of the holders of TravelCenters
common stock at a meeting of TravelCenters’s stockholders and (iv) resolved to include in this proxy
statement the recommendation of the TravelCenters Board to the holders of TravelCenters common stock to
vote in favor of approval of the merger by the TravelCenters’s stockholders.
In reaching its recommendation that TravelCenters stockholders vote for the proposal to approve the
merger, the TravelCenters Board consulted with TravelCenters management, Citi, and Ropes & Gray and
considered a number of reasons, including the following non-exhaustive list of reasons (not included in any
relative order of importance) that the TravelCenters Board believes support its determination and
recommendation:
Business and Financial Condition of TravelCenters. The TravelCenters Board considered TravelCenters’s
current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position,
properties, assets and prospects, as well as TravelCenters’s long-range plan. The TravelCenters
Board weighed the certainty of stockholders realizing a compelling value for shares of
TravelCenters’s common stock in the merger compared to the uncertainty that trading values would
approach the per share merger consideration in the foreseeable future and the risk and uncertainty
associated with TravelCenters and its business. The TravelCenters Board also believed that the
acquisition of TravelCenters by BP for $86.00 per TravelCenters share in cash was more favorable to
TravelCenters’s stockholders than the value of remaining an independent public company. The
TravelCenters Board reached this conclusion because of, among other things, (i) the uncertainty in
the market, including the potential decrease in demand for trucking services, which could be
adversely affected by a recession and/or inflationary pressures, (ii) environmental regulations and
increased compliance costs, (iii) the market reaction to climate change and decreasing demand for
diesel, (iv) the volatility of the oil and gas industry, especially given recent fluctuations as a result of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and (v) increasing motor vehicle fuel efficiency, fuel conservation
practices and adoption of alternative fuels or energy sources.
Implied Premium. The TravelCenters Board considered that the per share merger consideration
represented an approximately 74% premium over TravelCenters’s closing share price on February 15,
2023. The TravelCenters Board considered that, following a thorough and competitive bid process, in
its view, it had obtained BP’s best and final offer and that, as of the date of the merger agreement, the
per share merger consideration represented the highest per share merger consideration reasonably
obtainable.
Per Share Merger Consideration. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that 100% of the merger
consideration will be paid in cash at the closing of the merger, which provides TravelCenters
stockholders with immediate liquidity and a high degree of certainty of value.
Potentially Interested Counterparties. The TravelCenters Board considered, with the benefit of its
investor and industry expertise, after discussing with Citi and management of TravelCenters, (i) the
results of the process that had been conducted to solicit proposals for alternative transactions and
the resulting discussions and negotiations and (ii) the fact that none of these discussions or
negotiations resulted in a better proposal. The TravelCenters Board also considered the ability of
other creditworthy bidders to make proposals at higher prices per share than the BP offer price.
Strategic Alternatives. The TravelCenters Board considered, after discussions with Citi, possible
alternatives to the merger, including the execution of management’s standalone plan and the risks
associated with this alternative. The TravelCenters Board determined not to pursue strategic
alternatives in light of its belief that the merger is more favorable to TravelCenters’s stockholders
than such alternatives. The TravelCenters Board also considered its belief that the value offered to
holders of shares of TravelCenters common stock in the merger was more favorable to holders of
TravelCenters common stock than the risk-adjusted value of remaining an independent public
company.
Certain Management Projections. The TravelCenters Board considered certain prospective forecasts for
TravelCenters prepared by senior management of TravelCenters, which reflect an application of
various commercial assumptions of TravelCenters’s senior management. For further discussion, see
the section entitled “- Certain Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 47.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Citi’s Fairness Opinion and Related Analyses. The TravelCenters Board considered the financial
presentation, analyses and oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion,
dated February 15, 2023, of Citi to the TravelCenters Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view and as of the date of the written opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by the
holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive
business management services from RMR, including SVC, or any of their respective affiliates) of
outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion
was based on and subject to the assumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other matters
considered on the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion as more fully described below in
the section entitled “Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.” beginning on page 41.
Likelihood of Completion. The TravelCenters Board considered the likelihood that the merger would be
completed based on, among other things (not listed in any relative order of importance):
the fact that the conditions to the closing of the merger are specific and limited in scope;
the business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of BP and its strong track record
of involvement with capital intensive projects in the energy industry, and the TravelCenters
Board’s conclusion that BP is willing to devote the resources necessary to close the merger in an
expeditious manner;
BP’s financial condition and creditworthiness and ability to complete the transaction without
requiring additional financing;
BP’s obligation under the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the transaction, including taking certain
specified actions if required by regulatory authorities in order to obtain such approvals; and
TravelCenters’s ability, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to seek
specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement by BP and/or Merger
Subsidiary and to enforce the terms of the merger agreement.
Negotiation Process and Procedural Fairness. The TravelCenters Board considered the enhancements
that TravelCenters and its advisors were able to obtain as a result of robust arm’s-length negotiations
with BP, including the increase in the offer price proposed by BP from the time of its initial proposal to
the end of the negotiations and the ability of TravelCenters to terminate the merger agreement to
accept a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions as more fully described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Superior Proposal.”
Other Terms of the Merger Agreement. The TravelCenters Board considered other terms of the merger
agreement, which are more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning
on page 59. Certain provisions of the merger agreement that the TravelCenters Board considered
important included:
Ability to Respond to Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. At any time prior to obtaining the
TravelCenters stockholder approval for the proposal to approve the merger, in the event that
TravelCenters receives a written, bona fide, unsolicited acquisition proposal from any third party
that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation of the merger agreement, and if
the TravelCenters Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal and the failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the duties of the TravelCenters Board under applicable law, the ability of
TravelCenters and its acquisition representatives to:
furnish, pursuant to (but only pursuant to) an acceptable confidentiality agreement, non-
public information relating to TravelCenters or any of its Subsidiaries, to the third party, or
its acquisition representatives; and
engage in negotiations or discussions with the third party and its acquisition
representatives.
Change of Recommendation. Subject to certain notice obligations to BP and certain obligations to
discuss and negotiate in good faith any revisions proposed by BP to the merger agreement in
38 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
response to such notice, at any time prior to obtaining the TravelCenters stockholder approval
for the proposal to approve the merger, the TravelCenters Board may:
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the merger agreement); or
cause TravelCenters to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to and in compliance
therewith in order to enter into a binding written definitive agreement providing for such
superior proposal.
Material Adverse Effect. The number and type of matters that are specifically excluded from being
considered in determining whether a material adverse effect has or would reasonably be expected
to occur.
End Date. The end date under the merger agreement on which either party, subject to certain
exceptions or extensions, can terminate the merger agreement allows for sufficient time to
consummate the merger, while minimizing the length of time during which TravelCenters would
be required to operate subject to the restrictions on interim operations set forth in the merger
agreement.
Cooperation. Subject to the terms and conditions therein, the merger agreement requires BP to use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate the merger and sets forth agreed actions with respect
to BP’s obligations to obtain requisite approvals to consummate the merger.
Stockholder Approval. Holders of at least a majority of outstanding shares of TravelCenters’s
common stock must vote in favor of a proposal to approve the merger.
Reverse Termination Fee. BP will be required to pay a reverse termination fee to TravelCenters of
$90.9 million if TravelCenters or BP terminate the merger agreement if:
the end date and any applicable extension has passed; or
any Restraint (as defined herein) (solely in respect of antitrust laws) is in effect permanently
enjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of the merger and such
Restraint becomes final and nonappealable and, in either case, as of the time of such
termination, either the conditions precedent with respect to (i) Restraints (solely in respect
of antitrust laws) or (ii) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods or
approval under applicable antitrust laws remain the only conditions precedent that have not
been satisfied or waived (or in the case of those conditions that by their own terms are to be
satisfied at the closing of the merger, such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the
closing of the merger were to occur on the date of termination).
Antitrust Efforts. The fact that TravelCenters and BP agreed to use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the merger and to comply with requests under any applicable antitrust law and
cooperate with each other in connection with any required filings. Further, BP agreed to take any
and all action necessary, including Divestiture Actions (as further described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Efforts to Close the Merger - Antitrust Filings and Related
Actions”), to receive the necessary antitrust approval, subject to certain limitations and
conditions as further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Efforts to Close
the Merger - Antitrust Filings and Related Actions”.
Leases. The consent of SVC is necessary to effectuate the transaction and to amend various
leases and guarantees to which a subsidiary of TravelCenters is a party. The TravelCenters
Board understands that creditworthiness was paramount to SVC in agreeing to new
counterparties to these leases and guarantees. SVC found BP Corporation North America Inc.’s
A3 / A- credit rating acceptable in this respect and, in connection with negotiating a continuing
minimum investment grade credit rating of at least BBB- or Baa3 or a minimum net worth
requirement of $15 billion for any replacement guarantor not affiliated with BP p.l.c, was willing to
sign the Consent and Amendment Agreement and recognize BP Corporation North America Inc.
as an acceptable guarantor.
The TravelCenters Board also considered a variety of potentially negative reasons in its deliberations
concerning the merger agreement and the merger, including the following (not included in any relative
order of importance):
39 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
No Ongoing Equity Interest in TravelCenters. The merger would preclude TravelCenters’s
stockholders from participating in the future performance of TravelCenters’s assets and any
potential future appreciation of the value of shares of TravelCenters common stock.
Inability to Solicit Other Takeover Proposals. The merger agreement includes a covenant prohibiting
TravelCenters and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers or directors and certain
representatives (as further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation”) from directly or indirectly soliciting, initiating, proposing, knowingly facilitating,
knowingly inducing or knowingly encouraging the submission or announcement of any
acquisition proposals. The TravelCenters Board also considered the fact that the right afforded
to BP under the merger agreement to re-negotiate the merger agreement in light of acquisition
proposals that the TravelCenters Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead
to superior proposals may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a
business combination with, or an acquisition of, TravelCenters.
TravelCenters Termination Fee. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that TravelCenters
may be required to pay a termination fee of $51.9 million if the merger agreement is terminated
under certain circumstances, including if, prior to receiving the TravelCenters stockholder
approval, the TravelCenters Board authorizes TravelCenters, pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal, and that the
amount of the termination fee is comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size,
was reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be
paid unless TravelCenters entered into a more favorable transaction.
Effect of Announcement. The TravelCenters Board considered the effect of the public
announcement of the transaction on TravelCenters’s operations, including its relationships with
customers, distributors, vendors and employees, as well as its ability to attract and retain key
management and other personnel while the proposed transaction is pending and the possibility
of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.
Interim Operating Covenants. The TravelCenters Board considered that the merger agreement
imposes restrictions on the conduct of TravelCenters’s business prior to the consummation of
the merger, requiring, amongst other things, TravelCenters to use its reasonable best efforts to
conduct its business in the ordinary course, and that may limit TravelCenters from taking
specified actions, subject to specific limitations.
Risks the Merger May Not Be Completed. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that all
conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the merger may not be satisfied. The
TravelCenters Board also considered the risks and costs to TravelCenters if the merger is not
consummated, including the diversion of management and employee attention, potential
employee attrition, the potential effect on vendors, distributors, customers, partners, licensees
and others that do business with TravelCenters, the negative impact a failed transaction could
have on TravelCenters’s commercial relationship with BP and, therefore, TravelCenters’s future
revenues and the potential effect on the trading price of TravelCenters common stock.
Transaction Costs. The TravelCenters Board considered the fact that significant costs are
involved in connection with entering into and completing the merger (many of which are payable
whether or not the merger is consummated) and substantial time and effort of management is
required to complete the merger, potentially resulting in disruptions to the operation of
TravelCenters’s business.
Potential Conflicts of Interest. The TravelCenters Board considered the potential conflict of
interest created by the fact that certain of TravelCenters’s executive officers and directors may
have financial interests in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger, that may be different from or in addition to those of other TravelCenters stockholders, as
more fully described in the section entitled “- Interests of Certain Directors and Executive
Officers of TravelCenters” beginning on page 50.

The TravelCenters Board has engaged Citi as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. On
February 15, 2023, at a meeting of the TravelCenters Board to evaluate the merger, Citi delivered to the
TravelCenters Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion dated
February 15, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of the written opinion and based on and subject to the
assumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in the written opinion, the $86.00 in
cash per outstanding common share to be received by the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii)
RMR or any entities managed by or that receive business management services from RMR, including SVC, or
any of their respective affiliates) of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Citi’s written opinion, dated February 15, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered on the review undertaken by Citi in
rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by
reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi’s opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the opinion. TravelCenters urges you to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Citi’s opinion, the
issuance of which was authorized by Citi’s fairness opinion committee, was provided for the information of the
TravelCenters Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the proposed merger and was limited to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, as of the date of the written opinion, of the $86.00 in cash per outstanding common share
to be received by the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any entities managed by or that receive
business management services from RMR, including SVC,or any of their respective affiliates) of outstanding shares
of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Citi’s opinion does not address any other aspects
or implications of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed merger. Citi’s
opinion does not address TravelCenters’s underlying business decision to effect the merger, the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for TravelCenters or the effect of any other
transaction in which TravelCenters might engage. The following is a summary of Citi’s opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Citi, among other things:
reviewed a draft, dated February 15, 2023, of the merger agreement;
held discussions with certain of TravelCenters’s senior officers, directors and other representatives
and advisors concerning TravelCenters’s business, operations and prospects;
examined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to TravelCenters;
41 •

• 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
examined certain financial forecasts and other information and data relating to TravelCenters which
were provided to or discussed with Citi by TravelCenters management, which are referred to as the
“Management Forecast”, as summarized in the section entitled “The Merger - Certain Financial
Forecasts”);
reviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement in relation to, among
other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of TravelCenters’s stock,
TravelCenters’s historical and projected earnings and other operating data and TravelCenters’s
capitalization and financial condition;
considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citi
considered relevant in evaluating the merger;
analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the
businesses of other companies whose operations Citi considered relevant in evaluating those of
TravelCenters; and
conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and
financial, economic and market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.
In connection with Citi’s engagement, at the direction of TravelCenters, and with the approval of SVC,
TravelCenters’s landlord for a substantial number of TravelCenters’s properties pursuant to the SVC Leases,
which leases provide that TravelCenters’ rights and benefits under those agreements may be terminated in
the event that TravelCenters experiences a change in control, as defined in the SVC Leases, Citi was
requested to approach, and held discussions with, selected third parties to solicit indications of interest in
TravelCenters’s possible acquisition.
In rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy
and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi and upon the assurances of TravelCenters management that
they were not aware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With
respect to the Management Forecast and other information and data relating to TravelCenters provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by TravelCenters management that the
Management Forecast was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of TravelCenters management as to TravelCenters’s future financial performance. Citi also
assumed, with TravelCenters’s consent, that the financial results reflected in the Management Forecast and
other information and data will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.
Citi also assumed, with TravelCenters’s consent, that the merger will be consummated in accordance
with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and
that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third-party approvals, consents and releases for
the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on
TravelCenters or the merger. TravelCenters’s representatives advised Citi, and Citi has further assumed, that
the final terms of the merger agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed
by Citi. Citi did not make, and was not provided with, an independent evaluation or appraisal of
TravelCenters’s assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and Citi did not make any physical inspection
of TravelCenters’s properties or assets. Citi’s opinion did not address the underlying business decisions of
TravelCenters to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business
strategies that might exist for TravelCenters or the effect of any other transaction in which TravelCenters
might engage. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi’s opinion did not address, (a) the fairness (financial
or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or

into in connection with the merger. Citi’s opinion was necessarily based upon information available to it, and
financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date of its written opinion.
Although subsequent developments could have affected Citi’s opinion had they taken place prior to the date
of its written opinion, Citi has no obligation to update, revise or affirm its opinion.
For a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Citi to TravelCenters Board in connection
with the delivery of Citi’s opinion, see the section entitled “- Summary of Material Financial Analyses”
beginning on page 42.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Citi to the TravelCenters
Board in connection with rendering its opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Citi, nor does the order of
analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Citi. Some of the
summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read
together with the full text of each summary and are, alone, not a complete description of the financial
analyses of Citi. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is
based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 15, 2023, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
The preparation of financial opinions is a complex process involving various determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, financial opinions are not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth below, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Citi’s
financial opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Citi considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Citi made its
determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the
results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the following analyses as a comparison is
directly comparable to TravelCenters or the merger.
Citi prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the TravelCenters Board as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than (i) BP and its affiliates, or (ii) RMR or any
entities managed by or that receive business management services from RMR, including SVC, or any of their
respective affiliates) of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, as of the date of the written
opinion, of the $86.00 in cash per share to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.
These analyses do not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of
TravelCenters, Citi, or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those forecasts.
The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between TravelCenters
and BP, rather than by Citi, and was approved by the TravelCenters Board. Citi provided advice to
TravelCenters during these negotiations. Citi did not, however, recommend any specific amount of
consideration to TravelCenters or the TravelCenters Board or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
As described above, the opinion of Citi to the TravelCenters Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the TravelCenters Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The
following summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Citi in
connection with its opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Citi’s written opinion attached as
Annex B.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Citi conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of TravelCenters using the Management Forecast.
Based on the Management Forecast, Citi calculated the estimated present value of unlevered free cash flows
43 
• 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
that TravelCenters was forecasted to generate during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 through
December 31, 2027 and both before and after taking into account the present value (as of December 31, 2022)
of cash tax savings resulting from net operating loss, referred to as “NOL”, carryforwards and U.S. federal
tax credits expected by TravelCenters management to be utilized during the forecast period. Stock-based
compensation was treated as a cash expense for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis. Citi also
derived implied terminal values for TravelCenters by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates
of (1.0)% to 1.0%, which range was selected by Citi based on its professional judgment and experience, to
estimates of the unlevered free cash flows that TravelCenters was expected to generate in the terminal year,
which such terminal year used EBITDA calculated assuming the average EBITDA margin in the period
beginning with the actual fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and ending with the forecasted fiscal year
ending December 31, 2027 applied to forecasted total revenue for forecasted fiscal year ending December 31,
2027, as advised by TravelCenters Management as a long-term assumption for such EBITDA margin. The
unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values reflecting
implied enterprise values for Travelcenters, as of December 31, 2022, using mid-year convention and
discount rates ranging from 12.3% to 13.9%, reflecting estimates of TravelCenters’s weighted average cost of
capital selected by Citi utilizing its professional judgment and experience, and calculated using a weighted-
average of the estimated cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt, assuming a range of target capital
structures of TravelCenters. From the range of implied enterprise values it derived for TravelCenters, Citi
subtracted TravelCenters’s net debt as of December 31, 2022 (calculated as total debt, less cash and cash
equivalents) to derive an equity value for TravelCenters and subsequently divided such equity value by
TravelCenters’s fully-diluted number of outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in an
implied share price.
For purposes of its analysis, Citi separately valued, as of December 31, 2022, TravelCenters’s (i) U.S.
federal NOL carryforwards, and (ii) U.S. federal tax credits, in each case, using estimates of tax cash savings
resulting from (i) and (ii) as provided by TravelCenters management for the fiscal years ending December 31,
2023 to December 31, 2027 and taking into account a U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21%, as provided by
TravelCenters management, and using a perpetual tax credit utilization range for the forecast period of $0
million to $1 million. All tax cash savings were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022
utilizing discount rates ranging from 12.3% to 13.9%, reflecting Citi estimates of TravelCenters’s weighted
average cost of capital and subsequently divided by TravelCenters’s fully-diluted number of outstanding
shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in an implied share price range for the value of such cash
tax savings.
This analysis indicated implied per share equity value reference ranges of $72.90 to $98.71 per share of
TravelCenters common stock without cash tax savings and $76.74 to $102.91 per share of TravelCenters
common stock with cash tax savings, which Citi compared to the merger consideration.
Selected Public Companies Analysis
Citi performed a selected public companies analysis, which is an analysis designed to estimate an
implied value of a company through an analysis of the public valuation and trading multiples of similar
publicly-traded companies. Citi reviewed financial and stock information of TravelCenters and the selected
publicly-traded companies described below, referred to as the “selected companies”, which are divided into
two separate categories: convenience stores, referred to as “C-Stores”, and traditional grocery stores,
referred to as “Traditional Grocery”. No publicly-traded company is identical to TravelCenters, but the
companies listed were selected because, among other reasons, they possessed certain financial, operational
or business characteristics that, in Citi’s view, based on its professional judgment and experience, were
sufficiently comparable to those of TravelCenters or otherwise relevant for purposes of comparison.
Citi selected the following C-Stores companies:
Alimentation Couche-Tard
Casey’s General Stores
Murphy USA
Citi selected the following Traditional Grocery companies:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Kroger

Albertsons Companies
Weis Markets
Ingles Markets
Citi calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on financial and trading data
as of February 15, 2023, information it obtained from TravelCenters management, with respect to
TravelCenters only, and Wall Street research, public filings and FactSet Research Systems, with respect to
TravelCenters and the selected companies. With respect to TravelCenters and the selected companies, Citi
calculated multiples of next twelve months, referred to as “NTM”, enterprise value to EBITDA, referred to as
“NTM EV/EBITDA” based on daily observations of the share prices (and using such observed share prices
to derive implied enterprise values) as well as the respective NTM EBITDA forecasts of TravelCenters and
the selected companies, over certain time periods ending February 15, 2023, whereby the multiples for the C-
Stores and the Traditional Grocery companies were aggregated by their respective peer group, resulting in
25  and 75  percentile of the NTM EV/EBITDA ranges based on the daily observations referenced above for
the five-year period ending February 15, 2023 for the C-Stores companies of 9.6x to 10.2x, and for the
Traditional Grocery companies of 5.2x to 6.1x.
Utilizing these 25  to 75  percentile ranges for the C-Stores and the Traditional Grocery companies, Citi
then subtracted the mean relative discount of TravelCenters’s observed NTM EV/EBITDA multiple over the
five-year period ending February 15, 2023 to the respective mean NTM EV/EBITDA multiple for the C-Stores
of 6.4x and Traditional Grocery companies of 2.1x over that same time period from the respective 25  to 75
percentile peer multiple ranges, resulting in an applied multiple range of 3.2x to 3.8x based on C-Stores
companies and 3.1x to 3.9x for the Traditional Grocery companies. Those applied multiple ranges for C-Stores
and Traditional Grocery companies were then multiplied by TravelCenters’s forecasted EBITDA for fiscal
year ending December 31, 2023, based on the Management Forecast, resulting in the implied enterprise
values for TravelCenters. Citi then deducted TravelCenters’s net debt from such implied enterprise values to
calculate implied equity values and divided such implied equity values by the fully-diluted number of
outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in the implied share price.
The results of this analysis indicated an implied share range of $62.65 to $76.55 based on the applied
trading multiple range of C-Store companies, and an implied share price range of $60.06 to $78.24 based on
the applied trading multiple range of the Traditional Grocery companies, which Citi compared to the merger
consideration.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Citi performed a selected transactions analysis for the Traditional Grocery companies, which is an
analysis designed to estimate an implied illustrative value of a company through an analysis of the multiples
paid in acquisitions of similar companies and businesses. Citi reviewed certain publicly available information
for selected transactions in the Traditional Grocery industry announced between 2019 and 2022, referred to
collectively as the “Traditional Grocery selected transactions”.
Although none of the target companies in the Traditional Grocery selected transactions are directly
comparable to TravelCenters and none of the Traditional Grocery selected transactions are directly
comparable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Traditional Grocery selected
transactions were chosen because they involved grocery stores with financial, operational or business
characteristics that, in Citi’s view, based on its professional judgment and experience, made them sufficiently
comparable to TravelCenters and/or the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement or otherwise
relevant for purposes of analysis. For each of the Traditional Grocery selected transactions, Citi reviewed the
enterprise value of the selected transaction as a multiple of the relevant target company’s last twelve months
EBITDA, referred to as “LTM EBITDA”, as of the time of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to
the close of the transaction. The Traditional Grocery selected transactions are set forth in the table below.

Based on its professional judgment and experience and taking into consideration the observed multiples
for the Traditional Grocery selected transactions, Citi then applied a reference range of multiples of 3.7x to
6.0x (reflecting the maximum and minimum enterprise value multiples of LTM EBITDA) to derive an implied
equity value per share for TravelCenters. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on public
filings and other information including FactSet Research Systems. Financial data of TravelCenters was based
on financial information provided by, and used by Citi at the direction of, TravelCenters management. Citi
then applied the 3.7x to 6.0x range of enterprise value multiples of LTM EBITDA to TravelCenters’s
forecasted EBITDA for fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 based on the Management Forecast, which Citi
determined, based on professional judgment and experience, was more representative of a normalized
profitability for TravelCenters than TravelCenters’s LTM EBITDA, to derive a range of implied enterprise
values for TravelCenters. Citi then deducted TravelCenters’s net debt from such implied enterprise value to
calculate an implied equity value and divided such implied equity value by the fully-diluted number of
outstanding shares of TravelCenters common stock, resulting in the implied share price.
The results of this analysis are below, which indicated an implied share price range of $73.57 to $124.01,
which Citi compared to the merger consideration.
Certain Additional Information
Citi also observed certain additional factors regarding TravelCenters that were not considered part of
Citi’s financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including
the following:
performed a selected transaction analysis for the C-Store companies for selected transactions in the
C-Store industry announced between 2018 and 2022, which indicated a low and high range of
enterprise value of the C-Store selected transactions as a multiple of the relevant target company’s
LTM EBITDA as of the time of the most recently completed quarter prior to the close of the respective
transaction of 7.1x to 13.7x, which further indicated an implied share price range of $148.12 to $294.33
based on the application of the 7.1x to 13.7x to TravelCenters’s forecasted EBITDA for fiscal year
ending December 31, 2023;
performed an analysis of all-cash consideration acquisition transactions announced during the time
period from January 1, 2018 through February 15, 2023 involving a U.S. public company as the target
where the disclosed enterprise values for such transactions were between $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion,
which indicated a 25  and 75  percentile premiums of the price paid in these transactions relative to
the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction of
19.6% and 69.2%, respectively, which further indicated an implied share price range of $59.15 to $83.65
based on the application of the 25  and 75  percentile premiums to the closing price per share of
TravelCenters common stock of $49.44 as of February 15, 2023; and
publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ price targets for TravelCenters, which indicated
standalone price targets of $60.00 to $85.00 per share of TravelCenters common stock.
Miscellaneous
Pursuant to an engagement letter between TravelCenters and Citi, TravelCenters has agreed to pay Citi
an aggregate fee of approximately $20 million, $2 million of which became payable upon Citi’s delivery of the
opinion described in this section and the remainder of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger.
TravelCenters also has agreed to reimburse Citi, subject to certain conditions, for reasonable expenses
incurred by Citi in performing its services, and to indemnify Citi and related persons against certain liabilities
arising out of its engagement.

As a matter of course, TravelCenters does not publicly disclose detailed long-term projections about its
future financial performance. However, in connection with the TravelCenters Board’s evaluation of a
potential transaction with BP and other potential strategic alternatives, TravelCenters management provided
the TravelCenters Board with certain non-public, unaudited and prospective financial information with
respect to TravelCenters’s prospective performance as a standalone going concern. We refer to these
projections as the Management Forecast and they were provided to TravelCenters Board and to Citi in
February 2023.
The Management Forecast reflects certain assumptions regarding, among other things, fuel and nonfuel
revenue, franchise royalties, operating expenses, selling and administrative expenses, capital expenditures,
net working capital, future acquisitions and cash taxes.

Additional Information Concerning the Financial Projections
The summary of the Management Forecast is included in this proxy statement to provide TravelCenters’
stockholders with access to certain financial projections that were made available to the TravelCenters Board
and its financial advisors. The Management Forecast was generated solely for internal use and not
developed with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial data or published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements or U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Management Forecast is a forward-looking
statement. The Management Forecast summarized in this section was prepared by TravelCenters’s
management.
The Management Forecast contains non-GAAP financial measures, including Total Site Level Operating
Expense (excl. Real Estate Rent Expense), 4-Wall EBITDAR, 4-Wall EBITDA, Total Corp. Level operating
expense (excl. depreciation and amortization), EBITDA, EBIT and Pre-Tax Book Income. TravelCenters’s
management included such measures in the Management Forecast because it believed that such measures
may be useful in evaluating, on a prospective basis, the potential operating performance and cash flow of
TravelCenters. TravelCenters’s management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful for
investors, taken in conjunction with TravelCenters’s GAAP financial statements, because they provide
greater transparency and period-over-period comparability with respect to TravelCenters’s operating
performance and can enhance investors’ ability to identify operating trends in TravelCenters’s business.
TravelCenters’s management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational
results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. A material limitation associated with the
use of the above non-GAAP financial measures is that they have no standardized measurement prescribed
by GAAP and may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Due to the forward-looking nature of the Management Forecast, specific quantification of the amounts that
would be required to reconcile the Management Forecast to GAAP measures are not available. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP. None of Total Site Level Operating Expense (excl. Real Estate Rent
Expense), 4-Wall EBITDAR, 4-Wall EBITDA, Total Corp. Level operating expense (excl. depreciation and
amortization), EBITDA, EBIT and Pre-Tax Book Income should be considered as an alternative to total
revenue, income from operations or net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance.
No independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any
procedures with respect to the Management Forecast or expressed any opinion or given any other form of
assurance with respect thereto, and no independent registered public accounting firm assumes any
responsibility for the information contained in the Management Forecast.
Neither TravelCenters nor any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made
or makes any representation to any security holder regarding the information included in the Management
Forecast or the ultimate performance of TravelCenters, BP, the surviving corporation or any of their affiliates
49 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
compared to the information contained in the Management Forecast. TravelCenters has made no
representation to BP or Merger Subsidiary, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the
Management Forecast.
The assumptions and estimates underlying the Management Forecast, all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond the control of TravelCenters, may not be realized as forecasted.
Actual results may differ materially from those reflected in the Management Forecast. In addition, the
Management Forecast will be affected by TravelCenters’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and
targets over the applicable period.
TravelCenters’s actual future financial results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by
the Management Forecast due to numerous factors, including many that are beyond TravelCenters’s ability
to control or predict. While presented with numerical specificity, the Management Forecast necessarily is
based on numerous assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of TravelCenters and difficult to
predict. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in the Management Forecast not being
achieved include, but are not limited to, the effect that customer demand, inflationary or recessionary
pressures on product, labor and operating costs, general economic conditions, geopolitical risks, competitive
conditions in our businesses, fuel market dynamics, war and other hostilities, supply chain challenges and
government regulation, among other factors, may negatively impact profitability, the successful integration
of acquired, developed or franchised locations into the network, the realization of expected benefits from
capital expenditures and other investments, the impact that continued improved fuel efficiency of motor
vehicle engines and other fuel conservation and alternative fuel practices could have on fuel volumes or
profitability, the effect that adverse weather events, natural disasters and climate change may have on
properties, operations or financial condition and other risk factors described in TravelCenters’s SEC filings,
including TravelCenters’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and described
under the section below entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”. The
Management Forecast also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions, industry conditions and
economic factors that are subject to change. The information set forth in the Management Forecast is not
fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results.
The Management Forecast was developed for TravelCenters based on TravelCenters’s continued
operation as a standalone, publicly traded company without giving effect to the merger, and therefore the
Management Forecast does not give effect to the merger or any changes to TravelCenters’s operations or
strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger, including potential cost synergies
to be realized as a result of the merger, or to any costs incurred in connection with the merger. Furthermore,
the Management Forecast does not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed
and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Management Forecast summarized in this section was prepared prior to the execution of the merger
agreement and has not been updated to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. TravelCenters
will not update or otherwise revise the Management Forecast hereafter to reflect circumstances arising after
their preparation.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecast, readers of
this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Management Forecast.",55,58

TravelCenters’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be deemed to
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of TravelCenters stockholders generally. The TravelCenters
Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing the
negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in
recommending that the merger be approved by TravelCenters stockholders.
If the proposal to approve the merger is approved by our stockholders and the merger closes, under the
terms of the merger agreement, any shares of TravelCenters common stock held by our directors and
executive officers will be treated in the same manner as issued and outstanding shares of TravelCenters
common stock held by all other TravelCenters stockholders entitled to receive the per share merger
consideration.
50 TABLE OF CONTENTS
TravelCenters Equity Awards
TravelCenters’s executive officers hold equity awards in the form of TravelCenters restricted shares. Mr.
Pertchik is our only director who holds TravelCenters equity awards, which he received in his capacity as an
employee of TravelCenters.
Restricted Shares
Each TravelCenters restricted share that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time will vest in full and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each
such TravelCenters restricted share will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (i) the
number of shares of TravelCenters common stock subject to each TravelCenters restricted share award,
multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration of $86.00. TravelCenters restricted shares will be treated
like all other shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the merger, as described under “- Certain
Effects of the Merger on TravelCenters” above. Payments in respect of TravelCenters equity awards will be
reduced by applicable tax withholding.
The following table sets forth the number of TravelCenters restricted shares that are unvested and the
cash amounts (on a pre-tax basis) that each TravelCenters executive officer is expected to receive in respect
thereof. The amounts listed in the table below are based on the number of unvested TravelCenters restricted
shares as of March 23, 2023 the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this
proxy statement, and exclude any additional grants that may be made, following such date, and assume a per
share merger consideration of $86.00. Depending on when the merger occurs, certain TravelCenters restricted
shares that are now unvested and included in the table below may vest or be forfeited in accordance with
their terms, independent of the merger.

Executive Arrangements
Each TravelCenters executive officer is party to an executive agreement that provides for certain
payments upon the consummation of the merger.
Executive Agreements for Messrs. Pertchik, Richards, Crage and Young
Each of Messrs. Pertchik, Richards, Crage and Young is a party to an executive agreement with
TravelCenters, pursuant to which they are entitled to receive, subject to the applicable executive officer
remaining employed by TravelCenters or one of its Subsidiaries as of the closing of the merger and executing
an effective release of claims, an amount in cash equal to (i) a retention bonus equal to the sum of the
executive officer’s base salary amount for the 2022 calendar year and annual bonus for the 2022 calendar
year (such annual bonus amount the “Annual Bonus”), which sum amounts to the following for each named
executive officer: $3,250,000 for Mr. Pertchik; $1,175,000 for Mr. Richards; $1,375,000 for Mr. Crage; and
$1,375,000 for Mr. Young and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the executive officer’s Annual Bonus (which Annual
Bonus is as follows for each named executive officer, assuming that they remain employed for the full
calendar year: $2,875,000 for Mr. Pertchik; $875,000 for Mr. Richards; $1,000,000 for Mr. Crage; and $1,000,000
for Mr. Young, determined by multiplying the Annual Bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the calendar year that elapsed prior to the closing of the merger and the denominator
of which is 365). These amounts will be paid, if at all, in a lump sum no more than sixty days following the
closing date of the merger, with the actual amount of the pro-rated portion of the Annual Bonus dependent
on when the closing date of the merger occurs.
For further information with respect to the arrangements between TravelCenters and its executive
officers, including a quantification of amounts payable under the Executive Agreements, see “Proposal 2:
Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page
86.
Benefit Arrangements
As described under “Employee Matters,” the merger agreement requires BP or the surviving corporation
to provide certain commitments regarding the value of compensation and benefits for twelve months
following the Effective Time to employees of TravelCenters or any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed
following the merger, including TravelCenters’s executive officers.
Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors and Executive Officers
As described under “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors
and Executive Officers,” during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and BP will cause the
surviving corporation and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons (as
defined below), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law in the event of any threatened or actual
52

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a “Claim”), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified
Person is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee) or officer of
TravelCenters, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors and (ii) any action or omission
(including the approval of the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby), or alleged
action or omission, occurring at or prior to the closing of the merger, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity
as a director or officer of TravelCenters, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors,
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such
threatened or actual Claim; provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced will provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. Neither BP nor the surviving corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification is being sought by an Indemnified
Person pursuant to the merger agreement, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such
Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). BP and the surviving corporation will cooperate
with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could seek
indemnification pursuant to the merger agreement.
At or prior to the Effective Time, TravelCenters will, or if TravelCenters is unable, BP will, or will cause
an affiliate or the surviving corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the
non-cancelable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of TravelCenters’s existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and TravelCenters’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies,
in each case for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the
approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby) with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under TravelCenters’s existing policies for the Indemnified Persons; provided that, in the event that
TravelCenters takes the foregoing actions, TravelCenters will, if appropriate, give BP a reasonable
opportunity to review such “tail” insurance policy and TravelCenters will give good-faith consideration to
any comments made by BP with respect thereto; and provided, further, that the aggregate cost for such “tail”
insurance policy will not exceed 300% of the amount TravelCenters paid in its last full fiscal year (such
maximum amount, the “Maximum Tail Premium”) and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policy exceeds the
Maximum Tail Premium, then TravelCenters will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.
If BP or the surviving corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and will not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
any of its property and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so
that the applicable successor, assign or transferee will assume these obligations.
These rights will survive consummation of the merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. These obligations of BP and the surviving corporation will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without
the consent of such Indemnified Person.",58,61

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger that may be relevant to U.S holders and Non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) of shares of
TravelCenters common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the
merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,
court decisions, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to
change or differing interpretations, at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or
differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion.
This discussion is limited to holders that hold their shares of TravelCenters common stock as “capital
assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This
summary does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign
tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g.,
state, gift or alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax). In addition, this
discussion does not address any considerations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or
practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). For purposes of this discussion, a “holder”
means either a U.S. holder or a Non-U.S. holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may require.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address nor does it purport to be
a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular
holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to holders subject to special rules under the
U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:
banks and other financial institutions;
mutual funds;
insurance companies;
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to
shares of common stock (by vote or value);
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental
organizations and pension funds;
holders that are holding shares of common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or
other integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S
corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in
such entities);

expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;
holders that are required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such
income being recognized on an “applicable financial statement”;
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
grantor trusts;
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
holders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax
qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
holders that own a direct or indirect equity interest in parent following the merger; and
holders that hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch
thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of TravelCenters common stock, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner,
the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partnership level.
Partnerships holding the shares of TravelCenters common stock and partners therein should consult their tax
advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements
made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will
agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in
the event of litigation.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY

• 
• 
SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.
U.S. Holders
This section applies to “U.S. holders”. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial
owner of shares of TravelCenters common stock who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of such trust and one (1) or more “United States persons”  (within the meaning of the
Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust validly
elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of TravelCenters common stock pursuant to
the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder will
recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding or transfer taxes) and the U.S.
55 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for the shares. A U.S. holder’s
gain or loss generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such U.S. holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the
merger. A preferential tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate
U.S. holder. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. A U.S. holder that holds different
blocks of common stock (shares of common stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different
prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules apply to them.
Non-U.S. Holders
This section applies to “Non-U.S. holders”. For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. holder”
means a beneficial owner of shares of TravelCenters common stock who or that is not a U.S. holder (and
excludes an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes).
Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized in connection with the merger, unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case
such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.
persons, and, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch
profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
such Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such
gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S.
holder; or
shares of TravelCenters common stock constitute a United States real property interest (a “USRPI”)
by reason of the Company’s status as a “United States real property holding corporation” as such
term is defined in the Code (a “USRPHC”) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period
preceding the merger and such Non-U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable
TravelCenters common stock (the “relevant period”), and, if TravelCenters common stock is regularly
traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder
owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of outstanding
TravelCenters common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the
first bullet above, except that the branch profits tax will not apply). Generally, a corporation is a
USRPHC if the fair market value of its USRPIs equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market
value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or
business. For this purpose, USRPIs generally include land, improvements and associated personal
property. There can be no assurances that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time
during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their
own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S.
holders and Non-U.S. holders in connection with the merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a
U.S. holder pursuant to the merger, unless the U.S. holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. holder’s correct taxpayer identification
number and certifying that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes
an exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding of tax may

TravelCenters of America Inc. MD_20230403_DEFM14A_20770239_4639300.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals for the Merger
The merger agreement generally requires each party to make appropriate filings required by antitrust
laws, to use its reasonable best efforts to comply with requests under applicable antitrust laws for additional
information from any governmental authority and to cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing, provided, that in no event will TravelCenters or any of its affiliates agree to any term, condition,
obligation, liability, requirement, limitation, qualification, remedy, commitment, sanction or other action in
connection with the expiration of any such waiting period or obtaining of any such consent, registration,
approval, permit or authorization that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement without the prior written consent of BP. The merger cannot be
completed until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has expired and any agreement between a
party to the merger agreement and a governmental authority not to consummate the merger has expired or
been terminated, and all other approvals under antitrust law have been received. Both TravelCenters and BP
filed notifications of the merger with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice under the
HSR Act on March 9, 2023. Accordingly, the initial waiting period will expire on April 10, 2023.
In furtherance of the foregoing, BP will (i) take any and all action necessary, including (A) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories
of assets or businesses of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries, (B) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries, (C)
terminating any venture or other arrangement, (D) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations
of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries or (E) effectuating any other change or restructuring
of TravelCenters or BP or their respective Subsidiaries or restricting TravelCenters or BP or their respective
Subsidiaries’ ability to operate their respective businesses (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with an Antitrust Authority) in
connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to TravelCenters or BP or
its or their businesses or assets by consenting to such action by TravelCenters and provided, that, any
Divestiture Action may, at the discretion of TravelCenters, be conditioned upon consummation of the merger
and to ensure that no governmental authority enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling or
injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the merger or to ensure that no
Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
merger, fails to do so by the end date; and (ii) not acquire by it or its affiliates of any interest in any person
that primarily derives revenues from lines of business in the United States similar to TravelCenters’s travel
centers, if such action would make it materially more likely that there would arise any impediments under any
antitrust law that may be asserted by any governmental authority to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby as soon as reasonably practicable.

Between March 24, 2023, and March 31, 2023, two complaints were filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York by purported stockholders of TravelCenters:
On March 24, 2023, a purported stockholder of TravelCenters named Ryan O’Dell filed a complaint
against TravelCenters and members of the TravelCenters Board in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. TravelCenters of America Inc., et al., Case No.
23-cv-02504.
Also on March 24, 2023, a purported stockholder of TravelCenters named Elaine Wang filed a
complaint against TravelCenters and members of the TravelCenters Board in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Wang v. TravelCenters of America Inc., et al.,
Case No. 23-cv-02529.
The two complaints filed in the above-referenced actions allege, among other things, that the
defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by omitting or
misrepresenting certain allegedly material information from the Schedule 14A filed in connection with the
merger. Those complaints allege that such omissions and misrepresentations rendered the Schedule 14A
false and misleading. We refer to the above-referenced actions collectively as the “Proxy Litigation.”
As of March 31, 2023, TravelCenters had also received two stockholder demand letters, which assert
that certain information allegedly omitted from the Schedule 14A should be disclosed.
TravelCenters believes the allegations and claims asserted in the Proxy Litigation and the stockholder
demand letter are without merit. TravelCenters denies that it has violated any laws or that TravelCenters or
any member of the TravelCenters Board breached any duties to the TravelCenters Stockholders.

The merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A, and this summary of its terms are
included to provide you with information regarding its terms. Factual disclosures about TravelCenters
contained in this proxy statement or in TravelCenters’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement,
update or modify the factual disclosures about TravelCenters contained in the merger agreement. Any
material facts in TravelCenters’s public reports previously filed with the SEC that are incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement that contradict the factual disclosures about TravelCenters contained in
the representations and warranties in the merger agreement will modify such factual disclosures. The
representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by TravelCenters, BP and Merger
Subsidiary were made solely to the parties to, and solely for the purposes of, the merger agreement and as of
specific dates and were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by TravelCenters, BP and
Merger Subsidiary in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your
review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this
summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the
principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the
right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be
untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the merger
agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject
to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports
and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by the matters contained in the company
disclosure schedule that TravelCenters provided to BP in connection with the merger agreement, which we
refer to as the disclosure schedule, which disclosures were not reflected in the merger agreement. Moreover,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the
date of the merger agreement. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or
any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts of TravelCenters, BP and Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates.",67,67

Effect on TravelCenters Common Stock
As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof:
each share of TravelCenters common stock owned by BP or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be canceled, and no payment will be made with respect thereto;
each share of TravelCenters common stock held by any Subsidiary of either TravelCenters or BP
(other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into such
number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the surviving corporation such that
each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the surviving corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of TravelCenters immediately prior to the Effective Time;
except as provided above, each share of TravelCenters common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to
$86.00, without interest; and
each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
surviving corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and,
together with the converted shares of TravelCenters common stock held by any Subsidiary of either
TravelCenters or BP (other than Merger Subsidiary) described above, will constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.
Treatment of TravelCenters Equity Awards
TravelCenters’s executive officers hold equity awards in the form of TravelCenters restricted shares. Mr.
Pertchik is our only director who holds TravelCenters equity awards in the form of TravelCenters restricted
shares, which he received in his capacity as an employee of TravelCenters or one of its Subsidiaries.

Restricted Shares
Each TravelCenters restricted share that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time will vest in full and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each
such TravelCenters restricted share will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (i) the
number of shares of TravelCenters common stock subject to each TravelCenters restricted share award,
multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration of $86.00. TravelCenters restricted shares will be treated
like all other shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the merger, as described under “- Certain
Effects of the Merger on TravelCenters” above. Payments in respect of TravelCenters equity awards will be
reduced by applicable tax withholding.",68,69

Prior to the Effective Time, BP will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to TravelCenters (the
“Paying Agent”) and enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company for the purpose of exchanging for the merger consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of TravelCenters common stock or (ii) uncertificated shares of TravelCenters common stock. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than five business days after the Effective Time), BP will send, or will
cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of TravelCenters common stock at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal (in a form that was reasonably acceptable to TravelCenters prior to the
Effective Time) and instructions (which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title
will pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates or transfer of the uncertificated shares to the Paying
Agent) for use in such exchange.
Each holder of shares of TravelCenters common stock that have been converted into the right to receive
the merger consideration will be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of a customary “agent’s message” by
the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of uncertificated shares, the merger consideration in respect of the
TravelCenters common stock represented by a certificate or uncertificated share. Upon such surrender of
certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, the certificates so surrendered will forthwith also be
cancelled. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such certificate or uncertificated
share will represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such merger
consideration. Immediately after the Effective Time, BP will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of TravelCenters common stock, cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate merger consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “payment fund”). The
payment fund will, pending its disbursement to the holders of TravelCenters common stock, be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by BP in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality
by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks reasonably acceptable to
TravelCenters; provided that no such investment or losses will affect the amounts payable to such holders
of TravelCenters common stock and BP will promptly replace or cause to be replaced any funds deposited
with the Paying Agent that are lost through any investment so as to ensure that the payment fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate merger consideration.
Earnings from investments, subject to the immediately preceding proviso, will be paid to and will be the sole
and exclusive property of BP or the surviving corporation, as directed by BP. Except as described below, the
payment fund will not be used for any other purpose.
If any portion of the merger consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered certificate or the transferred uncertificated share is registered, it will be a condition to such
payment that (i) either such certificate will be properly endorsed or will otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such uncertificated share will be properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment
will pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes or fees required as a result of such payment to a
person other than the registered holder of such certificate or uncertificated share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the merger or to
ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the

such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). BP and the surviving corporation will cooperate with an Indemnified
Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could seek indemnification pursuant
to the merger agreement.
At or prior to the Effective Time, TravelCenters will, or if TravelCenters is unable, BP will, or will cause
an affiliate or the surviving corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the
non-cancelable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of TravelCenters’s existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and TravelCenters’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies,
in each case for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the
approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby) with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under TravelCenters’s existing policies for the Indemnified Persons; provided that, in the event that
Company takes the foregoing actions, Company will, if appropriate, give BP a reasonable opportunity to
review such “tail” insurance policy and TravelCenters will give good-faith consideration to any comments
made by BP with respect thereto; and provided, further, that the aggregate cost for such “tail” insurance
policy will not exceed 300% of the amount TravelCenters paid in its last full fiscal year (such maximum
amount, the “Maximum Tail Premium”) and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policy exceeds the Maximum
Tail Premium, then TravelCenters will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.
If BP or the surviving corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and will not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
of its property and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that
the applicable successor, assign or transferee will assume these obligations.
These rights will survive consummation of the merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. These obligations of BP and the surviving corporation will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without
the consent of such Indemnified Person.",84,85

PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the
compensation for each named executive officer of TravelCenters that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC
disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable
to our named executive officers. The “golden parachute” compensation payable to these individuals is
subject to a non-binding advisory vote of TravelCenters’s stockholders, as described below in this section.
The estimated value of the payments and benefits that TravelCenters’s named executive officers will or
may be entitled to receive in connection with the merger is quantified below in accordance with Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the completion of the merger
occurred on March 23, 2023, the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, and exclude
any additional equity grants that may occur following such date, (ii) a per share cash merger consideration of
$86.00 and (iii) the number of unvested TravelCenters restricted shares held by each of the named executive
officers as of March 23, 2023, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this
proxy statement, and exclude any additional equity grants that may occur following such date. Depending on
when the merger occurs, certain equity awards that are now unvested and included in the table below may
vest or be forfeited pursuant to their terms, independent of the merger. In addition, the amounts indicated
below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect compensation actions that may occur
before completion of the merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts have been rounded to the
nearest whole dollar.

The estimated amounts shown in this column represent cash payments pursuant to each named
executive officer’s executive agreement with TravelCenters which are equal to (i) the sum of the named
executive officer’s base salary amount for the 2022 calendar year and annual bonus for the 2022 calendar
year (such annual bonus amount the “Annual Bonus”) and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the named
executive officer’s Annual Bonus, determined by multiplying the Annual Bonus by a fraction, the

PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the
compensation for each named executive officer of TravelCenters that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC
disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable
to our named executive officers. The “golden parachute” compensation payable to these individuals is
subject to a non-binding advisory vote of TravelCenters’s stockholders, as described below in this section.
The estimated value of the payments and benefits that TravelCenters’s named executive officers will or
may be entitled to receive in connection with the merger is quantified below in accordance with Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the completion of the merger
occurred on March 23, 2023, the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, and exclude
any additional equity grants that may occur following such date, (ii) a per share cash merger consideration of
$86.00 and (iii) the number of unvested TravelCenters restricted shares held by each of the named executive
officers as of March 23, 2023, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this
proxy statement, and exclude any additional equity grants that may occur following such date. Depending on
when the merger occurs, certain equity awards that are now unvested and included in the table below may
vest or be forfeited pursuant to their terms, independent of the merger. In addition, the amounts indicated
below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect compensation actions that may occur
before completion of the merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts have been rounded to the
nearest whole dollar.

The estimated amounts shown in this column represent cash payments pursuant to each named
executive officer’s executive agreement with TravelCenters which are equal to (i) the sum of the named
executive officer’s base salary amount for the 2022 calendar year and annual bonus for the 2022 calendar
year (such annual bonus amount the “Annual Bonus”) and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the named
executive officer’s Annual Bonus, determined by multiplying the Annual Bonus by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the calendar year that elapsed prior to the closing of
the merger and the denominator of which is 365), estimated assuming that the closing date of the merger
is March 23, 2023. For additional information, see “The Merger - Interests of Certain Directors and

Merger-Related Compensation Proposal
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, TravelCenters is seeking a
non-binding, advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of TravelCenters’s named executive
86 TABLE OF CONTENTS
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed above in this section. The proposal
gives TravelCenters’s stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related
compensation of TravelCenters’s named executive officers.
Accordingly, TravelCenters is requesting stockholders to adopt the following resolution, on a non-
binding, advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to TravelCenters’s
named executive officers, in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to
which such compensation will or may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K in “Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation
Arrangements” beginning on page 86 of this proxy statement, are hereby APPROVED.”
Vote Required and TravelCenters Board of Directors Recommendation
The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger.
Accordingly, you may vote not to approve this proposal on merger-related named executive officer
compensation and vote to approve the merger and vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature, it will
not be binding on TravelCenters, regardless of whether the merger is approved. Approval of the non-
binding, advisory proposal with respect to the compensation that will or may be received by TravelCenters’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger, and
failure to approve this advisory matter will have no effect on the vote to approve the merger. Because the
merger-related named executive officer compensation to be paid in connection with the merger is based on
contractual arrangements with the named executive officers and the merger agreement, such compensation
will or may be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the merger is approved (subject
only to the contractual conditions applicable thereto).
Approval of the advisory vote on the compensation that may be received by TravelCenters’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast.
THE TRAVELCENTERS BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR”
THE APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION THAT MAY BE PAID OR
BECOME PAYABLE TO TRAVELCENTERS’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER.

The Adjournment Proposal
We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting
to a later date or dates, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the
merger at the time of the Special Meeting. If our stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could
adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to
solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously
returned properly executed proxies voting against approving the merger. Among other things, approval of
the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number
of votes against approving the merger such that the proposal to approve the merger would be defeated, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the approval of the merger and seek to convince the
holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of approving the merger. Additionally, we
may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting.

Approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of votes cast.

with SVC, our agreement with RMR and our credit agreement contain provisions whereby our rights
under these agreements may be cancelled upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than
9.8% of our voting stock or upon other change in control events, as defined. If the violation of these
ownership limitations causes a lease or contract default, stockholders causing the default may become
liable to the Company or to other stockholders for damages. The ownership limitation in our charter and
bylaws helps facilitate our compliance with our contractual obligations with SVC to not take actions that

may conflict with SVC’s status as a REIT under the Code and is intended to help us preserve the tax
treatment of our net operating losses and other tax benefits. Our governing documents generally
provide that transfers of our shares to a person, entity or group that is then, or would become as a
result, an owner of 5% or more of our outstanding shares under applicable standards would be void in
total (or transferred to a trust) for transferees then already owning 5% or more of our shares, and for
transferees that would otherwise become owners of 5% or more of our shares, to the extent the transfer
would so result in such level of ownership by the proposed transferee and to the extent not approved

Members of the Board:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the
common stock of TravelCenters of America Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), of the Merger
Consideration (defined below) to be received by the holders of the common stock of the Company, pursuant
to the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) proposed to be entered into among the Company, BP Products North America Inc., a Maryland
corporation (“Parent”), and Bluestar RTM Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Subsidiary”). As more fully described in the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Subsidiary will
be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger, and (ii) each
outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Stock”)
(other than shares of the Company Stock held by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or held by any Subsidiary (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary)) will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated February 15, 2023 of the Merger Agreement and
held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of the
Company concerning the business, operations and prospects of the Company. We examined certain publicly
available business and financial information relating to the Company as well as certain financial forecasts
and other information and data relating to the Company which were provided to or discussed with us by the
management of the Company. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth in the Merger
Agreement in relation to, among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of the
Company Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of the Company; and the
capitalization and financial condition of the Company. We considered, to the extent publicly available, the
financial terms of certain other transactions which we considered relevant in evaluating the Merger and
analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of
other companies whose operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of the Company. In
connection with our engagement and at the direction of the Company and with the approval of Service
Properties Trust (“SVC”), the Company’s landlord for a substantial number of its properties pursuant to the
leases between the Company and SVC (collectively, the “SVC Leases”), which leases provide that the
Company’s rights and benefits under those agreements may be terminated in the event that the Company
experiences a change in control, as defined in the SVC Leases, we were requested to approach, and we held
discussions with, selected third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of the
Company. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered
such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at
our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our fairness opinion committee.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to",171,171

behalf has received a written, bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party (or a Group
of Third Parties) that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a

provided that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make such Adverse Recommendation Change

decision by the Board of Directors of the Company to take such action, (ii) during such Intervening Event
Notice Period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good-faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) at
the end of the Intervening Event Notice Period and prior to taking any such action, the Board of Directors of
the Company has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to amend this Agreement, and has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its duties under Applicable Law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect; provided,
further, that in the event the Intervening Event to which this provision applies thereafter changes in any
material respect, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.3(d) with respect to such new written notice, it being understood that the

complying with its disclosure obligations under Applicable Law or applicable rules of the Nasdaq, including
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e- 2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (or any
similar communication to stockholders), (ii) making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to
stockholders of the Company or (iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the

its duties); provided, in each case, that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an

Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action.

hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal) after receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Third Party (or a Group of Third Parties) making or submitting, and the material terms and conditions of, any
such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed promptly (but in no event later than
thirty-six (36) hours) after any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal and shall provide to Parent promptly (but in no event later than thirty-six (36) hours ) after receipt
thereof copies of all such written Acquisition Proposal, proposed transaction agreements or proposal letters
sent, made available or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (either directly or through its
Representatives) related to any Acquisition Proposal.
(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, in respect to a Superior Proposal received by the Company after the
date of this Agreement on an unsolicited basis, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in compliance with Section 10.1(d)(i) in order to enter into a
binding written definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; provided that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 6.3(g) until
and unless the Company has (A) provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
(such notice period on a consecutive basis, the “Superior Proposal Notice Period”) to the effect that the Board
of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) intends to take the actions described in clauses (i) or
(ii) of this Section 6.3(g), as the case may be, including the identity of the Third Party or Group of Third
Parties making such Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and full copies of all material relevant
agreements (including any related schedules, appendices, exhibits or other attachments) relating to such
Superior Proposal, including any financing commitments relating thereto; (B) prior to effecting such Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination, as the case may be, the Company and its Acquisition
Representatives, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, has been available to have negotiated with
Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need to
effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, as the case may be, and the Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed promptly of any material modifications to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that any change to the financial or other material terms of such proposal shall be deemed a
material modification); and (C) at the end of the Superior Proposal Notice Period and prior to taking any such
action, the Board of Directors of the Company has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to
make revisions to the terms of this Agreement, and has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its duties under Applicable Law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect; provided,
further, that in the event of any material modifications to such Superior Proposal (it being understood that
any change to the financial or other material terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification),
the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and comply with the requirements of
this Section 6.3(g) with respect to such new written notice, it being understood that the “Superior Proposal
Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will extend for the longer of two (2) Business Days until
or the end of the original Superior Proposal Notice Period.

provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive
or no standstill restriction, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended
to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such provision, as applicable.

(ii) “Superior Proposal” means a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach by
the Company of its obligations under this Section 6.3, if the transactions or series of related
transactions contemplated thereby were consummated would result in a Third Party or Group of Third
Parties, other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, beneficial ownership of, directly or indirectly,
holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Company Securities and Company
Subsidiary Securities, taken as a whole, or more than fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account all legal, regulatory, financial, timing, financing, the terms and conditions, likelihood
of consummation, and all other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, (A) would be more favorable to
the Company’s stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from a financial point of view (taking into account any written proposal by Parent to amend
or revise the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(g) and the time expected to be required to
consummate such Acquisition Proposal), (B) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, and (C) any other aspects considered relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company.

predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary under the comparable Employee
Plans) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, as applicable;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans nor post-retiree welfare benefits, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement or
post-retiree welfare benefits or to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits.

Time. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation

their respective subsidiaries divesting (by way of sale, separation or otherwise) any business or assets if the
aggregate annual revenues generated from such businesses or assets in 2022 exceeds $175,000,000.00 or (2)
otherwise take or commit to take any Divestiture Actions that together with actions in clause (1) would be
reasonably likely to result in a loss of aggregate annual revenues (expressed as a positive number) together

$175,000,000.00.

respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement and to

stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by Applicable Law. The Company shall (a) as

Westlake, OH 44145
Members of the Board:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the
common stock of TravelCenters of America Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), of the Merger
Consideration (defined below) to be received by the holders of the common stock of the Company, pursuant
to the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) proposed to be entered into among the Company, BP Products North America Inc., a Maryland
corporation (“Parent”), and Bluestar RTM Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Subsidiary”). As more fully described in the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Subsidiary will
be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger, and (ii) each
outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Stock”)
(other than shares of the Company Stock held by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or held by any Subsidiary (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary)) will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated February 15, 2023 of the Merger Agreement and
held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of the
Company concerning the business, operations and prospects of the Company. We examined certain publicly
available business and financial information relating to the Company as well as certain financial forecasts
and other information and data relating to the Company which were provided to or discussed with us by the
management of the Company. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth in the Merger
Agreement in relation to, among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of the
Company Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of the Company; and the
capitalization and financial condition of the Company. We considered, to the extent publicly available, the
financial terms of certain other transactions which we considered relevant in evaluating the Merger and
analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of
other companies whose operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of the Company. In
connection with our engagement and at the direction of the Company and with the approval of Service
Properties Trust (“SVC”), the Company’s landlord for a substantial number of its properties pursuant to the
leases between the Company and SVC (collectively, the “SVC Leases”), which leases provide that the
Company’s rights and benefits under those agreements may be terminated in the event that the Company
experiences a change in control, as defined in the SVC Leases, we were requested to approach, and we held
discussions with, selected third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of the
Company. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered
such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at
our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our fairness opinion committee.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to",167,171
