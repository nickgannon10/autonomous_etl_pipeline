On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub will merge with and into Univar Solutions,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Univar Solutions will be the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the
“Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, Univar Solutions will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Univar
Solutions common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, following the Merger it is expected that
Univar Solutions common stock will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange
Act”), and Univar Solutions will no longer file periodic or other reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer
to as the “SEC”). If the Merger is consummated, holders of Univar Solutions common stock will not own any shares of the capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Univar Solutions stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their demands for appraisal will
receive appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights.” The Merger will occur at such time as the certificate of merger meeting the requirements of

Treatment of Univar Solutions Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Univar Solutions, Merger Sub or the holders of any
securities of Univar Solutions or Merger Sub, each share of Univar Solutions common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as a
“share”), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Cancelled Shares, Owned Company Shares, Dissenting Shares
and shares covered by Univar Solutions Restricted Share Awards (each as defined below), will be converted automatically into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration of $36.15 per share in cash, without interest, subject to any required tax withholding.
Each share that is owned by Univar Solutions as treasury stock or otherwise or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time (in each case, other than any such shares held in a fiduciary,
 
-2-Table of Contents
representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties) (which we refer to collectively as the “Cancelled Shares”) will be cancelled and cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares that are owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (other than Merger Sub) or Univar Solutions (in each case, other than any such shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on
behalf of third parties) (which we refer to collectively as the “Owned Company Shares”), immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such person in the Surviving
Corporation will equal the ownership percentage of such shares represented immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, between March 13, 2023 and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions are changed into a different number of shares or
a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or similar event,
the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to proportionally reflect such change.
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have complied in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares and have not waived, effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under Delaware law with respect to such
shares (which we refer to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares”) will be cancelled and cease to exist and will not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time. Such stockholders instead will only be entitled to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of, and as provided by, Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Dissenting Share held by
stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have waived, withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal of such shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender in the manner provided for in the Merger Agreement. For more information, please refer to the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights.”
At or prior to the Closing (as defined below), Parent will cause to be deposited with a U.S. bank or trust company appointed by Parent and that
is reasonably acceptable to Univar Solutions to act as a paying agent (which we refer to as the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of
the shares (other than the Cancelled Shares and Owned Company Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
in exchange for all of the shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and Owned Company Shares),
payable upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares (which we refer to as “Certificates”)
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or noncertificated shares represented by book-entry (which we refer to as “Book-Entry Shares”)
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement (which cash we refer to as the “Exchange Fund”). For more information, please refer
to the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures.” 
Treatment of Univar Solutions Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted share award (which we refer to as a “Univar Solutions Restricted Share Award”),
performance-based restricted stock unit award (which we refer to as a “Univar Solutions PRSU Award”), restricted stock unit award other than a
Univar Solutions PRSU Award (which we refer to as a “Univar Solutions RSU Award”), deferred stock unit award (which we refer to as a “Univar
Solutions DSU Award”) and stock option (which we refer to as a “Univar Solutions Option”) will be cashed out based on the Merger Consideration,
less any required tax withholding and deductions and less the applicable per share exercise price in the case of a Univar Solutions Option, with the
number of Univar Solutions common stock to be cashed out for each Univar Solutions PRSU Award equal to: (A) for each such award granted in
2021, the

Effective Time occurs, (B) for each such award granted in 2022, the greater of (i) 150% of the target number of shares covered by the award and (ii)

The exchange of Univar Solutions common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who exchanges shares of Univar Solutions common stock for cash in the Merger
generally will recognize a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the
Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Univar Solutions common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. For more
information, please refer to the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.” 
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion does not
address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders
who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to
you of the Merger.

If the Merger is consummated, Univar Solutions stockholders who continuously hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock through the
Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw
their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Univar Solutions stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand
for appraisal, and follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the
fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each Univar Solutions stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the
entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Univar Solutions stockholders who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights.
Univar Solutions stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the
Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to Univar Solutions before the vote is taken on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue
to hold your shares of Univar Solutions common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for
exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may
result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger
unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Univar Solutions stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal
rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of Univar Solutions
common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you may make a written demand for
appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder
of record of the shares for which demand is made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a
brokerage or securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such shares confirming
such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at
which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified listed
required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the

In connection with the Merger Agreement, two complaints have been filed as individual actions in federal court. The complaints are captioned
O’Dell v. Univar Solutions Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-03314 (S.D.N.Y., April 20, 2023) and Wang v. Univar Solutions Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-03370
(S.D.N.Y., April 21, 2023) (collectively, the “Complaints”). In addition to the Complaints, on April 25, 2023, May 1, 2023 and May 2, 2023, purported
stockholders of the Company sent demand letters (the “Demands,” and together with the Complaints, the “Shareholder Actions”) in connection
with the Merger Agreement.
The Shareholder Actions generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on April 13, 2023 in connection with the
Merger Agreement (the “Preliminary Proxy”) misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The Shareholder Actions assert
violations of Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by the Company and the members of its Board of
Directors. The Shareholder Actions seek, among other things: to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement unless and until the purportedly material information omitted from the Preliminary Proxy is disclosed; rescission or rescissory damages in
the event the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated; direction for an accounting to the plaintiffs for all damages
suffered as a result of the purported wrongdoing; an award of costs and disbursements of the actions, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert
fees and expenses; and any other relief the court may deem just and proper.
The Company cannot predict the outcomes of the Shareholder Actions but believes that they are without merit. If additional similar complaints
are filed or demands are sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings or
demands.

General
Each of Parent and the Company has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts
to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with one another in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations or waiting periods from governmental entities as described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement— Regulatory Efforts and Related Matters.” These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act (as
defined below), CFIUS Approval (as defined below), and certain specific other filings and related approvals under the antitrust and foreign
investment laws of other jurisdictions as described further below.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is subject to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”). A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or
termination of a 30-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission
(which we refer to as the “FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”) issues a request for
additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the
parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second
Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. The parties made the required
filings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 27, 2023, and the initial 30-day waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 26, 2023.
At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking
to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate
assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion
of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws
under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
In addition, the Merger is subject to approval by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which we refer to as
“CFIUS”), which requires: (a) a written determination from CFIUS to the effect that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement do not
constitute a “covered transaction” pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 800.213, (b) a written determination from CFIUS to the effect that review or investigation
of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has been concluded and that a determination has been made that there are no
unresolved national security concerns and all action under the CFIUS laws has been concluded, or (c) following an investigation conducted by
CFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 800.507, CFIUS has reported the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to the President of the United
States and either (i) the President of the United States has made a decision not to suspend or prohibit such transactions pursuant to his authorities
under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, or (ii) the President of the United States has not taken any action within 15 days from the
date he received the report from CFIUS (which we refer to collectively as the “CFIUS Approval”). The parties submitted a draft notice to CFIUS on
March 30, 2023 and a formal notice on April 24, 2023.
 
-6-Table of Contents
Other Regulatory Clearances
In addition to HSR clearance and CFIUS Approval, the Merger is also subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain other
jurisdictions under their applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws. These include antitrust approvals in Brazil, Canada, China, the European
Union, Mexico and Turkey, as well as foreign investment approvals in France, Italy and Spain. Each of the foregoing filings, or drafts thereof, were
submitted to the relevant government authority on or before April 10, 2023. On April 24, 2023, the parties obtained clearance from the
Superintendency of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense in Brazil.
In each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the Merger or the applicable
waiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make
these filings as promptly as practicable. The relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they
deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, requiring the parties to license, or hold separate,
assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to commit to certain undertakings with respect to the
operations of the Parent or Company after the Closing.

This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This description does not
address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders
who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax
consequences to you of the Merger.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
 
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to
approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions
common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation
Proposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock representing a majority of the voting power present
in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is
required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Univar Solutions stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed proxy card; (b) grant
a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special
Meeting—Voting at the Special Meeting”); or (c) attend the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special
Meeting, for Univar Solutions stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, such abstention
will have the same effect as if the Univar Solutions stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal
and the Adjournment Proposal.
If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares (resulting in a so-called “broker non-votes”) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement
Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called “broker
non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules
provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter
and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. Univar Solutions does not expect any broker non-
votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority
to vote on proposals that are considered “routine,” and each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered “non-routine.”
As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Univar Solutions common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving
instructions. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal;
and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
What constitutes a quorum?
 
A:
The presence, in person or by proxy (including solely by means of remote communication) of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of
the Univar Solutions common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.
Because there were 157,741,392 shares of Univar Solutions common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the Record Date, we will need
holders of at least 78,870,697 shares present in person or by proxy (including solely by
 
-17-
Table of Contents
means of remote communication) at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is
expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
 
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Univar Solutions stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Univar Solutions
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Univar Solutions common stock. Instead, Univar Solutions will remain an independent
public company, Univar Solutions common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and
Univar Solutions will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Univar Solutions will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of
$204,190,000, or Parent will be required to pay Univar Solutions a termination fee of $291,690,000 or $379,200,000, as described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.” 
 
Q:
Why are Univar Solutions stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?
 
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Univar Solutions to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote with respect to certain
payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
 
Q:
What will happen if Univar Solutions stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is
an advisory vote and will not be binding on Univar Solutions. Therefore, if the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the
Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Univar Solutions’ named executive
officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
 
Q:
What do I need to do now?
 
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along
with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and
how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or
grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares
in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
 
Q:
Should I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?
 
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will send each holder of record of an outstanding certificate a letter of transmittal and
instructions that explain how to exchange shares of Univar Solutions common stock represented by such holder’s certificates for the Merger
Consideration. Also after the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will send each holder of uncertificated shares represented by book entry the
Merger Consideration for each such book-entry share upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request).

Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Univar Solutions common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you
sell or transfer your shares of Univar Solutions common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements
(such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies
Univar Solutions in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed,
to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares of Univar Solutions common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the
instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting at the Special Meeting”).
 
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a Univar Solutions stockholder of record and holding shares in “street name” as a beneficial
owner?
 
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Univar Solutions’ transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered a stockholder
of record with respect to these shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Univar Solutions.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are often said to hold these shares in “street name” and are considered
“beneficial owners” of those shares. In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the Univar Solutions stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct
your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the virtual
Special Meeting.
 
Q:
How may I vote?
 
A:
There are three ways to vote before the meeting if you are a record holder (i.e., you do not hold your shares through a broker, bank or other
nominee):
 
•
By Internet: If you have Internet access, the Board of Directors encourages you to vote at www.proxydocs.com/unvr by following the
instructions on the proxy card;
 
•
By Telephone: As instructed on the proxy card, by making a toll-free telephone call from the U.S. or Canada to 1 (866) 895-6933; or
 
•
By Mail: If you received your proxy materials by mail, you can vote by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the
prepaid envelope provided.
You can also vote at the virtual Special Meeting, which will be held on June 6, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time at www.proxydocs.com/unvr (unless
the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed).
If you hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock as a beneficial owner in “street name” as of the Record Date, (i) you will receive separate
instructions from your bank, broker, or other nominee describing how to vote your shares; and (ii) if you want to vote during the virtual meeting,
you must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker, or other nominee and also register at www.proxydocs.com/unvr. You will need the unique
control number which appears on the instructions that accompanied the proxy card you previously received. You may be required to submit a copy
of your legal proxy and should follow the instructions provided in the email that you receive upon completing your registration.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. We
encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, 
 
-19-
Table of Contents
both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still attend the Special Meeting
and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your
proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
 
Q:
What is a proxy?
 
A:
A proxy is a Univar Solutions stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such Univar Solutions stockholder on
their behalf. If you are a Univar Solutions stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
 
Q:
If a Univar Solutions stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you
voted against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
 
A:
Yes. You may change your vote at any time before the polls close at the Special Meeting. You may do this by:
 
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to Univar Solutions prior to the Special Meeting;
 
•
assuming you have registered and are a record holder, attending the Special Meeting and voting in that forum; or
 
•
voting again by telephone or the Internet prior to the start of the Special Meeting.
Your attendance at the Special Meeting will not have the effect of revoking a proxy unless you notify the Secretary of Univar Solutions in writing at
3075 Highland Parkway, Suite 200, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515 before the polls close that you wish to revoke a previous proxy.
If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the voting instructions you receive from the holder of
record to revoke your proxy or change your vote or, if you have obtained a legal proxy, by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person
virtually.

Banks and brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833 
 
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 
A:
This means you own shares of Univar Solutions common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For
example, you may own some shares directly as a Univar Solutions stockholder of record and other shares through a broker, or you may own shares
through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy
cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares
you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each
proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
 
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another Univar Solutions
stockholder?
 
A:
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with
respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for
companies. Univar Solutions and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple stockholders sharing an
address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or
Univar Solutions that they or Univar Solutions will be sending householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are
notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a
separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if
your shares are held in a brokerage account or Univar Solutions if you hold registered shares. You can notify Univar Solutions by sending a
request to Univar Solutions Inc., c/o Investor Relations, 3075 Highland Parkway, Suite 200, Downers Grove, Illinois, 60515 or by calling 1-844-632-
1060, and Univar Solutions will promptly deliver to you a separate copy of the proxy statement.
 
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In addition, within four business days
following certification of the final voting results, Univar Solutions will file the final voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting
results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
 
A:
Univar Solutions has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated, which we refer to as “Innisfree,” to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special
Meeting. Univar Solutions estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $35,000 plus an additional fee per call made or received, plus
reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Univar Solutions has agreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and
expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
 
-21-
Table of Contents
Univar Solutions can use directors, officers and regular employees of Univar Solutions to ask for proxies. These employees do not receive
additional compensation for these services. Univar Solutions may reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of Univar Solutions’ common stock.
 
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 
A:
We currently expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted
because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which
are outside of our control.
 
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about Univar Solutions?
 
A:
Univar Solutions will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2023 Annual Report to Stockholders,
including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (which we refer to as “Annual Report”), without charge to
any Univar Solutions stockholder who makes a request in writing to our Secretary at Univar Solutions Inc., c/o Investor Relations, 3075 Highland
Parkway, Suite 200, Downers Grove, Illinois, 60515. In order for you to receive timely delivery of documents in advance of the Special Meeting, you
must make such request by no later than May 30, 2023. Univar Solutions’ Annual Report and other SEC filings may also be accessed at

approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, 78,870,697 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions
common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Univar Solutions stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock representing a majority of the
voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Compensation
Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person,
or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of
the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Univar Solutions stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed proxy card; (b) grant
a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “ — Voting at the
Special Meeting”); or (c) attend the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but will have no
effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, for Univar Solutions stockholders who
attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, such abstention will have the same effect as if the Univar Solutions
stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no
effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, because broker non-votes will not be counted as shares present and entitled to vote
with respect to proposals on which the broker has not voted. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a
valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of
such shares. Univar Solutions does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other
nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine,” and each of the proposals to be
presented at the Special Meeting is considered “non-routine.” As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Univar Solutions common
stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

There are three ways to vote before the meeting if you are a record holder (i.e., you do not hold your shares through a broker, bank or other
nominee):
 
•
By Internet: If you have Internet access, the Board of Directors encourages you to vote at www.proxydocs.com/unvr by following the
instructions on the proxy card;
 
•
By Telephone: As instructed on the proxy card, by making a toll-free telephone call from the U.S. or Canada to 1 (866) 895-6933; or
 
•
By Mail: If you received your proxy materials by mail, you can vote by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the
prepaid envelope provided.
You can also vote at the virtual Special Meeting, which will be held on June 6, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time at www.proxydocs.com/unvr (unless
the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed).
Although Univar Solutions offers multiple voting methods, Univar Solutions encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as Univar
Solutions believes they are the most cost-effective methods. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend
the Special Meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective and reliable
alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over the Internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to submit
your proxy card by mail.
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received by the deadline indicated above will be voted at the Special Meeting in
accordance with the instructions of the Univar Solutions stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be
voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you indicate on
your proxy card that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal or the
Compensation Proposal, your shares of Univar Solutions common stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a
signature will not be counted as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be voted.
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Univar Solutions’ transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered a stockholder
of record with respect to those shares. Some stockholders hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock through a bank, broker, or other nominee, and
are often said to hold those shares in “street name.” These stockholders are considered “beneficial owners” of those shares. If you hold shares of Univar
Solutions common stock as a beneficial owner in “street name” as of the Record Date, (i) you will receive separate instructions from your bank, broker, or
other nominee describing how to vote your shares; and (ii) if you want to vote during the virtual meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your bank,
broker, or other nominee and also register at www.proxydocs.com/unvr. You will need the unique control number which appears on the instructions that
accompanied the proxy card you previously received. You may be required to
 
-27-Table of Contents
submit a copy of your legal proxy and should follow the instructions provided in the email that you receive upon completing your registration. If you do
not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if
possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal
but, assuming a quorum is present, will not have any effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (so long as you do not attend
the Special Meeting and abstain from voting on any given proposal, which would have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement
Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and/or the Adjournment Proposal, as applicable).

Any proxy given by a Univar Solutions stockholder may be revoked before the Special Meeting by doing any of the following:
 
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to Univar Solutions prior to the Special Meeting;
 
•
assuming you have registered and are a record holder, attending the Special Meeting and voting in that forum; or
 
•
voting again by telephone or the Internet prior to the start of the Special Meeting.
Your attendance at the Special Meeting will not have the effect of revoking a proxy unless you notify the Secretary of Univar Solutions in writing at

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, Univar Solutions stockholders who continuously hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock through the
Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262
of the DGCL. This means that Univar Solutions stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and
follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each Univar Solutions stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal
proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Univar Solutions stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to
review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Univar Solutions stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger
Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to Univar Solutions before the vote is taken on the adoption
of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your
shares of Univar Solutions common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership
conditions are satisfied by the Univar Solutions stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its
entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed

respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process,
which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Univar
Solutions and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple stockholders sharing an address, unless contrary
instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or Univar Solutions that they or Univar
Solutions will be sending householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your
consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving

As part of Univar Solutions’ ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and Univar
Solutions’ management periodically review, consider and assess Univar Solutions’ operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry
conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for
business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, as compared to the benefits and risks of continued operation as a
stand-alone, publicly traded company, and have sometimes included outside financial and legal advisors. Such reviews have been accompanied by
periodic conversations between senior executives or members of the Board of Directors of Univar Solutions and their counterparts at other companies
regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.
On October 29, 2022, a representative of Brenntag, a global chemicals distribution company, contacted Mr. Christopher D. Pappas, the Company’s
Chairperson, to schedule time to speak about Brenntag’s views on Univar Solutions and other potential opportunities. Following that outreach, on
November 13, 2022, the representative of Brenntag and Mr. Pappas spoke telephonically. During the meeting, the representative from Brenntag inquired if
Univar Solutions would consider an offer to acquire the Company. Mr. Pappas responded that he would bring any proposal provided by Brenntag to

On November 14, 2022, Brenntag provided an initial offer letter to Mr. Pappas containing a nonbinding proposal to acquire 100% of the Company’s
issued and outstanding shares of common stock for $37.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “November 14
Brenntag Proposal”), which proposal represented a 46% premium over the 30-day volume-weighted average share price of $25.70 and a 27% premium over
Univar Solutions’ closing share price of $29.50 on November 11, 2022, the last trading date prior to the November 14 Brenntag Proposal. The offer letter
stated that its submission had received all internal approvals necessary to submit the nonbinding proposal. The offer letter further noted that the
November 14 Brenntag Proposal was subject to confirmatory due diligence and that Brenntag had conducted regulatory analysis and was confident the
transaction could obtain required approvals in a timely manner. The November 14 Brenntag Proposal did not include any proposed commitments by
Brenntag with respect to regulatory efforts that Brenntag would agree to undertake to consummate a transaction. Mr. Pappas promptly shared the
November 14 Brenntag Proposal with the Board of Directors.
On November 16, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of Univar Solutions’
management, representatives of Univar Solutions’ financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, and representatives of Univar Solutions’

with Brenntag, including the November 13, 2022, discussion and November 14 Brenntag Proposal. A representative of Wachtell Lipton provided an
overview of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Univar Solutions.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank discussed with the members of the Board of Directors the current market landscape and Univar
Solutions’ historical performance based on publicly available information and information provided by Univar Solutions’ management. Representatives of
Wachtell Lipton reviewed the potential regulatory approval process that would be required to consummate a transaction with Brenntag, as well as the
feasibility and likely timing of such approvals, and the risk to Univar Solutions related to such approvals. The Board of Directors proposed to meet again
on November 20, 2022, to discuss further the proposal. Members of Univar Solutions’ management also discussed the Company’s recent performance in
the context of Univar Solutions’ strategic plan, and directed that the Univar LRSP, as defined and described in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“—Certain Financial Projections”, be used by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank in preparing their financial analysis with respect to Univar Solutions
and any potential transaction.
Following the meeting of the Board of Directors on November 16, 2022, the Board of Directors determined to retain Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
Bank as financial advisors to Univar Solutions and its Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the November 14 Brenntag Proposal,
including the evaluation of potential alternatives. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank were selected based on their qualifications, expertise and reputation
in the chemicals industry and their knowledge of the business and affairs of Univar Solutions. Prior to their engagement, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
Bank provided disclosure regarding their relationships with Univar Solutions and Brenntag.
On November 20, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar
Solutions’ management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
Bank each independently reviewed with the Board of Directors preliminary financial information relating to the November 14 Brenntag Proposal, based on
the Univar LRSP. The Board of Directors discussed the potential valuation of Univar Solutions that could be achieved upon the successful execution of
Univar Solutions’ business plan and the expected regulatory approvals required for a transaction with Brenntag and the likelihood that a transaction with
Brenntag would be completed, and the commitments that might be required from various regulators to obtain such approvals. In light of Brenntag’s
significant competitive overlap with Univar Solutions, Univar Solutions’ management and Board of Directors determined that greater clarity with respect
to the extent of Brenntag’s commitment to obtain the required regulatory approvals for a transaction should be obtained before providing Brenntag with
access to due diligence information with respect to Univar Solutions. Following the discussion, the Board of Directors directed Univar Solutions to
respond to the Brenntag’s offer to seek a higher price per share and greater regulatory certainty.

On November 22, 2022, Mr. Pappas and David Jukes, the Chief Executive Officer of Univar Solutions, met virtually with representatives of Brenntag.
Mr. Pappas and Mr. Jukes informed the representatives of Brenntag that the November 14 Brenntag Proposal was insufficient, taking into account the
views of the Board of Directors as to what Brenntag would reasonably be capable of paying (including a fair allocation of value from potential synergies)
and the risk to Univar Solutions, regulatory and otherwise, entailed in a potential transaction with Brenntag, and that Univar Solutions would require a
more detailed and substantial regulatory commitment prior to providing due diligence with respect to Univar Solutions and its business, but that Univar
Solutions was willing to enter into discussions with Brenntag, subject to the receipt of a revised proposal acceptable to the Board of Directors and
execution of a customary confidentiality agreement.
On November 25, 2022, Bloomberg News published an article online indicating that the Company was attracting takeover interest from Brenntag. In
response, Brenntag confirmed it was in preliminary discussions with Univar Solutions. Later in the evening of November 25, 2022, Univar Solutions
issued a statement confirming receipt of a preliminary indication of interest from Brenntag. On November 23, 2022, the last trading date that closed prior to
the publication of the Bloomberg News article, the closing price for shares of Univar Solutions common stock was $31.02.
On November 26, 2022, Brenntag provided an updated offer letter to Univar Solutions containing a nonbinding proposal to acquire 100% of the
Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock for $40.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash (which we refer to as the
“November 26 Brenntag Proposal”), which proposal represented a 50% premium over the 30-day volume-weighted average share price of $27.04 and a
35% premium over Univar Solutions’ closing share price of $29.97 on November 22, 2022, the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public
confirmation of Brenntag’s approach. The letter noted that the other terms and conditions of the November 14 Brenntag Proposal remained in effect, and
that the proposal was conditioned on full and satisfactory access to due diligence and a mutually acceptable approach on regulatory approvals. The
November 26 Brenntag Proposal did not include any additional details with respect to the regulatory commitments that Brenntag would be willing to make
in connection with any transaction.
On November 27, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, to discuss the November 26 Brenntag Proposal,
with the participation of members of Univar Solutions’ management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton.
Following a brief review of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, under Delaware law, the representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided an
overview of a suggested response that had been developed by Univar Solutions’ financial and legal advisors, noting that it aligned with the prior
guidance from the Board of Directors on requirements for access to diligence, including an expectation that Brenntag would further increase its offer
following due diligence, and that Brenntag make substantial commitments regarding regulatory efforts, potential termination fees and its obligation to
litigate against any regulatory challenges as a pre-condition to gaining access to diligence. Members of the Board of Directors further discussed the
proposal and potential responses, including in the context of Univar Solutions’ stand-alone plan, and potential acquirors identified by the Company’s
financial advisors, including the attractiveness of the Company to potential financial acquirors. The Board of Directors directed representatives of the
Company, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton to respond to Brenntag’s revised offer and provide limited access to due diligence
materials and to coordinate outreach to other potential acquirors.
On November 27, 2022, representatives of Univar Solutions contacted representatives of Brenntag to request a revised offer letter reflecting the
requirements specified in the proposed framework approved by the Board of Directors, including regarding the need for the strongest possible
commitment with respect to regulatory efforts, a substantial reverse termination fee and Brenntag’s obligation to litigate any regulatory challenges if
regulators objected to the potential transaction.
Additionally, between November 27, 2022, and December 3, 2022, Univar Solutions and Brenntag and their representatives negotiated the terms of a
confidentiality agreement and related clean team agreement. On

December 3, 2022, Univar Solutions and Brenntag entered into a confidentiality agreement, which included a customary standstill provision. The
standstill provision of the confidentiality agreement included a customary fall-away and permits proposals to be communicated confidentially to Univar
Solutions’ chief executive officer and Board of Directors. Thereafter, Univar Solutions and its representatives provided limited historical non-public due
diligence information to certain clean team representatives of Brenntag to assist in Brenntag’s regulatory analysis, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton
engaged in calls with such representatives of Brenntag discussing matters related to that analysis. Throughout the month of December, representatives
of Wachtell Lipton provided data and information on Univar Solutions, as well as industry data and information, to representatives of Brenntag’s outside
counsel pursuant to the clean team agreement for the purpose of better evaluating the regulatory risk presented by a potential transaction.
Following the November 27, 2022 Board meeting, as directed by the Board of Directors, representatives from Univar Solutions, Goldman Sachs and
Deutsche Bank spoke telephonically, in person and virtually with 12 financial sponsors to assess their interest in a potential acquisition of or strategic
transaction involving Univar Solutions. In addition, representatives of Univar Solutions, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank responded to four inbound
inquiries from additional potential counterparties. Over the next several weeks, in addition to formal meetings of the Board of Directors, Mr. Pappas and
members of the Company’s senior management periodically briefed and received input from members of the Board of Directors as to the discussions with
representatives of certain of the potential acquirors.
On November 29, 2022, Mr. Pappas had a telephonic discussion with a partner at Apollo to discuss whether Apollo would be interested in exploring
a potential acquisition of the Company, who indicated Apollo would be interested in a potential transaction. Also on November 29, 2022, Brenntag sent
Univar Solutions a revised letter (which we refer to as the “November 29 Brenntag Letter”) noting that it was not certain it could support any further price
increases and that it was committed to working towards determining a regulatory framework that would lead to a successful closing, but that it needed
additional diligence before it could provide clarity on its regulatory commitments.
On December 1, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of Univar Solutions’
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. The Board of Directors discussed recent developments,
summarized the status of discussions with Brenntag and outreach to financial sponsors that Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank had identified and other
potentially interested parties. The Board of Directors discussed the November 29 Brenntag Letter and potential responses, including in the context of
Univar Solutions’ stand-alone plan and maintaining competitive pressure on Brenntag and other potentially interested parties. After this discussion, the
Board of Directors directed management, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to seek commitments from Brenntag regarding regulatory efforts, potential
termination fees, and its obligation to litigate as a pre-condition to gaining additional access to diligence, and continue outreach to and, subject to
execution of a confidentiality agreement, provide due diligence to, other potential acquirors.
On December 1, 2022, representatives of Univar Solutions requested that representatives of Brenntag provide a revised offer letter reflecting the
proposed regulatory framework and expedited timeline and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Brenntag’s legal counsel had a telephonic discussion
regarding these topics.

December 8, 2022, Univar Solutions and Apollo negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Apollo’s
outside legal counsel, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), participating in such negotiations. On December 8, 2022, Univar
Solutions and Apollo entered into a confidentiality agreement containing a customary standstill and standstill fall-away and permitting Apollo to make

person on December 20, 2022 if satisfactory progress on regulatory issues and related workstreams had been achieved so as to justify more expansive
diligence. Also on December 9, 2022, representatives from Goldman Sachs had discussions with representatives from Apollo regarding the scheduling of

Brenntag.
Also on December 20, 2022, Primestone Capital LLP (which we refer to as “Primestone Capital”) publicly released a letter identifying itself as a

On December 23, 2022, Apollo provided an initial offer letter to representatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank containing a nonbinding
indication of interest to acquire 100% of Univar Solutions for $36.00 to $38.00 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash (which we refer to as
the “Apollo December Proposal”), which proposal represented a 33-41% premium over the 30-day volume-weighted average share price of $27.04 and a
20-27% premium over Univar Solutions’ closing share price of $29.97 on November 22, 2022, the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of
public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach. The Apollo December Proposal noted, among other things, that Apollo’s proposal was subject to the
satisfactory completion of focused due diligence. The Apollo December Proposal also stated that Apollo’s funds had the ability to fund 100% of the
equity requirements for its proposed transaction, but that the offer was contingent on receipt of committed debt financing, and that the submission of the
nonbinding indication of interest had been reviewed with Apollo’s investment committee but would require final investment committee approval. The
Apollo December Proposal was promptly shared with the Board of Directors.
Also on December 23, 2022, Sponsor A provided an initial offer letter to representatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank containing a
nonbinding indication of interest to acquire 100% of the fully diluted shares outstanding of Univar Solutions for $37.00 to $39.00 per share of Univar
Solutions common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “Sponsor A December Proposal”), which proposal represented a 37-44% premium over the 30-
day volume-weighted average share price of $27.04 and a 23-30% premium over Univar Solutions’ closing share price of $29.97 on November 22, 2022, the
last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach. The Sponsor A December Proposal noted, among other
things, that Sponsor A’s proposal was subject to the satisfactory completion of customary due diligence. The Sponsor A December Proposal also stated
that Sponsor A’s funds and select co-investors would fund the equity requirements for the transaction, but that it would require additional debt
financing, and that the proposed transaction and the resources required to conduct due diligence had been reviewed internally at Sponsor A and
approved. The Sponsor A December Proposal was promptly shared with the Board of Directors.
On December 28, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar
Solutions’ management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche

Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Pappas and representatives from Goldman Sachs guided a discussion about recent developments, including the status of
discussions with Brenntag, in particular with respect to the continued lack of clarity on regulatory commitments by Brenntag, the provision of diligence
and confidential information to Brenntag, and expected in-person meetings between representatives of Univar Solutions and representatives of Brenntag
in January 2023. The representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank reviewed with the Board of Directors preliminary financial information
regarding the indications of interest from Apollo and Sponsor A, including how the Sponsor A December Proposal and Apollo December Proposal
compared to Brenntag’s proposals. The representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank also provided an overview of key sponsor due diligence
requests.
Following the presentations by Univar Solutions’ advisors, the Board of Directors discussed the Sponsor A December Proposal, Apollo December
Proposal and status of Brenntag’s proposal, and how best to proceed with respect to such proposals. In addition, the Board of Directors discussed (i) the
status of equity and debt financing with respect to Apollo and Sponsor A, including Apollo’s ability to finance the full equity amount of its proposal, (ii)
the state of the U.S. leveraged financing market and whether the proposal contained in the Sponsor A December Proposal and Apollo December Proposal
were likely to be actionable in light of the then-current market conditions, (iii) feedback from other potential acquirors contacted by Goldman Sachs and
Deutsche Bank, who had reached out to Univar Solutions, and who had elected not to submit an offer, (iv) the potential valuation of Univar Solutions
that could be achieved upon the successful execution of Univar Solutions’ stand-alone business plan as a publicly traded company relative to the
consideration proposed in each of the proposals, including risks related to Univar Solutions’ ability to execute successfully on its business plan, and how
to maximize the offer prices in the proposals and (v) the importance of Brenntag’s willingness to agree to regulatory commitments that would provide
Univar Solutions with sufficient confidence in the consummation of a transaction with Brenntag.
Following this discussion, the Board of Directors directed Univar Solutions’ management, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton,
following the receipt of Brenntag’s regulatory proposal, to provide access to appropriate due diligence, based upon the strength of the regulatory
proposal, and to continue to engage with Apollo and Sponsor A and provide access to due diligence to Apollo and Sponsor A.
Following the meeting of the Board of Directors, on the evening of December 28, 2022, Brenntag’s legal counsel and financial advisors engaged in
discussion virtually with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton regarding the terms of Brenntag’s updated proposal
(the “December 28 Brenntag Proposal”). Brenntag proposed a purchase price of $40.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash (as in the
November 26 Brenntag Proposal) and regulatory commitments that Brenntag was willing to agree to, including a commitment to litigate, in each case
subject to final confirmation by its supervisory board. Based on that day’s discussions with the Board of Directors, representatives from Goldman Sachs,
Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton indicated that the proposed regulatory commitment in the December 28 Brenntag Proposal was below the
expectations of the Board of Directors and that they would discuss the proposal further with Univar Solutions.
On the morning of December 29, 2022, Mr. Pappas and members of management of Univar Solutions discussed the December 28 Brenntag Proposal
with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Based on the direction of the Board of Directors, at the meeting of the
Board of Directors on December 28, 2022, management, with assistance from the advisors, prepared a response to the December 28 Brenntag Proposal,
indicating that the regulatory commitments were inadequate in terms of providing sufficient certainty of closing but that Univar Solutions would maintain
the January meeting date and provide access to certain information in a confidential data room (the “Data Room”). However, Univar Solutions requested
that prior to the January meeting, Brenntag affirm the continued support for the proposed transaction by Brenntag’s supervisory board. Mr. Pappas, the
members of management of Univar Solutions and the representatives from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton also prepared responses
to Apollo and Sponsor A regarding their bids, indicating that the Board of Directors would be willing to consider the proposals, but would expect the
 
-39-

applicable bidder to work rapidly towards a potential signing. Following the meeting, Mr. Pappas provided the proposed response to members of the
Board of Directors.
Later in the day on December 29, 2022, representatives from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton conveyed Univar Solutions’
response to the December 28 Brenntag Proposal telephonically to Brenntag’s legal and financial advisors. That evening, representatives from Goldman
Sachs and Deutsche Bank conveyed Univar Solutions’ response to the Sponsor A December Proposal offer telephonically to representatives of Sponsor
A.
On December 30, 2022, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank conveyed Univar Solutions’ response to the Apollo December
Proposal offer telephonically to representatives of Apollo. Also on December 30, 2022, Univar Solutions provided Apollo and Sponsor A access to due
diligence materials in the Data Room. Over the following weeks Univar Solutions provided access to the Data Room to representatives of Apollo and
Sponsor A, and, once Univar Solutions consented to Platinum Falcon serving as a co-investor on February 1, 2023, to representatives of Platinum Falcon.
Over the next several days, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank scheduled meetings between Univar Solutions’ management and
Apollo and Sponsor A.
On January 1, 2023, Univar Solutions provided Brenntag limited access to the Data Room.
On January 2, 2023, Brenntag released a statement that it had terminated preliminary discussions with Univar Solutions. In addition, Brenntag’s
chief executive officer contacted Mr. Pappas and indicated that each of Brenntag’s management board and supervisory board no longer supported the
possible transaction. That evening, Univar Solutions released a statement confirming that discussions with Brenntag had ceased, but that its Board of
Directors was committed to acting in the best interest of its stockholders and would continue discussions relating to other indications of interest it had
received.
Also on January 2, 2023, Sponsor A reached out to representatives of Goldman Sachs to request permission to commence discussions with
underwriters in connection with a potential debt financing, which outreach Univar Solutions approved. Sponsor A also reached out to representatives of
Goldman Sachs to request that Univar Solutions execute a conflicts waiver to permit one of its selected representatives to perform tax diligence on
Sponsor A’s behalf, which waiver Univar Solutions executed.
On January 3, 2023, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar
Solutions’ management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Pappas and the representatives from Goldman
Sachs and Deutsche Bank facilitated a discussion by the Board of Directors about the status of discussions with potential acquirors, including Apollo
and Sponsor A, as well as with other parties that had previously been engaged in the sale process, and the scheduled meetings with members of Univar
Solutions’ management and Apollo and Sponsor A the week of January 9. Mr. Jukes and the representatives from Wachtell Lipton guided the Board of
Directors in a discussion regarding Brenntag’s withdrawal from the Univar Solutions process, during which the Board of Directors discussed how the
withdrawal did not appear to be based upon documents in the Data Room or any action or position that Univar Solutions had taken (with respect to
Brenntag’s proposal or otherwise).
Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors further discussed Apollo and Sponsor A’s proposals and potential responses with
the representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, including in the context of Univar Solutions’ stand-alone plan, as well as the feasibility and
attractiveness of separating Univar Solutions into certain lines of business. In addition, the Board of Directors discussed (i) the status of equity and debt
financing with respect to Apollo and Sponsor A, (ii) how the withdrawal of Brenntag could permit Univar Solutions to extend the process timeline to
allow Apollo, Sponsor A and other potential acquirors
 
-40-
Table of Contents
time to secure funding or enter into co-bidding arrangements, (iii) the valuation of Univar Solutions that could be achieved upon the successful execution
of Univar Solutions’ stand-alone business plan relative to the consideration proposed in each of the proposals, as well as the ability of Univar Solutions
to undertake other strategic transactions, including separating into differing lines of business, to increase its value to Univar Solutions’ stockholders, and
(iv) the provision of due diligence to Apollo and Sponsor A and matters to be discussed at upcoming management meetings. The Board of Directors then
directed Univar Solutions’ management and advisors to prepare an updated process timeline and directed Univar Solutions’ management, Goldman Sachs
and Deutsche Bank to conduct additional analysis on the feasibility of dividing the Company into separate lines of business.
On the evening of January 9, 2023, members of the Univar Solutions management team met with representatives of Apollo in person in Chicago and
discussed, among other things, Apollo’s views regarding the potential transaction, Apollo’s ability to finance the transaction and potential diligence and
process steps.
On January 10, 2023, members of the Univar Solutions management team continued their meetings with representatives of Apollo. At this meeting,
management of Univar Solutions provided representatives of Apollo with additional information regarding Univar Solutions’ business, potential areas of
value and Univar Solutions’ management’s view of Univar Solutions’ future prospects as a stand-alone, publicly traded company. Apollo also indicated it
had engaged a full team of advisors to engage in detailed diligence, was in discussion with potential debt financing sources and maintained its ability to
fund 100% of the equity requirements for its proposed transaction. Additionally, Univar Solutions’ management and representatives of Apollo and,
following Univar Solutions’ consent to permit Platinum Falcon to serve as a co-investor on February 1, 2023, representatives of Platinum Falcon
participated in multiple business diligence meetings by videoconference in the following weeks. Additionally, during this time, Univar Solutions made
available additional confidential business diligence information to Apollo and its representatives, as well as Platinum Falcon.
On January 11, 2023, members of the Univar Solutions management team met in person with representatives of Sponsor A in Chicago. At this
meeting, management of Univar Solutions provided representatives of Sponsor A with additional information regarding Univar Solutions’ business,
potential areas of value and Univar Solutions’ management’s view of Univar Solutions’ future prospects as a stand-alone, publicly traded company.
Representatives of Sponsor A noted that Sponsor A had a meeting with its investment committee on January 17, 2023, and that they expected to be able
to offer additional details on their ability to engage in due diligence and provide equity and debt financing following such meeting.
Also on January 11, 2023, Bloomberg News published an article online indicating that Univar Solutions was attracting takeover interest from several
potential acquirors. The article named Apollo as a potential bidder.
On January 13, 2023, Mr. Jukes and Mr. Alexos met virtually with representatives of Apollo and certain of Apollo’s potential financing sources. At
this meeting, management of Univar Solutions provided additional information regarding Univar Solutions’ business and Univar Solutions’ management’s
view of Univar Solutions’ future prospects as a stand-alone, publicly traded company.
Commencing on January 16, 2023, Apollo and its representatives began conducting diligence meetings on a number of additional matters.
Thereafter, from January 16, 2023, through March 13, 2023, Apollo, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted confirmatory due diligence on Univar
Solutions, including through the additional materials made available in the Data Room and telephone and videoconference calls with members of Univar
Solutions’ management and with Univar Solutions’ employees. Also, during that period representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Wilmer Cutler Pickering
Hale and Dorr LLP (which we refer to as “Wilmer Hale”), regulatory counsel to Univar Solutions, participated in telephone and videoconference calls with
Apollo, Paul Weiss and their respective regulatory counsel with respect to regulatory due diligence.
Also on January 17, 2023, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank spoke telephonically with Sponsor A to discuss Sponsor A’s
management sessions on January 11, 2023, and Sponsor A’s interest in
 
-41-
Table of Contents
continuing to explore a transaction. Sponsor A reiterated its interest in pursuing a transaction with Univar Solutions, but noted that it needed several
weeks to raise equity co-investments and to conduct due diligence. In addition, Sponsor A requested that Univar Solutions agree to reimburse Sponsor A
for third-party diligence costs it expected it would incur in evaluating a transaction to address the risk that other financial sponsors involved in Univar
Solutions’ process (such as Apollo) would be able to execute on a transaction more quickly. Sponsor A’s request was promptly shared with the Board of
Directors.
On January 19, 2023, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of Univar Solutions’
management, representatives of Univar Solutions’ financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, and representatives of Univar Solutions’ legal
counsel, Wachtell Lipton participated. Mr. Jukes reviewed the Company’s performance for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and how performance
compared to the Company’s guidance. The representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank led the Board of Directors in a discussion of the
status of debt markets, including how the debt markets could impact the ability of private equity sponsors to acquire Univar Solutions. The
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank reviewed the Apollo December Proposal and the management meetings and diligence meetings
conducted with Apollo and the status of negotiations with Apollo, including Apollo’s acknowledgment that it would need to provide an offer without a
financing contingency, Apollo’s continued ability to finance the equity portion of the purchase price, and Apollo’s continued diligence efforts. The
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank then reviewed the Sponsor A December Proposal and the management meetings and diligence
meetings conducted with Sponsor A, the status of negotiations with Sponsor A, including that Sponsor A was not able to proceed as quickly as Apollo
due to its need for substantial equity co-investment and that Sponsor A was requesting expense reimbursement for certain third-party expenses incurred
in connection with evaluating and negotiating a transaction.
The representatives from Wachtell Lipton provided a summary of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and discussed considerations with
respect to providing expense reimbursement to Sponsor A. Following a discussion of the proposed response to Sponsor A’s request for reimbursement,
including on market dynamics applicable to debt financing and the status of potential acquirors’ bids, the Board of Directors determined that reimbursing
Sponsor A for out-of-pocket third-party expenses, subject to a capped amount, was in the best interests of Univar Solutions and its stockholders, and

indication of interest to acquire 100% of the fully diluted shares outstanding of Univar Solutions for $35.00 to $37.00 per share of Univar Solutions
common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “Sponsor A March Proposal”). The Sponsor A March Proposal noted, among other things, that Sponsor
A’s proposal was subject to the completion of further due diligence, but that Sponsor A believed that it could complete streamlined diligence and
negotiate transaction documents in approximately four weeks and provided an illustrative timeline contemplating a signing in late April. The Sponsor A

within a matter of weeks and that the proposed transaction and the resources required to

which were subject to the completion of confirmatory due diligence, the negotiation of definitive transaction documentation and certain other conditions.
The Apollo March 6 Proposal noted that Apollo and Platinum Falcon had completed substantially all due diligence and had received requisite approvals

fund 100% of the equity requirements for Apollo’s proposed transaction, (ii) Apollo and Platinum Falcon were willing to agree to a “hell or high water”
standard on regulatory efforts and (iii) Apollo and Platinum Falcon were in a position to negotiate definitive documentation with Univar Solutions and

On March 7, 2023, Univar Solutions held a regular meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar Solutions’
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Pappas facilitated a discussion by the Board of Directors
about the status of discussions with potential acquirors, including Apollo and Platinum Falcon and Sponsor A, as well as with other parties who had
previously been engaged in the sale process. A representative of Wachtell Lipton then provided an overview of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties
under Delaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Univar Solutions. The representatives from Wachtell Lipton then guided
the Board of Directors in a discussion and review of the draft merger agreement and related transaction documents, including the equity commitment
letter, limited guarantee, and provisions thereof, including the non-solicitation provision, regulatory efforts covenant, conditions to closing, termination
provisions and termination fee. The representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank then reviewed with the Board of Directors preliminary
financial information relating to Univar Solutions, including in scenarios where the Company continued to operate on a stand-alone basis as a public
company or separated certain of its lines of business, based on the Univar Standalone Projections, as defined and described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “—Certain Financial Projections”. Prior to the meeting, each of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank had provided disclosure
regarding their relationships with Univar Solutions, Apollo and Sponsor A, which was provided to the Board of Directors and management of Univar
Solutions.
Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors further discussed the Apollo March 6 Proposal and Sponsor A March Proposal and
potential responses with the representatives from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton, including in the context of Univar Solutions’
stand-alone plan, as well as the feasibility and attractiveness of separating Univar Solutions into certain lines of business. In addition, the

equity and debt documents provided by Apollo and Platinum Falcon, (ii) the valuation of Univar Solutions that could be achieved upon the successful
execution of Univar Solutions’ stand-alone business plan relative to the consideration proposed in each of the proposals, as well as the ability of Univar

stockholders, (iii) the expected timeline to get to a signing with Apollo and Platinum Falcon compared to Sponsor A, the remaining diligence to be done

provided by Apollo and Platinum Falcon, including the non-solicitation provision and termination fees contemplated thereby, and (v) the fact that the
$35.00 price proposed by Apollo and Platinum Falcon was below the range in the Apollo December Proposal, and the proposed response to Apollo and
Platinum Falcon to seek an increased price per share and ensure Apollo and Platinum Falcon put forth an improved bid on an accelerated timeline. The
Board of Directors then directed Univar Solutions’ management and advisors to prepare a response to Apollo and Platinum Falcon that the Board of
Directors was unwilling to approve a transaction at the $35.00 price proposed and requested Apollo and Platinum Falcon provide a revised “best and
final” offer as discussed at the meeting.
Following the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank conveyed Univar Solutions’ response to
the Apollo March 6 Proposal telephonically to representatives of Apollo, including the need to provide a “best and final” proposal and then be prepared

Merger Sub, Apollo and Platinum Falcon to consummate the transaction.
On March 12, 2023, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar

and the Sponsor A March Proposal. In particular, the Board of Directors discussed including the expected timeline to get to a signing with Apollo and
Platinum Falcon compared to Sponsor A, the remaining diligence to be done by Sponsor A and whether Sponsor A would be expected to stay within the

representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank individually presented their respective financial analysis with respect to the Merger
Consideration of $36.15 per share reflected in the Final Apollo Proposal, based on the Univar Standalone Projections. The representatives from Wachtell
Lipton then guided the Board of Directors in a discussion and review of the draft merger agreement and related transaction documents (which had been
provided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting), including the equity commitment letter, limited guarantee and debt commitment letters, including
the interim operating covenants, financing covenants, non-solicitation provision, regulatory efforts covenant, conditions to closing, termination
provisions and termination fee, and discussed how certain financing and regulatory provisions and the closing conditions affected the likelihood of
closing of a potential transaction. A representative of Wachtell Lipton then provided an overview of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under
Delaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Univar Solutions. Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors
then reviewed updated disclosures from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank regarding certain relationships with Apollo, Sponsor A, Platinum Falcon and
their respective affiliates (which had been provided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting), and Goldman Sachs’ and Deutsche Bank’s certain
holdings and loan exposure in Univar Solutions, Apollo, Sponsor A, Platinum Falcon and their affiliates. Following this discussion, members of Univar
Solutions’ management discussed with the Board of Directors the proposed communications strategy in connection with the announcement of the
proposed transaction. Following this discussion, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each rendered its respective oral opinion, each of which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 13, 2023, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, based upon and subject to

Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and reaching its decision to approve the execution, delivery and
performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, determine that it is in best interests of Univar
Solutions and its stockholders and declare it advisable to enter into the Merger Agreement, and recommend that Univar Solutions stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors consulted with Univar Solutions’ senior management team, as well as Univar Solutions’ financial and legal
advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors that the Board of Directors viewed as supporting its decision:
 
•
the current and historical trading prices of shares of Univar Solutions common stock, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $36.15
per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 20.6% to Univar Solutions’ closing stock price on November 22, 2022, the last
trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach, and a premium of 33.6% to the 30-day volume-
weighted average share price of Univar Solutions for the 30 trading days ending on November 22, 2022;
 
•
the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including risks related to fluctuations in industrial production
and consumption and the timing and extent of economic
 
-48-Table of Contents
downturns, increased competitive pressures, including as a result of competitor consolidation, changes in the business strategies of
producers or in the operations of customers, changes in the pricing, demand and availability of chemicals, including Univar Solutions’
costs, margins and gross profit;
 
•
the risk that Univar Solutions is not able to achieve projected financial performance, including the performance contemplated by the
Company Plans, based on, among other things, the Board of Directors’ assessment of Univar Solutions’ business, assets and prospects and
competitive position, the views of the Board of Directors’ financial advisors and the fact that longer-term forecasts called for overall
financial performance of the standalone business above observed historical growth rates of the business and reflected a number of
uncertain assumptions;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing Univar Solutions’ stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity
immediately upon the closing of the Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent
value from Univar Solutions’ standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives involving transactions in which all or a portion of
the consideration would be payable in equity or involving sales of one or more of our lines of business;
 
•
the Board of Directors’ knowledge of the business, assets, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of Univar Solutions, as
well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which Univar Solutions and each of its businesses operate, including
economic, market and capital raising conditions;
 
•
the Board of Directors’ belief that the Merger is more favorable to Univar Solutions stockholders than the other strategic alternatives
available to Univar Solutions, including remaining as an independent public company, the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant
risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing such alternatives;
 
•
the risks and difficulties associated with achieving comparable valuations to other companies operating in the distribution of speciality
chemicals and ingredients;
 
•
the risks and difficulties associated with the lack of other U.S.-based publicly traded companies with a similar mix of products as Univar
Solutions and the size and scale of Univar Solutions’ operations;
 
•
the risks related to succession planning for senior management, particularly Univar Solutions’ chief executive officer, as well as the risks
associated with identifying or retaining potential successors for senior management, including the risk of turnover among employees in
connection with any management changes and continued business instability and uncertainty during any search processes;
 
•
the Board of Directors’ thorough review of strategic alternatives, including the risks associated with, and the feasibility and attractiveness
of, separating Univar Solutions into different lines of business;
 
•
the competitive nature of the sale process conducted by Univar Solutions, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, in
soliciting and evaluating multiple acquisition proposals for Univar Solutions, and the number and terms of, and pricing set forth in, the
acquisition proposals received by Univar Solutions, and the Board of Directors’ determination that Parent’s proposal represented the best
value and likelihood of closing reasonably available to Univar Solutions’ stockholders (as discussed in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “—Background of the Merger”);
 
•
the risks involved in soliciting or negotiating alternative acquisition proposals prior to the execution of a definitive agreement with Parent,
including the risks involved in deferring the execution of the Merger Agreement to continue discussions with Sponsor A, which indicated it
needed several more weeks to be in a position to execute definitive documentation and was still conducting due diligence and needed to
engage with its limited partners for equity capital (as discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Background of the
Merger”) and that Sponsor A had offered a valuation range of $35.00 to $37.00 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash on
March 3, 2023, the midpoint of which was below the Merger Consideration, and the Board of Directors’ belief, based on

interactions of representatives of Univar Solutions with representatives of Parent, that seeking to negotiate with Sponsor A or engaging
with other potential acquirors could jeopardize the availability of Parent’s proposal;
 
•
the risks associated with continuing the sale process to pursue negotiations with Sponsor A or other potential acquirors, including the risks
associated with the distractions posed by the sale process on senior management and employees, the resulting risk of employee turnover,
the risk of creating instability or uncertainty with key business partner relationships and potential stock price volatility;
 
•
the limited number of potential strategic partners likely to be interested and able to execute on a strategic transaction with Univar Solutions,
particularly given the withdrawal of Brenntag from the process and the limited outreach by potential strategic partners following Univar
Solutions’ public announcement on November 25, 2022 of its evaluation of a proposal from Brenntag and announcement on January 2, 2023
that it had ceased discussions with Brenntag but was evaluating other indications of interest, and the Board of Directors’ assessment of the
ability of potential strategic acquirors to acquire Univar Solutions;
 
•
the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire Univar Solutions in light of its size and line of business, as
well as the ability to obtain committed acquisition financing in the current economic climate and interest rate environment;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations, that the Equity Investors and Guarantors were prepared
to enter into a fully negotiated equity commitment letter and limited guarantee and, based on positions taken by Parent during negotiations
and the premium relative to the stand-alone price of Univar Solutions common stock, that the Merger Consideration was the maximum
consideration that Parent was willing to pay;
 
•
the fact that the Merger is not subject to a financing condition and that Parent has obtained committed debt financing from reputable
financial institutions and committed equity financing from the Equity Investors in an aggregate amount sufficient to fund the Merger
Amounts under the Merger Agreement;

the consolidated financial strength and industry expertise of the sponsors, including the successful track record that Apollo and Platinum

and to commit to any go-forward restrictions or obligations on Univar Solutions after closing, in each case as necessary to obtain the
requisite regulatory approvals and to permit Closing by the End Date (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”);

likely to preclude or deter any other party from making a competing acquisition proposal;
 
•
the high probability that the Merger would be completed based on, among other things, Apollo’s and Platinum Falcon’s proven ability to
complete large acquisition transactions, the absence of a financing condition, and the $379.2 million Parent Termination Fee (representing
approximately 6.5% of Univar Solutions’ implied equity value) or the approximately $291.7 million Parent Regulatory Termination Fee

•
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which were reviewed by the Board of Directors with financial and legal advisors, and
the fact that such terms were the product of robust arm’s-length negotiations between the parties;
 
•
Univar Solutions’ ability, under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of Parent’s and
Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other breaches of the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to holders of shares of Univar Solutions common stock who do not vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible
stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or
the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement; and
 
•
the fact that the Merger would be subject to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Univar Solutions stockholders, and Univar Solutions
stockholders would be free to reject the proposed transactions by voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement for any reason,
including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the Special Meeting (which would, in certain cases, be subject to payment by Univar
Solutions in certain circumstances of an approximately $204.2 million Company Termination Fee if Univar Solutions subsequently were to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, an acquisition proposal).
The Board of Directors also considered a variety of risk and other potential negative factors in its consideration of the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, including the following material potentially negative factors:
 
•
the fact that, following the Merger, Univar Solutions will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders
will not participate in any future earnings or growth, and the possibility that, although the Merger provides Univar Solutions’ stockholders
the opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which Univar Solutions’ common stock traded prior to the public announcement of the
Merger, the price of Univar Solutions’ common stock might have increased in the future to a price greater than the Merger Consideration;
 
•
the fact that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner, or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions to the closing of the
Merger;
 
•
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict Univar Solutions’ ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding alternative takeover proposals with third parties, subject to specified exceptions, and that require Univar Solutions to negotiate
with Parent (if Parent desires to propose revisions to the Merger Agreement and negotiate) prior to Univar Solutions being able to terminate
the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal;
 
•
the possibility that Univar Solutions’ obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee of approximately $204.2 million to Parent upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirors from making an alternative
proposal to acquire Univar Solutions;
 
•
the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the
Merger Agreement is adopted by Univar Solutions stockholders, as well as the risks that the required regulatory approvals will not be
obtained or that the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be obtained, resulting in Parent, Merger Sub and the Equity
Investors not having sufficient funds to complete the Merger, or that Parent, Merger Sub and the Equity Investors may otherwise not
obtain sufficient funds to complete the Merger;
 
-52-
Table of Contents
•
the fact that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the Limited Guarantee, provided by the
Guarantors, guarantees Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement only with respect to payment of the $379.2
million Parent Termination Fee, the approximately $291.7 million Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, certain other damages, certain
associated enforcement costs and certain other indemnification and reimbursement obligations;
 
•
the restrictions on the conduct of the business prior to the completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent Univar Solutions from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger;
 
•
the fact that an all-cash merger would be taxable to the stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the substantial time
and effort of management required to consummate the Merger and related disruptions to the operation of Univar Solutions’ business;
 
•
the fact that Univar Solutions’ remedies in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated may be limited to the $379.2 million Parent
Termination Fee or the approximately $291.7 million Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, payable by Parent under certain circumstances,
certain other damages, and certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to
compensate Univar Solutions for any damage caused, and that such termination fees may not be available in all instances where the Merger
is not consummated and, even if available, rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such
action may be uncertain;
 
•
the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the failure to complete the
Merger, and/or actions that Univar Solutions may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the Merger Agreement could have
an adverse impact on existing and prospective business relationships with customers and other third parties and on our employees,
including the risk that certain key members of Univar Solutions’ management might choose not to remain employed with Univar Solutions
prior to the completion of the Merger, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed;
 
•
the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated therein; and
 
•
the fact that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, our
stockholders generally (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Interests of Univar Solutions’ Executive Officers and Directors
in the Merger”).
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material
factors considered by the Board of Directors. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Univar Solutions and its
stockholders, and recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, the Board of Directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign
any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to
different factors. The Board of Directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered, but determined,
in its business judgment, that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of
approving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking
statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
At the March 12, 2023 meeting of the Board of Directors, Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to the Company, rendered its oral opinion to the Board
of Directors, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 13, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock to be
paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to such holders of Univar Solutions common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 13, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services
and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Merger. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Univar Solutions common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
 
•
the Merger Agreement;
 
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2022;
 
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
 
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
 
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
 
•
the Univar Standalone Projections, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the Company.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Univar Solutions
common stock; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the chemical distribution industry and in other industries; and
performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering the opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of
all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company’s consent that the Univar Standalone
Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company.
Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman
Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger
will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which
would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the transaction or the relative merits of
the transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available

to the Company, including a non-binding indication of interest for a transaction proposed by a third party that may have resulted in a higher price per
share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash than in the Merger, which indication of interest the Company advised Goldman Sachs that the Company
determined not to pursue; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $36.15 in
cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not
express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or
any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor
as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or
class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. In addition, Goldman
Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Univar Solutions common stock will trade at any time or as to the potential effects
of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability
of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other condition as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date
of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis 
Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for Univar Solutions common stock for the period beginning on June 17, 2015
and ending March 10, 2023. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to
the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock on November 1, 2022, the date of the Company’s
after-market close announcement of third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings, (ii) the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock on
November 22, 2022, the date when trading volumes of Univar Solutions common stock significantly increased ahead of public announcement of talks
between the Company and Brenntag on November 25, 2022, (iii) the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as “VWAP”) per share of Univar
Solutions common stock for the preceding 30-trading day period ending November 22, 2022, (iv) the highest intra-day price per share of Univar Solutions
common stock over the 52-week period ended on November 22, 2022, (v) the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10,
2023, and (vi) the median equity research analyst price target per share of Univar Solutions common stock as of March 10, 2023 (as described in greater
detail below).
 
-55-
Table of Contents
This analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:
 
•
a premium of 39% based on the closing price of $25.99 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on November 1, 2022;
 
•
a premium of 21% based on the closing price of $29.97 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on November 22, 2022;
 
•
a premium of 34% based on the volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock for the 30-trading day
period ended November 22, 2022;
 
•
a premium of 6% based on the highest intra-day price of $34.00 per share of Univar Solutions common stock over the 52-week period ended
on November 22, 2022;
 
•
a premium of 13% based on the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023; and
 
•
a discount of 6% based on the median analyst price target of $38.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as of March 10, 2023.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 
Using the Univar Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company to derive a
range of illustrative present values per share of Univar Solutions common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount
rates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5%, reflecting estimates of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as
of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 as reflected in the Univar
Standalone Projections (including estimates of the Company’s tax-effected pension balance as net debt rather than treating pension costs as an annual
cash expense) and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company, which were calculated by applying terminal year exit enterprise value (which
we refer to as “EV”) to last twelve months (which we refer to as “LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA multiples ranging from 7.0x to 10.0x, to a terminal year estimate
of the Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by the Company, as reflected in the Univar Standalone Projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth
rates ranging from 0.4% to 5.4%). The range of terminal year exit EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of the Company. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by
application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (which we refer to as “CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the Company’s
target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and
a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the amount of the Company’s net debt, $2,336 million
(inclusive of pension liabilities), as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted
outstanding shares of the Company, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, using the treasury stock
method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Univar Solutions common stock ranging from $33.56 to $55.85. Goldman Sachs
compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar Solutions common
stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as of November 22, 2022, and
the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis 
Using the Univar Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future
value per share of Univar Solutions common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value for the Company as of
December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative next twelve month (“NTM”) enterprise value to
EBITDA (“NTM EV / EBITDA”) of 7.0x to 9.0x to estimates of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2024 to
2026 reflected in the Univar Standalone Projections. This illustrative range of NTM EV / EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs
utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical NTM EV / EBITDA multiples for the Company.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of the Company’s net debt for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025, each as provided by and approved
for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity
values as of December 31 for the Company for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the
projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock for each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025, calculated using
information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of implied future values per share
of Univar Solutions common stock. Goldman Sachs then added the cumulative dividends per share of Univar Solutions common stock expected to be
paid to holders of Univar Solutions common stock through the end of each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025, using estimates provided by Company
management. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future equity values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to December 31, 2022,
using an illustrative discount rate of 11.5%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by
application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $30.36 to $48.90 per share of Univar Solutions
common stock. Goldman Sachs compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share
of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock
as of November 22, 2022, and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Selected Transactions Analysis 
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions (which we refer to as the “Goldman Sachs Selected
Transactions”) in the chemical distribution industry and in other industries since 2010. For each of the Goldman Sachs Selected Transactions, Goldman
Sachs calculated and compared the implied transaction value (which we refer to as “TV”) of the applicable transaction based on the consideration paid in
the transaction for the applicable target company as a multiple of the target company’s LTM adjusted EBITDA based on information in public filings,
press releases and investor relations documents. While none of the businesses that participated in the Goldman Sachs Selected Transactions are directly
comparable to the Company, the businesses that participated in the Goldman Sachs Selected Transactions are businesses with operations that, for the
purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company’s results, market sizes and product profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference
range of TV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 8.3x to 10.6x to the Company’s (i) normalized 2022 actual Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2022
(applying certain normalizing adjustments in respect of foreign exchange losses, non-repeating price benefits and other operating and non-operating
costs at the direction of the Company’s management) and (ii) 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2023, each as provided by and
approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Goldman Sachs
then subtracted the net debt of the Company as of (i) December 31, 2022 and (ii) December 31, 2022 excluding cash in connection with the Company’s two
acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 respectively, each as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of
the Company, and divided each respective result by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock as of December 31,
2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, calculated using information provided by and approved
for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive reference ranges of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
The following table presents the results of this analysis:
 
Reference Ranges of Implied Values Per Share of Univar Solutions Common Stock
Normalized 2022A Adj. EBITDA
2023E Adj. EBITDA
$33.77 - $46.57
$34.75 - $48.09
Goldman Sachs compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of
Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as
of November 22, 2022, and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Premia Paid Analysis 
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions announced
from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2022 involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed transaction
values were between $5 billion
 
-58-
Table of Contents
and $10 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile
premiums of the price paid in the 65 transactions relative to the target’s VWAP for the 30-trading day period prior to announcement of the transaction.
This analysis indicated a median premium of 29% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 21% and 75th percentile
premium of 49% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 21% to 49% to the volume-
weighted average price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 for the 30-trading day period ended November 22, 2022 and calculated a
range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $32.75 to $40.24.
Goldman Sachs compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of
Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as
of November 22, 2022, and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could, Goldman Sachs believes, create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of
all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as
to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in
the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company, Parent, or the contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board of Directors that the $36.15 in cash per
share of Univar Solutions common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Univar Solutions common stock. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future
results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their

The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations by the Company and was approved by the Board of Directors.

consideration to the Company or the Board of Directors or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate Merger
Consideration for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors
in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses

Bank’s opinion was limited to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Univar Solutions common stock
(excluding Parent and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion. The opinion did not address any other terms of the Merger or the Merger Agreement.
Nor did the opinion address the terms of any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection with the Merger. The Company did not
ask Deutsche Bank to, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not, address the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration received in connection therewith,
to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor did it address the fairness of the contemplated
benefits of the Merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger or the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor did Deutsche Bank express an opinion, and
Deutsche Bank’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares of Univar Solutions common stock should vote or act

nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or any class of such
persons, in connection with the Merger whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not address the prices

Univar Standalone Projections, including, at the Board of Directors’ direction, certain sensitivities to the profitability and volume assumptions used in
developing the Univar Standalone Projections. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers and other representatives and advisors
of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In addition, Deutsche Bank:
 
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Univar Solutions common stock;
 
•
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with, to the extent publicly available, similar information for certain
other companies it considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded;
 
•
reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which it deemed relevant;
 
•

Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information, whether publicly
available or furnished to it, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the rendering
of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, assumed and relied
upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and
did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-
balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency or fair
value of the Company, Parent or their respective subsidiaries (or the impact of the Merger thereon) under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to Deutsche Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed with the
knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors that such forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no
view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was necessarily
based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Deutsche Bank
expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which it becomes
aware after the date of its opinion.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, that in all respects
material to its analysis, the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or
amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank also assumed, with the knowledge and permission
of the Board of Directors, that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the
Merger will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions,
terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting expert and has relied

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Board of Directors at its meeting held on March
12, 2023, and that were used in connection with rendering its opinion described above.
The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Deutsche Bank, nor does
the order in which the analyses are described below represent the relative importance or weight given to the analyses by Deutsche Bank. Some of the
summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the analyses, the tables must
 
-63-
Table of Contents
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s analyses. Considering the
data described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information,
to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 10, 2023, and is not necessarily indicative of current
market conditions.
In preparing its analyses, Deutsche Bank utilized calculations of, among other things (i) EV, calculated as equity value plus net debt, and in the case
of the Company, plus the aggregate expected purchase price in connection with the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first quarter of 2023 in
some instances identified below where implied EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples are presented on a pro forma basis for the Company’s two acquisitions
announced in the first quarter of 2023; (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization calculated as the sum of consolidated net income,
depreciation, amortization, net interest expense and income tax expense (which we refer to as “EBITDA”); (iii) EBITDA excluding from net income the
impact of impairment charges, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consist of employee stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring
charges, litigation settlements, other employee severance costs, other facility closure costs, acquisition and integration related expenses and other
unusual or nonrecurring expenses), and other income or expenses, net (which consist of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and
undesignated derivative instruments, non-operating retirement benefits and other non-operating activity) (which we refer to as “Adjusted EBITDA”); (iv)
Adjusted EBITDA plus and/or minus other unusual or nonrecurring items, including non-repeating pricing benefits and bonuses over 100% target as
estimated by management of the Company (which we refer to as “Normalized Adjusted EBITDA”); (v) Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to include the EBITDA
acquired in connection with the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023; and (vi) delivered gross profit, calculated as
gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) less outbound freight and handling (which we refer to as “DGP”). For additional information regarding the Univar
Standalone Projections underlying these calculations, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Certain Financial Projections.” 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Deutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine a range of implied present values per share of Univar Solutions common
stock. Deutsche Bank applied discount rates ranging from 9.5% to 11.5% to estimates of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of the Company
through 2027 calculated based upon the Univar Standalone Projections, including the impact of the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first
fiscal quarter of 2023, and to a range of estimated terminal values of the Company at the end of such period, respectively, to determine a range of implied
enterprise values for the Company as of December 31, 2022. For purposes of its financial analyses, Deutsche Bank calculated unlevered free cash flow as
(a) Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense, plus the net realizable Adjusted EBITDA acquired in
connection with the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 (including the synergies, and cost to achieve such
synergies, associated therewith), (b) less cash taxes, plus (c) depreciation and amortization, less (d) capital expenditures, plus or less (e) change in net
working capital, less (f) other costs, including pension payments, below-the-line expenses and change in other assets and liabilities. Deutsche Bank
derived the foregoing range of discount rates by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain Company-specific inputs, including
the Company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the Company, as well
as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The terminal value was calculated by applying multiples ranging from 7.0x to
9.5x to Company management estimates of 2027 Adjusted EBITDA reduced by $34 million of projected employee stock-based compensation expenses.
Deutsche Bank then subtracted the Company’s estimated net debt of approximately $2.238 billion, adjusted to include the aggregate expected purchase
price in connection with the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first quarter of 2023, and divided the result by the number of fully diluted
shares of Univar Solutions common stock outstanding using the treasury method. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of Univar
Solutions common stock as
 
-64-
Table of Contents
of December 31, 2022 of approximately $33.25 to $50.00 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.25). Deutsche Bank compared this range of implied values per
share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume
weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before volumes
increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per
share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Sensitivity Analysis. At the direction of the Board of Directors, Deutsche Bank also reviewed the impact of the following sensitivities to the Univar
Standalone Projections on the implied value per share derived pursuant to the discounted cash flow analysis described above:
 
•
DGP per ton sensitivity analysis: Increase DGP per ton by $10 and decrease DGP per ton by $10, $20 and $30 as compared to the average
implied DGP per ton estimate for 2023 through 2027 of $328 as projected by Company management and the historical average of DPG per ton
of $284 for 2019 through 2022.
 
•
Volume growth sensitivity analysis: Increase volume compounded annual growth rate (which we refer to as “CAGR”) by 1% and decrease
volume CAGR by 1%, 2% and 3% as compared to the implied volume CAGR for 2022 and estimated for 2022 through 2027 of 4.8% as
projected by Company management.
The results of this analysis were as follows (rounded to the nearest $0.25):

$27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible
transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Illustrative Discounted Future Share Price Analysis
Deutsche Bank calculated an illustrative implied present value of the future prices of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock based on the
Univar Standalone Projections, including the estimated impact of the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. This
analysis was designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future price of the Company’s equity calculated as a multiple of
forward EBITDA. Deutsche Bank applied one-year forward EBITDA multiples ranging from 7.0x to 9.0x to the Company’s estimated 2025 Adjusted
EBITDA to calculate the Company’s estimated equity value in December 31, 2024 based on the projected net debt position for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2024, and discounted the derived equity value using a cost of equity equal to 12.5% on a present value basis to March 10, 2023, which
resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Univar Solutions common stock of approximately $32.25 to $44.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).
Deutsche Bank compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar
Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 as
of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible
transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.

Although none of the Deutsche Bank Selected Transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, the Deutsche Bank Selected Transactions were
selected by Deutsche Bank because certain aspects of the Deutsche Bank Selected Transactions, for the purposes of this analysis and based on
Deutsche Bank’s professional judgment and experience as investment bankers and its knowledge of transactions of a similar nature, may be considered
similar to the Merger.
With respect to each Deutsche Bank Selected Transaction and based on publicly available information, Deutsche Bank calculated the multiples of
the target’s EV to LTM EBITDA or, in the case of one target, to LTM earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (which we refer to as “EBITA”),
based on the applicable target’s LTM EBITDA or LTM EBITA, in each case as most recently disclosed publicly at the time of the announcement of the
applicable Deutsche Bank Selected Transaction.
Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for the Merger based upon the Company’s December 31, 2022 Normalized Adjusted EBITDA. For
purposes of this analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized an implied EV for the Company of $7.914 billion, based upon the Merger Consideration of $36.15 per
share of Univar Solutions common stock.

Based in part upon the multiples of the Deutsche Bank Selected Transactions described above, and taking into account its professional judgment
and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated ranges of estimated implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock by applying multiples of 8.0x
to 10.5x to the Company’s December 31, 2022 Normalized Adjusted EBITDA as provided by management of the Company, resulting in a range of implied
values of approximately $32.00 to $46.25 per share of Univar Solutions common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25). Deutsche Bank compared this range
of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10,
2023, the 30-day volume weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading
date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible transaction), and the Merger Consideration of
$36.15 per share.
Selected Companies Analysis
Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for the Company with
corresponding financial information and valuation measurements for the following three publicly-traded companies (which we refer to as the “Deutsche
Bank Selected Companies”):
 
•
Brenntag SE
 
•
Azelis Group NV
 
•
IMCD NV
Although none of the above Deutsche Bank Selected Companies is directly comparable to the Company, Deutsche Bank considered each of them
generally relevant for the purposes of this analysis, based on its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers, taking into account
several factors, including, among other things, the Company’s operational capabilities and financial profile compared with those of the Deutsche Bank
Selected Companies, the competitive landscape in which the Company and the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies operate and the Company’s product
offerings and those of the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies. Accordingly, the analysis of publicly traded comparable companies was not simply
mathematical. Rather, it involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of such
companies.
Based on the closing prices of the common stock of each of the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies on March 10, 2023, information contained in
the most recent public filings of the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies and equity research analyst consensus estimates of EBITDA for calendar years
2023 and 2024 for each of the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies, Deutsche Bank calculated the following multiples with respect to each of the Deutsche
Bank Selected Companies:
 
•
EV as a multiple of estimated 2023 EBITDA; and
 
•
EV as a multiple of estimated 2024 EBITDA.

Based in part upon the multiples of the Deutsche Bank Selected Companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment and
experience, Deutsche Bank calculated the following ranges of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock:
 
•
approximately $27.50 to $39.00 per share of Univar Solutions common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) by applying multiples of EV to
EBITDA of 7.0x to 9.0x to the estimate of 2023 Adjusted EBITDA as provided in the Univar Standalone Projections; and
 
•
approximately $28.50 to $41.25 per share of Univar Solutions common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) by applying multiples of EV to
EBITDA of 6.5x to 8.5x to the estimate of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA as provided in the Univar Standalone Projections.
Deutsche Bank compared these ranges of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of
Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of
$27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible
transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Additional Information
Deutsche Bank observed additional information that was not considered part of Deutsche Bank’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but
which was noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following:
Historical Stock Trading. Deutsche Bank reviewed the closing prices of the Univar Solutions common stock on the NYSE for the 52 weeks ended
on March 10, 2023. Deutsche Bank observed that during such period, the closing trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock ranged from
$21.72 to $35.44 per share, as compared, for reference only, to the closing per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $32.09 on March 10, 2023, the
30-day volume weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before
volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in
cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets. Deutsche Bank observed the most recent price targets for Univar Solutions common stock reflected in
publicly available equity research reports prepared and published by eight selected equity research analysts between January 11, 2023 and March 2, 2023.
Deutsche Bank noted that the future price targets for Univar Solutions common stock had a median future price target of $37.00 per share and ranged
from $33.00 to $42.00 per share, which Deutsche Bank discounted back 12 months using a 12.5% cost of equity to calculate a range of discounted recent
equity analyst price targets for Univar Solutions common stock of $29.33 to $37.33 per share.

The public market trading prices published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for Univar Solutions
common stock. Further, these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company and future market
conditions. However, these estimates provided general reference points which enabled Deutsche Bank to compare, for reference only, such estimates with
the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $32.09 on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume weighted average trading price per share of
Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of
Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Premiums Paid Analysis. Deutsche Bank reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for 109 all-cash
transactions announced from March 10, 2018 to March 10, 2023 involving a U.S. public company in all industries for which the disclosed enterprise value
for the transaction was greater than $5 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Deutsche Bank calculated the mean, median,
75th percentile and 25th percentile average premia of the price paid in each of the transactions relative to the unaffected 30-day volume-weighted average
price based on the target’s unaffected price.
The information noted by Deutsche Bank with respect to these transactions is summarized below:
 
All Transactions
Premium
over 30-
day
unaffected
VWAP
75th percentile
47%

Deutsche Bank applied ranges of premiums of 23% to 47% to the 30-day volume weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions
common stock of $27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach
regarding a possible transaction). Deutsche Bank noted this implied a range of share prices for Univar Solutions common stock of approximately $33.12 to
$39.65 per share, as compared, for reference only, to the closing per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $32.09 on March 10, 2023, the 30-day
volume weighted average trading price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 as of November 22, 2022 (the last trading date before
volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag’s approach regarding a possible transaction), and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in
cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.
Miscellaneous
This summary is not a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s opinion or the underlying analyses and factors considered in connection with
Deutsche Bank’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business and financial
judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses described
above must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses
and factors could create a misleading view of the process underlying its opinion. Deutsche Bank further believes that selecting portions of the analyses
or summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the Deutsche
Bank opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Deutsche Bank considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular
weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, it made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction in the analyses described above is identical to the Company or the Merger.

Table of Contents
In conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were
prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the fairness of the Merger
Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Univar Solutions common stock (excluding Parent and its affiliates) as of the date of the
opinion and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently
subject to uncertainty. As described above, in connection with its analyses, Deutsche Bank made, and was provided by the management of the Company
with, numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Deutsche Bank or the Company. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual,
past or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the Company or its respective advisors, Deutsche
Bank does not assume responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.
The terms of the Merger, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and
Parent and were approved by the Board of Directors. Although Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Company during the course of these negotiations,
the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration
to the Company or the Board of Directors, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
Merger. As described above, the opinion of Deutsche Bank and its presentation to the Board of Directors were among a number of factors taken into
consideration by the Board of Directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.",55,77

While Univar Solutions has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, including a set of high level, three-year financial
targets that were based on Univar Solutions’ draft strategic plan on Univar Solutions’ November 2, 2022 earnings call, Univar Solutions has not, as a
matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond the then current annual
period due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty,
unpredictability and subjectivity of underlying assumptions and estimates. In the ordinary course, however, Univar Solutions’ management prepares a
five year long range strategic plan, which is updated annually and reviewed with the Board of Directors, that reflects Univar Solutions’ potential financial
and business outlook for Univar Solutions generally over a five-year period.
In connection with the proposed Merger, Univar Solutions is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective
financial information of Univar Solutions, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, prepared by Univar Solutions’ management, solely
because, as described below, certain financial information was reviewed by the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration and evaluation of
the Merger and given to each of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank for their use and reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by
Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors and Goldman Sachs’ opinion as discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Opinion of
Goldman Sachs” and the financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Board of Directors and Deutsche Bank’s opinion as discussed in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “—Opinion of Deutsche Bank”.
As part of Univar Solutions’ annual business review, Univar Solutions’ management prepared and reviewed with the Board of Directors, at its
October 27, 2022 meeting, Univar Solutions’ draft long range strategic plan for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 (which we refer to as the “Univar LRSP”),
which included a financial forecast that was based on and reflected, among other things, assumptions regarding industry performance, general business,
economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as assumptions
 
-70-Table of Contents
specific to Univar Solutions’ business, including expected sales growth, costs, profitability, and cash generation, all of which are difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond Univar Solutions’ control. The Univar LRSP reviewed with the Board of Directors at its October 27, 2022 meeting was subject
to finalization by Univar Solutions’ management in the ordinary course of Univar Solutions’ business.
At its November 16, 2022 special meeting, the Board of Directors further reviewed and discussed the Univar LRSP and directed Goldman Sachs and
Deutsche Bank to utilize the Univar LRSP for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 once it had been finalized by the management of Univar Solutions (which we
refer to as the “Univar Standalone Projections”) in preparing their financial analysis with respect to Univar Solutions and any potential transaction,
including for any fairness opinions to be rendered. Additionally, the management of Univar Solutions provided a copy of the Univar LRSP to Goldman
Sachs and Deutsche Bank for their use in its preliminary financial analysis of Univar Solutions that was presented to the Board of Directors at the
November 20, 2022 special meeting.
Following the November 16, 2022 special meeting of the Board of Directors, Univar Solutions’ management finalized the long range strategic plan
for fiscal years 2023 through 2027. The Univar LRSP was revised to reflect certain updates to the Univar LRSP with regards to the 2023 Annual Operating
Plan, including the Company’s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 and the associated synergies and costs to achieve synergies.
The Univar Standalone Projections similarly involved assumptions regarding, among other things, industry performance, general business, economic,
regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as assumptions specific to Univar Solutions’ business, including expected
sales growth, costs, profitability, and cash generation, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Univar Solutions’ control. The
Univar Standalone Projections were provided to the Board of Directors, and were provided by representatives of Univar Solutions to representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank on January 12, 2023. A copy of the Univar Standalone Projections was provided to Apollo, Platinum Falcon and their
representatives following execution of a confidentiality agreement with Univar Solutions, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—
Background of the Merger.” 
The Univar LRSP and the Univar Standalone Projections are collectively referred to as the “Company Plans.” The Company Plans were prepared
treating Univar Solutions on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger,
the expenses that may be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction or the consummation thereof, the effect of any business or strategic
decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed or in anticipation of the proposed transaction,
or the effect of any alteration, acceleration, postponement or decision not to take any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have
been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the
Merger.
Univar Solutions and its representatives advised the recipients of the Company Plans that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in many
respects. The inclusion of the Company Plans or of this summary does not constitute an admission or representation by Univar Solutions, Goldman
Sachs, Deutsche Bank or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Goldman
Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Univar Solutions or its management, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance
of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and
should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
Company Plans.
The Company Plans and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Plans were based are subjective in many respects and subject to
multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of Univar Solutions’ industry and based on actual experience and business
developments. The Company Plans, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to
 
-71-
Table of Contents
Company performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which
are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond Univar Solutions’ control. The Company Plans
constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements,” that could cause the Company Plans or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and
for actual results to differ materially from the Company Plans. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company Plans will be realized or that actual
results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected, and the Company Plans cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and
should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Plans cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each
successive year. The Company Plans do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared,
including the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the Company Plans may have
changed since the date the Company Plans were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional
significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Plans will be achieved.
In addition, the Company Plans have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Company Plans were prepared
or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of Univar Solutions, Apollo, Platinum Falcon or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and
each of them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Plans or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances
existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in
error (except, in the case of Univar Solutions, as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing
the Company Plans, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held more than four months after the Company Plans were prepared, as
well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting assumptions/information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted
reliance on the Company Plans set forth below. The Company Plans should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements
and other information contained in Univar Solutions’ public filings with the SEC. Univar Solutions urges all of its stockholders to review its most recent
SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find More
Information” for additional information.
The Company Plans were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (which we
refer to as “E&Y”), Univar Solutions’ independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled, or performed
any procedures with respect to the Company Plans and, accordingly, neither E&Y nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form
of assurance with respect thereto. The E&Y report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Univar Solutions’ historical financial
information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.
The Company Plans contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Univar Solutions believes are helpful in understanding its past financial
performance and future results. Univar Solutions management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for
forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Univar Solutions believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to
help investors understand the operating results and to analyze Univar Solutions’ financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are
limitations
 
-72-
Table of Contents
associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not
reported by all of Univar Solutions’ competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Univar Solutions’ competitors due to
potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of an adjusted financial measure to a
GAAP financial measure do not apply to adjusted financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed
business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of adjusted
financial measures were not relied upon by the Board of Directors or the members of management or financial advisors in connection with their respective
evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Univar Solutions has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Company
Plans to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
Univar Solutions has not made and makes no representation to any Univar Solutions stockholder or to Apollo, the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, Parent, Merger Sub, the Apollo Funds or Platinum Falcon in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company Plans or regarding
Univar Solutions’ ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Company Plans or that the projected results will be achieved.

Interests of Univar Solutions’ Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that Univar Solutions stockholders approve the transaction and vote in favor of the
Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, Univar Solutions stockholders should be aware that the
executive officers and directors of Univar Solutions have certain interests in the Merger and transactions contemplated thereby that are or may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Univar Solutions stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and in making
their recommendation that Univar Solutions stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of
them, including compensation that may become payable in connection with the Merger to named executive officers, which is the subject of a nonbinding,
advisory vote of Univar Solutions stockholders, are quantified in the narrative below. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Proposal 2: The Compensation Proposal.” The dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only
and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.
For purposes of this disclosure, the named executive officers of Univar Solutions are:
 
•
David C. Jukes, President and Chief Executive Officer
 
•
Nicholas W. Alexos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
•
Nicholas Powell, Senior Vice President, President of Europe, Middle East and Africa & Asia Pacific and Ingredients & Specialties
 
•
James B. Holcomb, Senior Vice President, President of North America and Chemicals & Services
 
•
Noelle J. Perkins, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Chief Risk Officer
For purposes of this disclosure, “qualifying termination” means a termination of employment by Univar Solutions without cause or by the
applicable executive officer for good reason (each term as defined in the relevant agreement).
Treatment of Univar Solutions Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, each outstanding Univar Solutions Restricted Share Award, Univar Solutions PRSU Award, Univar Solutions RSU Award,
Univar Solutions DSU Award and Univar Solutions Option will be cashed out based on the Merger Consideration, less any required tax withholding and
deductions and less the applicable
 
-74-
Table of Contents
per share exercise price in the case of a Univar Solutions Option, with the number of Univar Solutions shares covered by each Univar Solutions PRSU
Award equal to: (A) for each such award granted in 2021, the greater of (i) 170% of the target number of shares covered by the award and (ii) the number
of shares covered by the award based on the actual level of performance achieved through the period ending on the last day of the calendar month
immediately preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs, (B) for each such award granted in 2022, the greater of (i) 150% of the target
number of shares covered by the award and (ii) the number of shares covered by the award based on the actual level of performance achieved through
the period ending on the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs and (C) for each
such award granted on or following January 1, 2023, the target number of shares covered by such award. For an estimate of the value of unvested equity
awards that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on April 28, 2023, and each of the named executive officers experiences a qualifying termination
on that date, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Univar Solutions’ Named Executive Officers” below. We estimate that the value of
unvested equity awards held by all executive officers, other than the named executive officers, that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs
on April 28, 2023, and all such executive officers experience qualifying terminations on that date is $6,089,395. We estimate that the aggregate value of
unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Univar Solutions that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on April 28, 2023 is
$1,673,745.
Executive Severance Arrangements
Messrs. Jukes, Powell, Alexos and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins
Univar Solutions is party to severance and change in control agreements with each of Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms.
Perkins. Pursuant to the agreements, if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination during the period beginning three months before
and ending 24 months (18 months for Messrs. Alexos and Powell) following a change in control, the named executive officer will be entitled to:
(1) a lump sum cash payment equal to a multiple (2.5x for Mr. Jukes and 2.0x for Messrs. Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins) of the sum
of the named executive officer’s annual base salary and target bonus for the year in which the named executive officer’s employment terminates or the
year in which the Effective Time occurs, if greater;
(2) Except for Mr. Powell, a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination assuming achievement of target performance (or, for Mr. Alexos, based upon
actual achievement), based on the annual bonus target for the year in which the named executive officer’s employment terminates or the year in which the
Effective Time occurs, if greater; and
(3) Except for Messrs. Powell and Alexos, up to 18 months of COBRA health care continuation coverage in the form of premium reimbursements for
the named executive officer and, if applicable, his or her spouse and dependents.
The foregoing payments are conditional upon Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins executing and not revoking a release of
claims agreement with Univar Solutions. Each of Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Holcomb and Powell and Ms. Perkins are prohibited for a period of 18 months (12
months in the case of Mr. Alexos) following termination of employment from competing with Univar Solutions and soliciting Univar Solutions’ employees,
customers and suppliers. Mr. Powell is also party to a garden leave letter which provides that Mr. Powell is entitled to 12 months’ notice of termination of
employment, or, in the event such notice is not given, payment of his base salary for such period.
Other Executive Officers
Univar Solutions is also party to severance and change in control agreements with three of Univar Solutions’ executive officers who are not named
executive officers. Subject to executing and not revoking a
 
-75-
Table of Contents
release of claims agreement with Univar Solutions, each of the three executive officers is entitled to the same benefits as each of Mr. Holcomb and Ms.
Perkins, except that one of the three executive officers is not entitled to COBRA health care continuation coverage but is entitled to receive a specified
contribution to a severance indemnity fund. Each of the three executive officers is also prohibited for a period of 18 months following termination of
employment from soliciting Univar Solutions’ employees, customers and suppliers, and each is, in a separate agreement, prohibited from competing with
Univar Solutions for the same period following termination.
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments described above that would be payable to Univar Solutions’ named executive officers upon
a qualifying termination on April 28, 2023, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Univar Solutions’ Named Executive Officers” below. We
estimate that the aggregate value of severance payments that would be payable to the three Univar Solutions executive officers who are not named
executive officers, assuming a qualifying termination on April 28, 2023, is $4,622,630.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Univar Solutions’ directors and officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. This indemnification and
insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.” 
New Compensation Arrangements
Any executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to the
Surviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit
plans maintained by Parent, any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation arrangements
between such persons and the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been established or discussed.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Univar Solutions’ Named Executive Officers
The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Univar Solutions’ named executive officers would receive in
connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination
on April 28, 2023 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); (ii) a per share price of Univar
Solutions common stock of $36.15; (iii) that each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in
effect as of the date of this proxy statement; and (iv) the Univar Solutions Restricted Share Award, Univar Solutions PRSU Award, Univar Solutions RSU
Award, Univar Solutions DSU Award and Univar Solutions Option (which together we refer to as the “Univar Solutions Equity Awards”) are outstanding
as of April 28, 2023. The calculations in the table below do not include any amounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were
vested as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the
Effective Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to April 28, 2023. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which
may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts,
if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

Cash Payments for Named Executive Officers.
Each of the named executive officers is party to an agreement that provides for severance in connection with a change in control.
In the event of a qualifying termination, each of Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins is entitled to (1) a lump sum cash
payment equal to a multiple (2.5x for Mr. Jukes and 2.0x for Messrs. Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins) of the sum of the named executive
officer’s annual base salary and target bonus for the year in which the named executive officer’s employment terminates or the year in which the Effective
Time occurs, if greater; (2) except for Mr. Powell, a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination assuming achievement of target performance (or, for Mr.
Alexos, based upon actual achievement which is assumed to be equal to target performance for the purpose of this Golden Parachute Table), based on
the target bonus for the year in which the named executive officer’s employment terminates or the year in which the Effective Time occurs, if greater; and
(3) except for Messrs. Alexos and Powell, up to 18 months of continued COBRA health coverage for the named executive officer, his or her spouse and
his or her dependents, as applicable, in the form of premium reimbursement. Mr. Powell is also party to a garden leave letter which provides that Mr.
Powell is entitled to 12 months’ notice of termination of employment, or, in the event no such notice is given, payment of his base salary for such period
in the amount of $514,352 (which amount is included in the table above).
The foregoing payments are conditional upon each of the named executive officers executing and not revoking a release of claims against Univar
Solutions. Each of the named executive officers is prohibited for a period of 18 months (12 months in the case of Mr. Alexos) following termination of
employment from competing with Univar Solutions and soliciting Univar Solutions’ employees, customers and suppliers.

Equity Award Treatment.
At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Univar Solutions Equity Award will be cashed out based on the Merger Consideration, less any
required tax withholding and deductions and less the applicable per share exercise price in the case of a Univar Solutions Option. For purposes of the
Golden Parachute Compensation table above and the table directly below, the number of shares of Univar Solutions common stock covered by
 
-77-
Table of Contents
each Univar Solutions PRSU Award is equal to: (A) for each such award granted in 2021, 170% of the target number of shares of Univar Solutions
common stock covered by the award, (B) for each such award granted in 2022, 150% of the target number of shares of Univar Solutions common stock
covered by the award, and (C) for each such award granted on or following January 1, 2023, the target number of shares of Univar Solutions common
stock covered by such award. If the number of shares covered by each PRSU Award granted in 2021 and/or each PRSU Award granted in 2022 would be
greater if measured based upon the actual level of performance achieved as of the period ending on the last day of the calendar month immediately
preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs, such measure will instead be utilized and the values of such awards may be greater than
reflected in the below table. All Univar Solutions Stock Options were vested as of immediately prior to the assumed Effective Time and therefore not
included in the Golden Parachute Compensation table or the table below.

As described above under “—Interests of Univar Solutions’ Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger—Executive Severance

each of Messrs. Jukes and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins, and, as applicable, his or her spouse and dependents.
Financing of the Merger
The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of any financing. Parent plans to fund the Merger Consideration with
committed Equity Financing and Debt Financing, as described below.
The Apollo Funds and Platinum Falcon have committed to severally contribute, or cause to be contributed, to Parent the Equity Financing, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, which will be used by Parent, together with the Debt Financing described below,
and available cash of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries (if any), solely to fund each such Equity Investor’s pro rata share of the Obligations.
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, a subsidiary of Parent obtained Debt Commitment Letters for the Debt Financing. The
availability of the Debt Financing is subject to customary conditions precedent.

Appraisal Rights",86,86
Univar Solutions Inc._20230502_DEFM14A_20844849_4658083.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
This section summarizes Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. The following discussion is not a complete
statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may
be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that
you exercise your appraisal rights under Section 262.
Any person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions of Section 262, which may be accessed
without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262), particularly the
procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding and perfecting
appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a (i) “stockholder” are to the record
holder of Univar Solutions common stock, (ii) “beneficial owner” are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock
held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) “person” are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated
association or other entity.
Under Section 262, stockholders and beneficial owners desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1) properly deliver a written demand for an
appraisal of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock to Univar Solutions prior to the stockholder vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
(2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (3) hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of
Univar Solutions common stock upon the making of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, such shares of
Univar Solutions common stock through the Effective Time; (4) not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or otherwise lose their
appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL; and (5) otherwise meet the criteria and follow the procedures set forth in Section 262.
However, assuming the shares of Univar Solutions common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which
we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all
stockholders and beneficial owners of Univar Solutions common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares
of Univar Solutions common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%
 
-79-Table of Contents
of the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the value of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the
Merger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to these conditions as the “Minimum Conditions.”
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment;
provided, however, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may
pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount
that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair
value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less
than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of the stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or information directing
the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement
constitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be accessed without
subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In connection with the
Merger, any person who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such person’s right to do so should review Section 262 carefully.
Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person
who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock must
strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The
Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption
of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding
methods of voting.
Filing Written Demand
Any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger will, in and of itself, constitute a
written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must
 
-80-
Table of Contents
be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s failure to make the
written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting may constitute a waiver of appraisal
rights.
Record Holders
A demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the
identity of the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If a
holder of record is submitting a demand with respect to shares owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one
person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including
an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of
record, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of Univar Solutions common stock as nominee or intermediary for one or
more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of Univar Solutions common stock held for one or more beneficial owners
while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Univar Solutions
common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Univar Solutions common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be
presumed to cover all shares of Univar Solutions common stock held in the name of the holder of record.
Beneficial Owners
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in accordance with the procedures
of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time
and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262, and (ii) the demand made by
such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of
such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to
be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Univar Solutions under Section 262 and to be set forth
on the Verified List. Although not expressly required by Section 262, Univar Solutions reserves the right to take the position that it may require the
submission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 with respect to any person sharing beneficial
ownership of the shares for which such demand is submitted.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to: Secretary, Univar Solutions Inc., 3075 Highland
Parkway, Suite 200, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic transmission.
Actions After Completion of the Merger
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of Univar Solutions common
stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal as of the Effective Time, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date
thereof.
At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s
 
-81-
Table of Contents
demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares and accept the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement
with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to us as the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the fair value of the
shares held by all our stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition,
and no person should assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of
Univar Solutions common stock. Accordingly, any stockholders or beneficial owners who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all
necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed
in Section 262. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock to file such a petition within the period
specified in Section 262 could result in the loss of appraisal rights.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon
written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial
owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such
shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must
give this statement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10
days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of Univar Solutions common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is
served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware
Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded
appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all
of the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by
the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine those persons who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
In addition, assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the
Minimum Conditions is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of Univar Solutions
common stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value
 
-82-
Table of Contents
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value
(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262
of the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as described above).
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court
of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered,
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that,
in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise
and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262
provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,”
but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of
Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock as so determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner
address, “fair value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is
fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering
exercising appraisal rights should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the
Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Neither Univar Solutions nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger
Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock exercising
appraisal rights, and Univar Solutions and Parent each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of
the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Univar Solutions common stock is
less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not
timely filed, neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange
immediately prior to the Effective Time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 to perfect and seek appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an
appraisal will cease.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person
whose name appears on the Verified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation
to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order.
The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
 
-83-
Table of Contents
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of
a person whose name appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 or subject to
such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own
expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Univar Solutions common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or
successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of Univar Solutions common stock will be deemed to have been converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without interest. A person will fail to
perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, neither
of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to
the Effective Time) or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares of Univar
Solutions common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares,
except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if
neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately
prior to the Effective Time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the
demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares within 60 days after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 262, then the
right of such person to an appraisal of such shares will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, no
appraisal proceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the
Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262; provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand in respect of some or all of such
person’s shares and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal within 60 days after the Effective
Time.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel
before attempting to exercise those rights.

In connection with the Merger Agreement, two complaints have been filed as individual actions in federal court. The complaints are captioned
O’Dell v. Univar Solutions Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-03314 (S.D.N.Y., April 20, 2023) and Wang v. Univar Solutions Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-03370 (S.D.N.Y.,

connection with the Merger Agreement.
The Shareholder Actions generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on April 13, 2023 in connection with the
Merger Agreement misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The Shareholder Actions assert violations of Section 14(a) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule

14a-9 promulgated thereunder by the Company and the members of its Board of Directors. The Shareholder Actions seek, among other things: to enjoin
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement unless and until the purportedly material information omitted from the
Preliminary Proxy is disclosed; rescission or rescissory damages in the event the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated;
direction for an accounting to the plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result of the purported wrongdoing; an award of costs and disbursements of the

The following is a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders (as
defined below) of shares of Univar Solutions common stock whose shares of Univar Solutions common stock are converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Univar Solutions common stock as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to, as amended, as the “Code”) (generally, property held for
investment). This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. Holders. This discussion is
based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which
we refer to as the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary
to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has
been or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:
 
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
•
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or
 
•
a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust
validly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to Univar Solutions stockholders subject
to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:
 
•
banks and other financial institutions;
 
•
mutual funds;
 
•
insurance companies;
 
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
 
-85-Table of Contents
•
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of Univar Solutions common stock;
 
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
 
•
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
 
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds;
 
•
holders that hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction
or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
 
•
holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 
•
partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations,” or any other pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);
 
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Univar Solutions common stock (by vote or value);
 
•
holders that received their shares of Univar Solutions common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-qualified retirement plan
or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
 
•
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax;
 
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
•
holders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
 
•
holders subject to any applicable minimum tax;
 
•
holders exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL; and
 
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Univar Solutions common stock as a result of
such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other
non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any
considerations arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or any
considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance
promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or
practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).
If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions
common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of
the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships
holding shares of Univar Solutions common stock, and any partners therein, should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to
them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR UNIVAR
SOLUTIONS STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE UNIVAR SOLUTIONS STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU
SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF
YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES.

Table of Contents
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for Univar Solutions
common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the
Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Univar Solutions common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Univar Solutions common stock. A U.S. Holder’s gain or
loss on the disposition of shares of Univar Solutions common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will
generally be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the
Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Univar Solutions common stock at different
times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Univar
Solutions common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless
the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct
taxpayer identification number and certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and
otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a
credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.
THIS DISCUSSION IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL CHANGES TO OR
INTERPRETATIONS OF CURRENT LAW, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET
FORTH HEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS
THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME
TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES.

General
Each of Parent and the Company has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts to
take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with one another in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances,
approvals, and expirations or terminations or waiting periods from governmental entities as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger Agreement —  Regulatory Efforts and Related Matters.” These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act, CFIUS Approval, and certain
specific other filings and related approvals under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of other jurisdictions as described further below.
 
-87-Table of Contents
U.S. Regulatory Clearances 
The Merger is subject to the HSR Act. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or termination of a 30-
day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or the DOJ issues a Second Request prior to the
expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have
substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.
The parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 27, 2023, and the initial 30-day waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on April 26, 2023.
At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin
the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under
the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
In addition, the Merger is conditioned on CFIUS Approval. The parties submitted a draft notice to CFIUS on March 30, 2023 and a formal notice on
April 24, 2023.
Other Regulatory Clearances
In addition to HSR clearance and CFIUS Approval, the Merger is also subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions
under their applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws. These include antitrust approvals in Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Mexico and
Turkey, as well as foreign investment approvals in France, Italy and Spain. Each of the foregoing filings, or drafts thereof, were submitted to the relevant
government authority on or before April 10, 2023. On April 24, 2023, the parties obtained clearance from the Superintendency of the Administrative
Council for Economic Defense in Brazil.
In each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting
periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make these filings
as promptly as practicable. The relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or
desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to commit to certain undertakings with respect to the operations of the Parent or Company
after the Closing.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock entitled to vote thereon is required
for approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting, (b) abstentions and (c) “broker non-votes” (if
any) will each have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal. Shares of Univar Solutions common stock represented by
properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Univar Solutions
stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Univar Solutions common stock
represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such
shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement,
which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is
important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or
any other information contained in this proxy statement. 
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (a) were made only for
purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (b) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (c) may be
subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Univar Solutions, Parent, and Merger Sub in connection
with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for
the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Univar Solutions, Parent, and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be
subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Univar Solutions stockholders are not

the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the
covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Univar Solutions, Parent, and Merger Sub, because the parties
may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letters to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to
by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as
Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Univar

of Univar Solutions or Merger Sub, each share of Univar Solutions common stock, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but
excluding Cancelled Shares, Owned Company Shares, Dissenting Shares and shares covered by Univar Solutions Restricted Share Awards, will be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $36.15 per share in cash, without interest, subject to any required tax
withholding.
Each Cancelled Share will be cancelled and cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor, and any Owned Company
Share, immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the
ownership percentage of any such person in the Surviving Corporation will equal the ownership percentage of such shares represented immediately prior
to the Effective Time.
If, between March 13, 2023 and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions are changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or similar event, the
Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to proportionally reflect such change.

Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into

provisions of, and as provided by, Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Dissenting Share held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively
have waived, withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Univar Solutions will be closed, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be given a copy of the letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal
in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.
In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person making such a claim
and, if required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) of the number of shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate and (y) the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares
on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of shares who
have not surrendered their shares in accordance with the processes described in this section may look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their shares.

Univar Solutions has further agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers to, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other affiliates and representatives to:
 
•
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent, Merger

confidentiality agreement.
From and after March 13, 2023, Univar Solutions has agreed to (A) promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours after receipt) notify Parent in the
event that Univar Solutions receives any Alternative Proposal, which notice will include, to the extent known or available, the identity of the person or

thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt (and, in any event within 48 hours) basis of any material developments with respect to the status
and terms (including any material change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal) of any such Alternative Proposal.
At any time prior to the obtaining the Univar Solutions Stockholder Approval, if (i) Univar Solutions receives a bona fide written Alternative
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of the “no shop” provisions described earlier in this section and (ii) the Board of Directors determines
in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, Univar Solutions may take the following actions:
 
•
furnish non-public information of Univar Solutions or its subsidiaries and their affiliates to the third party or group making such Alternative
Proposal, as well as its representatives and affiliates and potential financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with Univar Solutions having provisions as to confidential treatment of information
that are not materially less favorable to Univar Solutions than the

Table of Contents
confidentiality provisions of the confidentiality agreement entered into between Univar Solutions and Apollo Management X, L.P. (which
we refer to as the “Confidentiality Agreement”) (provided that any material non-public information has previously been provided to Parent

•
engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party or group (as well as its representatives and affiliates and potential financing
sources) with respect to the Alternative Proposal.
An “Alternative Proposal” is defined as any bona fide written indication of interest, proposal or offer made by any person or group (other than by
Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates) relating to, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (i) merger, reorganization,
spin-off, share exchange (including a split-off), consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving Univar Solutions pursuant to which such person or group (or the stockholders of any person) would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
20% of the assets of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (based on the fair market value thereof) or more than 20% of the
shares, (ii) acquisition or exclusive license of more than 20% of the assets of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (based on the
fair market value thereof), (iii) acquisition of more than 20% of the outstanding shares or more than 20% of the total voting power of equity securities of
Univar Solutions or (iv) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning more than 20% of the
total voting power of equity securities of Univar Solutions (in each case, other than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement).
A “Superior Proposal” is defined as a bona fide, written Alternative Proposal that was not solicited in violation of the Merger Agreement,
substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “20%” in each place it appears, that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and legal counsel, and taking into account all financial (including financing terms), legal, timing, certainty of
consummation, regulatory and other aspects and risks of such Alternative Proposal, would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of Univar Solutions than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any commitments or proposals made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of the Merger and the
Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions described in the section of the proxy statement entitled “The Board of Directors’ Recommendation;

As described in this proxy statement, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that
Univar Solutions stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Recommendation”). Except as set forth in this section and
the section of the proxy statement entitled “—No Solicitation”, the Board of Directors has agreed that it will not take any of the following actions (any
such action, a “Change of Recommendation”):
 
•

therefor in writing from Parent following the initial public disclosure of an Alternative Proposal or any material modification to a publicly
disclosed Alternative Proposal (other than of the type referred to in the fifth bullet of this paragraph) (or, if the Special Meeting is scheduled
to be held within five business days of such request and such request is received at least one business day prior the date of the Special
Meeting, prior to the date of the Special Meeting)

Proposal);
 
•
fail to include the Recommendation in this proxy statement; or
 
•
fail to recommend, in a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or
exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within 10 business days after the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer.
Prior to obtaining the Univar Solutions Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Alternative Proposal received by
Univar Solutions after March 13, 2023 that did not result from a material breach of the provisions described in this section or the section of the proxy
statement entitled “—No Solicitation”, (x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y) cause Univar Solutions to terminate the Merger Agreement
pursuant to the Superior Proposal Termination Right as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Termination of the Merger Agreement”
in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, so long as:
 
•
the Board of Directors has first determined in good faith, (1) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
 
•
(A) Univar Solutions has given Parent at least three business days’ written notice (which we refer to as a “Superior Proposal Notice”)
advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement, which Superior Proposal
Notice includes a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the
Board of Directors, the identity of the person making the Superior Proposal and a copy of any material written proposal and the proposed
definitive agreements (including, if applicable, financing documentation) for such Superior Proposal, if any, and (B) during such three
business day notice period, if requested by Parent, Univar Solutions, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner so that
such Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (C) at the end of such three business day notice period, after taking
into account any commitments or binding proposals made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement during the
period following delivery of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors that the Alternative Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal (provided that any material modifications or amendments to the terms of such Alternative Proposal will commence a new
notice period of two business days).
Prior to obtaining the Univar Solutions Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in this
section below) make a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Board of Directors to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law (it being understood that any such determination in and of itself will not be deemed a Change of Recommendation), so long as:
 
•
Univar Solutions has given Parent at least three business days’ written notice (which we refer to as an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising
Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice includes a description of the applicable
Intervening Event;
 
•
during such three business day period, if requested by Parent, Univar Solutions, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives
engage in good-faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives to
 
-104-
Table of Contents
amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner that would permit the Board of Directors not to make such
Change of Recommendation; and
 
•
at the end of such three business day period, after taking into account any commitments or binding proposals made by Parent in writing to
amend the terms of the Merger Agreement during the period following delivery of such Intervening Event Notice, the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of
Recommendation would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law
(provided that any material changes relating to such Intervening Event will commence a new notice period two business days).
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement will prevent Univar Solutions or its Board of Directors from (i) taking or disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a “stop, look
and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with Univar Solutions’ outside legal counsel, that such disclosure would be required under applicable law, and no such
disclosure or communication will be considered a Change of Recommendation or require the giving of a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event
Notice. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a factually accurate required public statement by Univar Solutions or the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) that describes the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, the identity of the person or group making such Alternative Proposal, the
material terms of such Alternative Proposal and the operation of the Merger Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding,
withdrawal, amendment, qualification, or modification, or proposal by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, the Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Alternative Proposal; or (C) a Change of
Recommendation.
After delivery of any written notice pursuant to the provision described in this section and during the Pre-Closing Period, to the extent Parent
desires to engage in good faith negotiations, Univar Solutions will promptly (and in any event within 36 hours of any material development) keep Parent
informed of all material developments affecting any such Intervening Event or Change of Recommendation.
An “Intervening Event” is defined as any event, change, occurrence or development that is material and that (i) is unknown and not reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or any member thereof) as of March 13, 2023, or if known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or
any member thereof) as March 13, 2023, the consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or any member
thereof) as of March 13, 2023, and (ii) does not involve or relate to any Alternative Proposal. In no event will the following events, changes, occurrences
or developments, in and of themselves, constitute an Intervening Event: (x) the receipt, existence of or terms of any Alternative Proposal or (y) any
change in the price or trading volume of the shares or any other securities of Univar Solutions or its subsidiaries (provided that the underlying causes of
such changes may constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event).",110,112

•
long and short-term incentive opportunities (excluding any retention, change in control or similar compensation, but including equity-based

awards, Parent may provide or cause to be provided, cash-based awards having substantially comparable aggregate value as (but which
may have different vesting terms and performance conditions than) the equity awards in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time);
 
•
other employee benefits (excluding any equity-based, long-term incentive, retention, change in control or similar onetime or special benefits
or arrangements, severance, non-qualified deferred compensation, postretirement health and welfare benefits and defined benefit pension
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective
Time; and
 
•
severance benefits equal to the severance benefits that would have been provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company’s severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Company
Employee’s execution and nonrevocation of a release of claims against Parent and its affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Company Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are subject to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement, Parent will, or will cause its subsidiaries to, instead comply with the terms and conditions of each such applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement, in a manner consistent with applicable law.
For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and determining level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), Parent will (a) credit each Company
Employee with his or her years of service with Univar Solutions, subject to customary inclusions, (b) make eligible each Company Employee, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to generally be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, and (d) use commercially reasonable efforts to generally cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year.

Platinum Falcon to and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Entities to comply with their respective obligations thereunder,
including to fund the Financing.

Nothing contained in this proxy statement or in the Merger Agreement will require Univar Solutions or any of its subsidiaries, prior to the Closing,
to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent has agreed to, promptly upon written request by Univar Solutions, reimburse
Univar Solutions and each of its subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by them or their respective representatives
in connection with such cooperation and to reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries and their respective
representatives from and against any and all liabilities and losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
or the transactions contemplated by the section of this proxy statement entitled “–Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness”, any action taken by them
at the request of Parent or its representatives as described in this section or the section of this proxy statement entitled “–Cooperation as to Certain
Indebtedness” and any information used in connection therewith (other than liabilities or losses resulting solely from information provided by Univar
Solutions or its subsidiaries), in each case, other than to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of the Merger Agreement by, Univar Solutions, its subsidiaries or any of their representatives, as
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties have agreed that the provisions discussed in this section represent the sole obligation of Univar Solutions, its subsidiaries and their
respective representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letters, and no other provision of the
Merger Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules) or the Commitment Letters will to expand or modify such obligations.
Univar Solutions has further agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Financial
Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Financial Information is (i) Compliant (as defined and further described in the
Merger Agreement) and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of “Required Financial Information” in the Merger Agreement.
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, request the cooperation of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries as described in this section
of the proxy statement at any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between March 13, 2023 and the Closing (provided that the
Marketing Period will not be applicable as to each attempt to access the markets (it being understood and agreed that once the Marketing Period has
commenced and then been completed, there will not be a subsequent Marketing Period). Parent has agreed to provide Univar Solutions drafts of all
Offering Documents and all marketing materials for the Debt Financing with a reasonable time to review such documents and materials, and subject to
Parent’s compliance with such obligation, Univar Solutions agrees to use reasonable best efforts to review all such Offering Documents and marketing
materials and identify for Parent any information contained therein that it reasonably believes constitutes material non-public information with respect to
Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or their respective securities. If Univar Solutions identifies any such information, and such
information is customarily included in offering documents or marketing materials for debt financing of the type consistent with the Debt Financing, is
reasonably requested by Parent to be included in the Offering
 
-110-
Table of Contents
Documents or marketing materials for the Debt Financing and does not include information as to which Univar Solutions reasonably objects, then Univar
Solutions has agreed that it will file a Current Report on Form 8-K containing such material non-public information. Parent will remove all such identified
material non-public information that is not acceptable from such Offering Documents and marketing materials.
All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding Univar Solutions or any of its affiliates obtained by Parent or its representatives
pursuant to the provision of the Merger Agreement described in this section will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.
Univar Solutions has consented to the use of its and its subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the Debt Financing (provided that such trademarks and
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Univar Solutions or any of its subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of Univar Solutions or any of its subsidiaries).
The “Marketing Period” is defined as the first period of 18 consecutive days after March 13, 2023 (a) throughout and at the end of which Parent has
the Compliant Required Financial Information and (b) throughout and at the end of which the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to
effect the Merger described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived and nothing
has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of such conditions to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any
time during such 18 consecutive day period; provided that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to August 18, 2023, the Marketing Period will
not commence earlier than September 5, 2023, and May 29, 2023, July 3, 2023, July 4, 2023, November 23, 2023 and November 24, 2023 do not constitute
days for purposes of calculating the Marketing Period (provided further that such exclusion will not restart such period). Further, the Marketing Period
will end on any earlier date prior to the expiration of the 18 consecutive day period described above if the Debt Financing is closed on such earlier date
and the Marketing Period will not be deemed to have commenced if, after March 13, 2023 and prior to the completion of such 18 consecutive day period:
 
•
Univar Solutions has publicly announced its intention to, or determines that it must, restate any historical financial statements or other
financial information included in the Required Financial Information or any such restatement is under active consideration, in which case,
the Marketing Period will not commence or be deemed to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the
applicable Required Financial Information has been amended and updated or Univar Solutions has publicly announced or informed Parent
that it has concluded that no restatement will be required in accordance with GAAP;
 
•
Univar Solutions’ independent auditor has withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any audited financial statements contained in the
Required Financial Information, in which case the Marketing Period will not commence or be deemed to commence unless and until a new
audit opinion is issued with respect to such audited financial statements (or portion thereof) for the applicable periods by the independent
auditor of Univar Solutions or another independent public accounting firm of national standing reasonably acceptable to Parent (any “big
four” accounting firm being acceptable); or
 
•
any Required Financial Information would not be Compliant at any time during such 18 consecutive day period or otherwise ceases to meet
the requirement of “Required Financial Information” as set forth in the Merger Agreement, in which case the Marketing Period will not
commence or be deemed to commence unless and until such Required Financial Information is updated or supplemented so that it is
Compliant and meets the requirement of “Required Financial Information” as set forth in the Merger Agreement (it being understood that if
any Required Financial Information provided at the commencement of the Marketing Period ceases to be Compliant during such 18
consecutive day period, then the Marketing Period will be deemed not to have commenced).
If at any time Univar Solutions in good faith believes that it has provided the Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to
that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which
 
-111-

case, the requirement to deliver the Required Financial Information will be deemed to have been satisfied as of the date of delivery of such notice, unless
Parent in good faith reasonably believes Univar Solutions has not completed the delivery of the Required Financial Information on such date and, within
three business days after the date of delivery of such notice, delivers a written notice to Univar Solutions to that effect (stating with specificity which
Required Financial Information Univar Solutions has not delivered). Following delivery of such Required Financial Information specified in such notice,
the Marketing Period will commence so long as all other conditions and requirements for the Marketing Period to commence are satisfied (provided that
such written notice from Parent to Univar Solutions will not prejudice Univar Solutions’ right to asset that the Required Financial Information was, in fact,
delivered and is Compliant).

Offers for and Redemption of Senior Notes
Univar Solutions has agreed that Parent or Merger Sub will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
dated as of November 22, 2019, among Univar Solutions USA Inc., as issuer, Univar Solutions, as guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (which we refer to as the “Trustee”), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture,
dated as of November 22, 2019, among Univar Solutions USA Inc., as issuer, Univar Solutions, as guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and
the Trustee (which we refer to as the “Indenture”) (pursuant to which Univar Solutions’ 5.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (which we refer to as the “Senior
Notes”) were issued), and applicable law, including SEC rules and regulations, one or more offers to purchase, including any “Change of Control Offer”
(as such term is defined in the Indenture) and/or any tender offer, or any exchange offer, and to conduct one or more consent solicitations, if any (each
such offer or solicitation by Parent or Merger Sub we refer to as a “Debt Offer” and collectively, the “Debt Offers”, and any such consent solicitation we
refer to as a “Consent Solicitation”) in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The closing of
any such Debt Offer will not be consummated prior to the Closing and any such transaction will be funded using consideration provided by Parent or any
of its subsidiaries (other than Univar Solutions or one of its subsidiaries). Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to consult with Univar Solutions regarding
the material terms and conditions of any Debt Offers, including the timing and commencement of any Debt Offers and any tender deadlines. Parent and
Merger Sub are not permitted to commence any Debt Offer until Parent has provided to Univar Solutions the necessary offer to purchase, consent
solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, press release, if any, in connection therewith, and each other document relevant to the transaction that will be
distributed by Parent or Merger Sub to holders of the Senior Notes (collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a reasonable period of time in advance of
commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow Univar Solutions and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents (and Parent will
consider in good faith comments of Univar Solutions and its counsel thereon). Each of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries has agreed to use its
respective reasonable best efforts to, and to use its respective reasonable best efforts to cause its respective affiliates, officers, employees and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Debt Offers. Neither Univar Solutions nor any of its
subsidiaries is required to incur any financing or provide assistance in obtaining any financing for a Debt Offer other than the Debt Financing (and no
such Debt Offer will delay the Closing beyond the date that it is required to occur under the Merger Agreement). The closing of the Debt Offers will be
expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing. The Debt Offers will be conducted in compliance with the Indenture and applicable law
(including SEC rules and regulations) and Univar Solutions will not be required to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the terms of the Indenture or applicable law.
Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents in connection with any Consent Solicitation, Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries have agreed to
execute one or more supplemental indentures to the Indenture in accordance with the Indenture, amending the terms and provisions of the Indenture as
described in the applicable Debt Offer, as reasonably requested by Parent, which supplemental indentures will become effective upon the
 
-112-Table of Contents
execution thereof (or as otherwise contemplated in the applicable Consent Solicitation) and operative no earlier than the Closing Date. In no event will
Univar Solutions or any of its officers, directors or other representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other
agreement that would, in the opinion of Univar Solutions, its counsel or the Trustee, be inconsistent with the terms of the Indenture or applicable law or
that would become operative before the Closing Date.
If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent or Merger Sub commencing any Debt Offers for the Senior Notes, Univar Solutions has
agreed to (i) send a notice of redemption with respect to all or a portion of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (which will be
in the form required under the Indenture and conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing, if sent prior to the Closing, and will be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Univar Solutions) to the Trustee and (ii) request that the Trustee deliver such notice to the holders of the Senior
Notes, and, if such notice is sent prior to the Closing, and solely to the extent required by the terms of the Indenture and by the Trustee in order to cause
or permit the Trustee to so deliver such notice to such holders, deliver and use reasonable best efforts to cause counsel for Univar Solutions to deliver a
customary officer’s certificate and customary legal opinion (other than any opinions as to tax matters) relating to the delivery of such notice of
redemption by the Trustee to the holders of Senior Notes, to the Trustee under the Indenture, to the extent such certificate and opinion would not, in the
opinion of Univar Solutions, its counsel or the Trustee, conflict with the Indenture applicable law and would be accurate in light of the facts and
circumstances at the time delivered. On or prior to the Closing, Parent has agreed to make, or cause to be made, a deposit with the Trustee of funds
sufficient to pay in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of, accrued and unpaid interest through the applicable redemption date on, and
applicable redemption premiums related to, the Senior Notes so redeemed, together with payment of other fees and expenses payable by Univar Solutions
under the Indenture.
Termination of Credit Agreements
Univar Solutions has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to have delivered to Parent at least three business days prior to the Closing Date (A) an
appropriate and customary payoff letter with respect to its existing credit agreements specifying the aggregate payoff amount of Univar Solutions’
obligations (including principal, interest, fees, expenses, premium (if any) and other amounts payable in respect of such indebtedness) outstanding as of
the Closing and providing for a release of all liens and guarantees thereunder, including, in the case of any letters of credit or similar obligations, cash
collateralization of such obligations (with Parent and Merger Sub being responsible for paying all amounts under the payoff letters (including cash
collateralizing any letters of credit or similar obligations)) and (B) customary documentation evidencing the release of all liens with respect to the existing
credit agreements of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries (including any customary termination statements on Form UCC-3 or other customary releases).

For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers or mandatory rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses in favor of the employees, as the case may be, of Univar Solutions or its subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles or
certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents, or, in any contract set forth in the confidential disclosure letter provided by
Univar Solutions to Parent and Merger Sub will survive the Merger and continue at and after the Effective Time in full force and effect. For a period of six
years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation have agreed to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses provisions of Univar Solutions’ and any of its subsidiaries’ articles or certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents as in effect March 13, 2023 (other than with respect to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation) or in any

(provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period will continue until the final
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six-year period).
From and after the Effective Time, Parent has agreed to assume and honor and perform, and to cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries
to honor and perform, in accordance with their respective terms, the indemnity and other obligations described in this section.
For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the parties have agreed that the Surviving Corporation will, and that Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director or officer of Univar Solutions or any of its subsidiaries and each person who served
as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of Univar Solutions or its subsidiaries (each of which, together with such person’s heirs, executors or
administrators, and successors and assigns, we refer to as an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection
with such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of Univar
Solutions or its subsidiaries).
In the event of any such Action, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will have the right (but not the obligation) to control the defense thereof
after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not Parent or the Surviving Corporation
elect to control the defense of any such Action, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation will pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
such counsel selected by such Indemnified Party reasonably promptly after statements therefor are received in accordance with the indemnity and other
obligations described in this section, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Action, and (iii) none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries may settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Action, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent relates only to monetary damages or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent.
For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of Univar Solutions and
its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to matters arising at or before the Effective Time or provide
substitute policies for Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by
the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries, in either case, of
not less than the existing coverage and having other terms substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the insured
persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries
and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective
Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance), except that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies
more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries (the “Maximum Amount”). If the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the required insurance because its cost exceeds the Maximum Amount, it must obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium up to the

Maximum Amount for the years within such six-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing
Date, Univar Solutions may, at its option, purchase a six-year prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy for Univar Solutions and its
subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage
currently maintained by or for the benefit of Univar Solutions and its subsidiaries, with such tail policy to provide coverage in an amount not less than

occurred at or before the Effective Time. The parties have agreed that the Surviving Corporation will, and that Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
Parent has agreed to pay all reasonable and documented expenses, including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by
any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations described in this section, and such obligations will survive the consummation of
the Merger and are enforceable by each of the Indemnified Parties.

Univar Solutions Inc._20230502_DEFM14A_20844849_4658083.Pdf,PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Univar Solutions is required to submit a proposal to Univar
Solutions stockholders to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Univar Solutions’
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the
Compensation Proposal). This compensation is summarized in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Interests of Univar
Solutions’ Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer
Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, Univar Solutions is asking you to approve the following
resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Univar Solutions approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable to Univar Solutions’ named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Interests of Univar Solutions’ Executive Officers and Directors
in the Merger.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote
to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation
Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Univar Solutions. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is
completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this
Compensation Proposal.
Required Vote
Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock representing a majority of the
voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Compensation
Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal and (c) “broker non-votes” (if any)
will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Univar Solutions common stock represented by properly executed, timely
received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Univar Solutions stockholder returns a signed
proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Univar Solutions common stock represented by that proxy will be
counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be voted as recommended
by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”). If Univar
Solutions stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and
use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Univar Solutions stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we
had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would
be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares
to change their votes to votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not
present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person,
or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of
the Adjournment Proposal.

common stock as of April 28, 2023, unless otherwise indicated. As of April 28, 2023, Univar Solutions had 157,740,232 shares of common stock
outstanding.
The amounts and percentages of shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of
beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares voting power
or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of (or to direct the disposition of) such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial
owner of any securities that such person has a right to beneficially acquire within 60 days. Securities that can be acquired within 60 days are deemed to
be outstanding for purposes of computing such person’s ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any other person’s ownership
percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a
beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest. Percentage computations are based on shares of common stock
outstanding as of April 28, 2023.
The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of Univar Solutions common stock as of April 28, 2023, by each
person or group of affiliated persons known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of outstanding Univar Solutions common stock, each
member of the Board of Directors, each of Univar Solutions’ named executive officers, and all directors and executive officers of Univar Solutions as a
group. Except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table, each of the beneficial owners listed has, to Univar Solutions’ knowledge, sole voting

After the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (which we refer to as the “2023 Annual Meeting”), there will be no annual meetings of Univar

business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made. A stockholder nominating a director for election must provide the information regarding that nominee in the format required by the
Bylaws, and otherwise comply with all applicable requirements in the Bylaws.

Secretary, as provided in the Bylaws, no earlier than 150 calendar days and no later than 120 calendar days before the anniversary of the date that Univar
Solutions first mailed its proxy statement for the previous year’s Annual Meeting. For the 2024 Annual Meeting, the Secretary must receive this notice no
later than November 23, 2023, and no earlier than October 24, 2023, which dates are 120 calendar days and 150 calendar days, respectively, prior to March
22, 2024, the anniversary of the date that Univar Solutions mailed its proxy statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting; provided, that if the annual meeting is
not scheduled to be held on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, then notice by the stockholder to be timely must be

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Windsor Parent, L.P. (“Parent”) and its

contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against
certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-

business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; reviewed
the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the chemical distribution industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies

regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets
and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we
have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way
meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including a non-binding indication of interest for a transaction proposed by
a third party that may have resulted in a higher price per Share in cash than in the Transaction, which indication of interest you have advised us you have
determined not to pursue; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial
point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $36.15 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction
or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the
Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to
any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $36.15 in
cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing
any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on
the Company, Parent or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the
Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or
reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion
expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the
Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any
other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $36.15 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Shares.
 
Very truly yours,
(GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. LLC)

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”) has acted as financial advisor to Univar Solutions Inc. (the “Company”) in
connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 13, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), among Windsor
Parent, L.P. (“Parent”), Windsor Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company
which provides, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, as a result of which the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Transaction”). As set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement, as a result
of the Transaction, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of the Company,
other than Cancelled Shares, Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be
converted into the right to receive $36.15 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”).
You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates.
In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed certain publicly
available financial and other information concerning the Company, and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other
information relating to the Company prepared by management of the Company, including, at your direction, certain sensitivities to
the profitability and volume assumptions used in developing such forecasts. We have also held discussions with certain senior
officers and other representatives and advisors of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In
addition, we have (i) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock, (ii) to the extent publicly
available, compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with, to the extent publicly available, similar
information for certain other companies we considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent
publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed the Merger
Agreement, and (v) performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as we deemed appropriate.
We have not assumed responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any information, whether
publicly available or furnished to us, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in
connection with the rendering of our opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of our opinion, we have, with your knowledge and
permission, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. We have not conducted a physical
inspection of any of the properties or assets, and have not prepared, obtained or reviewed any independent evaluation or
appraisal of any of the

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any
securities of the Company or Merger Sub:
(i) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively,
the “Common Stock,” and each, a “Share”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Cancelled Shares, Owned Company
Shares, Dissenting Shares and Shares covered by Company Restricted Share Awards, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $36.15 per
Share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Section 2.1(a) and all Company Restricted Share Awards that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.3(a) shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Shares in accordance with Section 2.2.
(ii) Treatment of Cancelled Shares and Owned Company Shares. Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or
otherwise or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such shares held in a fiduciary, representative
or other capacity on behalf of third parties) (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor, and any Shares that are owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of the
Company (in each case, other than any such shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties) (any such shares,
collectively, “Owned Company Shares”), immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Person in the Surviving Corporation shall equal the ownership percentage such
Person’s Shares represent in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(b) Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have complied in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares and shall
not have waived, effectively withdrawn or lost such Person’s rights to appraisal under Delaware Law with respect to such shares (collectively, the
“Dissenting Shares”) shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.1. Such stockholders instead shall only be entitled to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in
accordance with the provisions of, and as provided by, Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Dissenting Share held by stockholders who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have waived, withdrawn or otherwise lost
 
A-7Table of Contents
the right to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.2. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days of becoming aware) of any demand for appraisal or payment Shares, any withdrawals of such demands
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time and any other instrument served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company relating to
Section 262 of Delaware Law and (ii) the right to participate in (at Parent’s sole cost and expense), and after the Effective Time direct and control, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such appraisals and demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the other party, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or instruments, or compromise or offer to settle or
settle any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise fail to comply with the provisions under
Section 262 of the DGCL or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. This Section 2.1(b), and not Section 5.11, shall govern with respect to such
appraisals and demands.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares of the Company shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.",152,153

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that
shall be appointed by Parent (and that is reasonably acceptable to the Company and approved in advance by the Company in writing (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) to act as a paying agent hereunder (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of the
Shares (other than the Cancelled Shares and Owned Company Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in
exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and Owned Company Shares), payable
upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares (“Certificates”) (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or noncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 (such cash being
referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually reasonably agree) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holder’s properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares
 
A-8Table of Contents
and (y) the Merger Consideration, and Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
(iii) Each of the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any and all amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.
Any amounts that are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and
instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
2. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter be delivered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Article 2 shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Shares.
(e) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to such time when such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares of the Company. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d).
(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
 
A-9

required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and (y) the Merger
Consideration.

referred to as the “Financing.” The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third-party beneficiary of, and entitled to enforce,
the Equity Commitment Letter.
(c) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Commitment Letters and any executed fee letters,
engagement letters and fee credit letters related thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, engagement letters and fee credit letters, to redaction
solely of fee amounts, “market flex” provisions, terms of “securities demand” provisions, pricing terms and pricing caps and other terms that are
customarily redacted (including any dates related thereto) (none of which could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to pay the Merger Amounts
(after taking into account any available Equity Financing)).
(d) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing
Entities and the Equity Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Debt Financing Entities or the Equity Investors to
reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing below the amount required to pay the Merger Amounts, including any condition or other
contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Financing pursuant to any “flex” provision. As of the

date of this Agreement and assuming the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time) or waived by the Closing, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions required to be satisfied by it in any of the
Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have Knowledge that any Debt Financing Entity or Equity Investor will not perform
its obligations thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, agreements or other Contracts of any kind to which Parent is a party
relating to the Commitment Letters or the Financing that could (i) adversely affect the conditionality or enforceability of, or termination rights under, the
Commitment Letters or the availability of the Financing or (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount required to pay the Merger
Amount, other than as expressly contained in the Commitment Letters and delivered to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.
(e) Assuming that the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the
Commitment Letters (including after giving effect to any “flex” provision in or related to the Debt Commitment Letters (including with respect to fees and
original issue discount)) shall provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters, including payment of (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any fees and expenses of or
payable by Parent or Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date and (iii) all amounts in respect of the repayment, redemption and
refinancing of all outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries required in connection with or pursuant to the
transactions described in this Agreement or the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the “Merger Amounts”).
(f) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, all the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of
any terms or conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) constitutes, or could constitute, a default, breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the
terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters have not been modified,
amended or altered and none of the respective commitments under any of the Commitment Letters have been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no termination, reduction, withdrawal, modification, amendment, alteration or rescission thereof is
contemplated (other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment
Letters as of the date of this Agreement, but solely to the extent that such addition would not effect a Prohibited Modification).
(g) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement.",173,174

and enforceable obligation of the Equity Investors in favor of the Company, enforceable by the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. The Equity Investors are not in default or breach under the terms and conditions of the Limited Guaranty and no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure
to satisfy a condition under the terms and conditions of the Limited Guaranty. The Equity Investors have access to sufficient capital to satisfy the full
amount of the guaranteed obligations under the Limited Guaranty.

Knowledge of the Company, is considering making an Alternative Proposal) with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate an Alternative Proposal (except, in each case, solely to (x) notify such Person as to the existence of the

reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information of the Company
or its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates to the third party or group making such Alternative Proposal, as well as its Representatives and Affiliates and
potential financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the
Company having provisions as to confidential treatment of information that are not materially less favorable to the Company than the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that (A) any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the execution of this
Agreement shall be deemed not materially less favorable to the Company and that any confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or
similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal) and (B) any confidentiality agreement entered into after

Section 5.3(b), including any public announcement that the Company or the Board of Directors has made any determination contemplated under this
Section 5.3(b) to take or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i).

recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to issue a press release that reaffirms publicly or otherwise reaffirm publicly
the Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of a request therefor in writing from Parent following the initial public disclosure of an Alternative
Proposal or any material modification to a publicly disclosed Alternative Proposal (other than of the type referred to in the following clause (v)) (or, if the
Company Meeting is scheduled to be held within five (5) Business Days of such request and such request is received at least one (1) Business Day prior
the date of the Company Meeting, prior to the date of the Company Meeting); provided, that Parent may not make any such request (and the Company
shall not be required to issue such press release or public statement) on more than one (1) occasion in respect of any initial disclosure of any Alternative
Proposal or any material modification of such Alternative Proposal, (iv) fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (v) fail to
recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer subject
to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (any such action, a “Change of Recommendation”). Anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Alternative Proposal
received by the Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.4, (x) make a Change of
Recommendation or (y) cause the Company to
 
A-38

terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i) in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation or cause any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i) unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have first determined in good faith, (1) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood that any such determination in and of itself shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation), (B)(1) the Company shall have given Parent
at least three (3) Business Days’ written notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation
or terminate this Agreement, which Superior Proposal Notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that
is the basis for the proposed action of the Board of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and a copy of any material written
proposal and the proposed definitive agreements (including, if applicable, financing documentation) for such Superior Proposal, if any, and (2) during
such three (3) Business Day notice period, if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner so that such
Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (3) at the end of such three (3) Business Day notice period, after taking into
account any commitments or binding proposals made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during the period following delivery of
such Superior Proposal Notice, the Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors that the
Alternative Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided that any material modifications or
amendments to the terms of such Alternative Proposal shall commence a new notice period under clause (B) of two (2) Business Days.
(d) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board
of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that any such determination in and of itself shall not be deemed a Change
of Recommendation); provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation unless (i) the
Company shall have given Parent at least three (3) Business Days’ written notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make
such a Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice shall include a description of the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) during such three
(3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall engage in good-faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would permit the Board of
Directors not to make such Change of Recommendation, and (iii) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period, after taking into account any
commitments or binding proposals made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during the period following delivery of such
Intervening Event Notice, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors to make such Change of Recommendation would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (it being understood that any such determination in and of itself shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation); provided that
any material changes relating to such Intervening Event shall commence a new notice period under this clause (d)(ii) and (iii) of two (2) Business Days.
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking or disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a
“stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that such
 
A-39

disclosure would be required under applicable Law; it being understood that (I) any such statement or disclosure made by the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.3(e), and (II) nothing in the foregoing will
be deemed to permit the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to effect a Change of Recommendation except in
accordance with Section 5.3(c) or Section 5.3(d). No disclosure or communication permitted pursuant to the foregoing sentence will be considered a
Change of Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event Notice. It is understood and agreed
that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate required public statement by the Company or the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof)
that describes the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making such Alternative Proposal, the material terms of such
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment,
qualification, or modification, or proposal by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the
Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Alternative Proposal; or (C) a Change of Recommendation.
(f) “Alternative Proposal” means any bona fide written indication of interest, proposal or offer made by any Person or group (other than by
Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates) relating to, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (i) merger, reorganization,
spin-off, share exchange (including a split-off), consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which such Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
twenty percent (20%) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (based on the fair market value thereof) or more than
twenty percent (20%) of the Shares, (ii) acquisition or exclusive license of more than twenty percent (20%) of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (based on the fair market value thereof), (iii) acquisition of more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding
Shares or more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of equity securities of the Company or (iv) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or group beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of equity securities of
the Company (in each case, other than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents).
(g) “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written Alternative Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this Agreement, substituting
in the definition thereof “fifty percent (50%)” for “twenty percent (20%)” in each place it appears, that the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and legal counsel, and taking into account all financial (including financing terms), legal, timing,
certainty of consummation, regulatory and other aspects and risks of such Alternative Proposal, would, if consummated in accordance with its terms,
result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any commitments or proposals made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of the Merger and this
Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(c)).
(h) “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development that is material and that (i) is unknown and not reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or any member thereof) as of the date hereof, or if known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or
any member thereof) as of the date hereof, the consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or any
member thereof) as of the date hereof and (ii) does not involve or relate to any Alternative Proposal; provided, however, that in no event shall the
following events, changes, occurrences or developments, in and of themselves, constitute an Intervening Event: (x) the receipt, existence of or terms of
any Alternative Proposal or (y) any change in the price or trading volume of the Shares or any other securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(provided that the underlying causes of such changes may constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an Intervening
Event).

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within twenty-five (25) Business Days after the date
hereof), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include the Recommendation, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the receipt thereof (with the assistance of Parent and Merger Sub), and shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s
stockholders promptly following the time the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company’s stockholders (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days after such time). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information concerning themselves and their Affiliates
as is customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in connection with a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, requested by the SEC or its staff or as the Company may reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of Recommendation has occurred or in connection with the
matters described in Section 5.3) provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (which comments shall be made
promptly) such document or response and shall consider in good faith, including in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by
Parent or its counsel. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by a party, which information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and the
Company shall, if it determines in good faith that such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, correct
(with the assistance of Parent) such information, and as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate same to the stockholders of the Company.
(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take all action required by the DGCL and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders promptly following the mailing
of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining (A) the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Meeting”) and (B) if mutually agreed, if there
has not been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, or at the Company’s election, if there has been a Change of Recommendation
in accordance with Section 5.3, a vote upon other matters, it being understood that the Company Meeting may also be the Company’s annual meeting of
stockholders, with the record date of the Company Meeting to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent and such meeting date being held no
later than thirty-five (35) days after the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders in accordance with Section 5.4(a) (or if such
day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), in each case unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
Section 5.3 and (ii) subject to a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval of the adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may
adjourn, recess or postpone the date of the Company Meeting (v) with the written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (w) for the absence of a quorum, (x) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company
reasonably believes necessary in order to
 
A-41Table of Contents
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, (y) if required by applicable Law or (z) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board of Directors has determined in good faith is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Company
Meeting (provided that, unless agreed in writing by Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or required by
applicable Law, the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting more than a total of four (4) times, and all such adjournments, recesses
or postponements shall be for periods of no more than ten (10) Business Days each). If the Board of Directors shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, then in submitting this Agreement to the Company’s stockholders, the Board of Directors may submit
this Agreement to the Company’s stockholders without the Recommendation and may communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to the
Company’s stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto. In no event will the record date of the
Company Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
required by applicable Law.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time (it being understood that this Section 5.5 shall not be deemed to prohibit
Parent from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating such Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms). For a period of one year following
the Effective Time (or upon an earlier termination of employment), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee who is employed
by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Company Employees”) (i) at least the same base wage rate or base
salary, as applicable, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) long- and short-term incentive opportunities (excluding any retention, change
in control or similar compensation, but including equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the long- and short-
term incentive opportunities (excluding any retention, change in control or similar compensation, but including equity-based compensation) in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, in lieu of equity awards, Parent may provide or cause to be provided, cash-based awards
having substantially comparable aggregate value as (but which may have different vesting terms and performance conditions than) the equity awards in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other employee benefits (excluding any equity-based, long-term incentive, retention, change in
control or similar one-time or special benefits or arrangements, severance, non-qualified deferred compensation, post-retirement health and welfare
benefits and defined benefit pension benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Company Employees whose terms and conditions of employment
are subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement, Parent shall, or cause its Subsidiaries to, instead comply with the terms and conditions of each such
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, in a manner consistent with applicable Law.
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.5(a), (i) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company
Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are not subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement and whose employment terminates during the
one (1)-year period following the Effective Time severance benefits equal to the severance benefits that would have been provided to the Company
Employee under the Company’s severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Company Employee’s execution
and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of Parent and its Affiliates in substantially the same form as attached to the severance policy,
plan or agreement applicable to such Company Employee, and (ii) during such one (1)-year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered
to each Company Employee shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid or benefits
provided to such Company Employee.

(i) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and determining level of benefits) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, retiree health or welfare plan or to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (x) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (y) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at
or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.
(d) The Company may implement a retention program in accordance with Section 5.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(e) The Company shall coordinate in advance with Parent between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time regarding any broad-
based communication with current or former Company and its Subsidiaries employees or any written communication with any current or former employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to, in either case, compensation or benefits to be provided subsequent to the Effective Time, and any such
communication shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being
understood that prior coordination and approval shall not be required with respect to any such communication the substance of which Parent previously
has approved in writing (and which communication does not otherwise materially deviate from such substance).
(f) To the extent that any material pre-Merger employee notification or consultation requirements with respect to the Merger are imposed by
applicable Law or under any Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate to ensure that such notification or consultation requirements
are complied with prior to the Closing Date.
(g) Upon Parent’s reasonable request from time to time, the Company shall, a reasonable period of time following receipt of such request
(but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following receipt of such request), provide Parent with the then-most recent report and reasonable,
available back-up information relating to calculations under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to the Merger, including any non-compete
valuations.
(h) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this Section 5.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former director, employee or consultant or any

Parent shall assume and honor and perform, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.9.

by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers having at least an “A”
rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company and its

to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing in
an amount sufficient to fund the Merger Amounts on the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof,
including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing required to pay the Merger Amounts (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) (which, with respect to the bridge
facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing required to

satisfy the Merger Amounts (after taking into account any Equity Financing)) (the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any related fee letter) and without any Prohibited
Modification, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions required to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements and
complying with all of its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and Definitive Agreements in a timely and
diligent manner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements (other than the consummation of the Merger, those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing and those
conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, and other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing and, with respect to
the Equity Financing, the availability of the Debt Financing) have been satisfied, Parent shall fully enforce the counterparties’ obligations under the
Commitment Letters and cause the Equity Investors to and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Entities to comply with their
respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the Financing.

any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, waiver or remedy (A) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (B) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the

parties to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified relative to the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the corresponding Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (D) could otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, impair, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the effects described in clauses (A) through (D), collectively, the “Prohibited Modifications”); provided that the Debt Commitment Letters
may be amended to add additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment
Letters as of the date of this Agreement so long as any such addition would not effect a Prohibited Modification, or (ii) terminate any Commitment Letter
or any Definitive Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver to
any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement.
(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing required to pay the Merger Amounts becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company in writing of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this
Section 5.10(c), use reasonable best efforts, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts, to arrange and obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing for any such unavailable portion from the same or alternative
sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing, to pay the Merger
Amounts, and which does not include any Prohibited Modifications. Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice (i) of any actual
breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement of which Parent becomes
aware and (ii) upon receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Entity or Equity Investor or other financing
source with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing, including any Alternative Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 5.10 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to pay
any fees or any interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (after giving effect to the
market flex provisions), or agree to

terms materially less favorable to Parent or the Company than the terms contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date
hereof (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent
and Merger Sub within this Section 5.10 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether or not the Financing, any Alternative Financing or any other financing is available.

Letters or the Definitive Agreements, in each case pursuant to this Section 5.10 and without any Prohibited Modification, references to the “Financing,”,

to use their respective reasonable best efforts, and shall direct its and their Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, to provide customary
cooperation in connection with the arrangement and implementation of the Debt Financing, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in writing,

management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number of customary meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting

otherwise in this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by them or their respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall reimburse,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities and losses

modify such obligations.
(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Financial
Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Financial Information is (i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable

financing markets, request the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under Section 5.10(e) at any time, and from time to time and on multiple
occasions, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable
as to each attempt to access the markets (it being understood and agreed that once the “Marketing Period” has commenced and then been completed in
accordance with the definition thereof, there shall not be a subsequent “Marketing Period” hereunder). Parent agrees to provide the Company drafts of all
Offering Documents and all marketing materials for the Debt Financing with a reasonable time to review such documents and materials, and subject to
Parent’s compliance with such obligation, the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to review all such Offering Documents and marketing
materials and identify for Parent any information contained therein that it reasonably believes constitutes material non-public information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or their respective securities. If the Company identifies any such information (“Identified MNPI”),
and such information is customarily included in offering documents or marketing materials for debt financing of the type consistent with the Debt
Financing, is reasonably requested by Parent to be included in the Offering Documents or marketing materials for the Debt Financing and does not
include information as to which the Company reasonably objects (any such Identified MNPI, “Acceptable MNPI”), then the Company shall file a Current
Report on Form 8-K containing such material non-public information. Parent shall remove all such Identified MNPI that is not Acceptable MNPI from
such Offering Documents and marketing materials.

Representatives pursuant to Section 5.10 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company hereby consents to

Article 7 (and pursuing damages before or after such termination subject to Section 7.3) and (z) subject to Section 7.3, by seeking the remedies provided
for in this Section 8.5, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
