The Company, Opco, Parent, Merger Sub and Opco Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement on
October 16, 2022. A copy of the Merger Agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, at the effective time of the
Company Merger (the “Effective Time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company
continuing

as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and at the effective time of the Opco
Merger (the “Opco Merger Effective Time”), Opco Merger Sub will merge with and into Opco with Opco
continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. From time to time in this proxy
statement, we refer to the Company as it will exist after the completion of the Company Merger as the
“Surviving Corporation” and to Opco as it will exist after the completion of the Opco Merger as the “Surviving
Opco.”
At the Effective Time, (i) without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class A common
stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company
Shares (as defined below) or any shares of Class A common stock that is held by holders who have not voted
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly
exercised appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”)),
will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash without
interest (the “Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes, (ii) without any action by any
Archaea stockholder, each share of Class B common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be automatically canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor (each holder of Class B common stock also holds an equivalent number of Class A
Units of Opco (“Opco Units”)), (iii) without any action by any Company stockholder, each share of common
stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be canceled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation and (iv) each share of Archaea common stock that is (a) held by
the Company as treasury stock or (b) owned by the Parent, Merger Sub and Opco Merger Sub (together, the
“Parent Entities”) or any of their subsidiaries, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
((a) and (b), collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”) will automatically be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.
At the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, (i) each Opco
Unit held by a holder other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the “Specified Opco Holders”) issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled,
extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration,
less any applicable withholding taxes, (ii) each Opco Unit held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time (the “Owned Opco Units”) shall become an equivalent
number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco held by the Surviving Corporation and
(iii) all limited liability company interests of Opco Merger Sub will be automatically canceled, extinguished and
converted into limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco, such that the aggregate number of
limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco to be held by Parent immediately following the Opco
Merger Effective Time will represent the same percentage of the outstanding limited liability company interests
of the Surviving Opco immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time as the percentage of Opco
Units held by the Specified Opco Holders immediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time. As a result,
immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, based on the number of Opco Units issued and
outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement, approximately 30.9% of the limited liability company
interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by Parent, and approximately 69.1% of the limited liability
company interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by the Company (and accordingly indirectly by
Parent).
Immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each of the warrants to purchase shares of
Class A common stock (the “Warrants”), which were issued by the Company in a private placement under the
Warrant Agreement, dated October 21, 2020 (the “Warrant Agreement”), by and among Rice Acquisition
Corp., Rice Acquisition Holdings, LLC and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, will
be redeemed for cash in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to
Warrant Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2022 (the “Warrant Agreement Amendment”), by and among the
Company, Opco and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, which provides that immediately following
the Opco Merger Effective Time, each Warrant that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be automatically redeemed for the right to receive an amount, in cash, equal to (i) the
Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement and which is
currently $11.50) as reduced pursuant to the calculation provided in Section 4.4 of the Warrant Agreement,
without interest.

or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement to, the person making such
Acquisition Proposal.
The Archaea Board generally is not permitted under the Merger Agreement to change its
recommendation to the Company’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement. However, prior to the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by Archaea stockholders, the Archaea Board is permitted to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger Agreement — No-Shop; Archaea Board Recommendation Change”) in response to an Intervening
Event (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement — No-Shop;
Archaea Board Recommendation Change”) or to accept a Superior Proposal if, in either case, the Archaea
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Any such Company Board Recommendation Change is subject to the procedures set forth in the Merger
Agreement, including that the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and its representatives, if
requested by Parent, for four business days (or three business days following an amended Acquisition
Proposal) to make amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related documents
so that, as applicable, the Archaea Board’s fiduciary duties no longer require it to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event or the Acquisition Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal.

Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Appraisal Rights (page 89),"Appraisal Rights (page 89)
Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, Archaea stockholders who continuously hold shares of Archaea
common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands, and who otherwise comply
with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
Archaea common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. The “fair value” of
shares of Archaea common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the
same as or less than the Merger Consideration that stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under
the terms of the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Archaea common stock.
The right to seek appraisal will be lost if an Archaea stockholder votes “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. However, abstaining or voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in itself
sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to perfect such rights. To
exercise appraisal rights, Archaea stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their
shares must so advise the Company by submitting a written demand for appraisal to the Company prior to the
taking of the vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, must continuously own
shares of Archaea common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time and must
otherwise strictly follow the applicable procedures and requirements prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. A
person having a beneficial interest in shares of Archaea common stock held of record in the name of another
person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, may perfect appraisal rights if such beneficial owner
(i) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is
made, (ii) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provides an
address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and the office of
Register in Chancery. In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Archaea stockholders that may
wish to pursue appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors.",17,17

The receipt of cash by a holder of Class A common stock who is a U.S. holder (as defined in the section
of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) in exchange
for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign
income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a U.S. holder, you will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the
Merger (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and your adjusted tax basis in
the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. If you are a holder of Class A common stock who is a
non-U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Material

transaction to you under non-U.S. tax laws, and you are encouraged to seek tax advice regarding such matters.
Because individual circumstances may differ, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the
particular tax effects to you.
You are urged to read the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal

Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions
regarding the Special Meeting and the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that
may be important to you as a holder of Archaea common stock. You should read the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to
in this proxy statement.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On October 16, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary, Opco, entered into the Merger Agreement with
Parent, Merger Sub and Opco Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Opco Merger Sub will merge with and into
Opco with Opco continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Archaea Board
in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Adjournment Proposal.
As a holder of Archaea common stock, what will I receive in the Merger?
Each share of Class A common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any shares of Class A common stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent, Merger Sub, Opco Merger Sub or any other subsidiaries thereof, or any shares of Class A common
stock as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with Delaware law) will be
automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any
applicable withholding taxes.
Each share of Class B common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be automatically canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid
therefor. Each holder of Class B common stock also holds an equivalent number of Opco Units. Each Opco Unit
held by a holder other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding
taxes. The Merger Consideration represents the aggregate consideration payable in respect of an Opco Unit and
its corresponding share of Class B common stock.
The exchange of shares of Class A common stock and Opco Units for cash pursuant to the Merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a more detailed description of the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You are urged to consult your tax advisor for a full
understanding of how the Merger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of the Class A common stock?
The Merger Consideration of $26.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 54% over the Class A
common stock’s closing share price on October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the transaction
announcement. On November 11, 2022, the most recent practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement,
the closing price of the Class A common stock was $25.75 per share.
What is the consideration payable in respect of the Class B common stock and Opco Units?
Archaea has an “up-C” structure, whereby the Company’s only assets are its equity interests in Opco. The
Class B common stock represents a non-economic interest in the Company, and each holder of shares of Class B
common stock holds an equivalent number of Opco Units, which represent such holder’s direct economic
interest in Opco. As such, (i) in the Merger, each share of Class B common stock that is issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor, and (ii) in the Opco Merger, each Opco Unit held by a holder
other than
1
1Table of Contents
the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Opco
Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. The Merger Consideration
represents the aggregate consideration payable in respect of an Opco Unit and its corresponding share of
Class B common stock.
What will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger?
Each Vested RSU, Vested PSU, Director RSU, Deemed Vested RSU and Deemed Vested PSU will, at the
Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Class A
common stock subject to such Vested RSU, Vested PSU, Director RSU, Deemed Vested RSU and Deemed Vested
PSU, respectively, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with performance vesting conditions for Deemed
Vested PSUs being deemed achieved at maximum levels of performance) and (ii) $26.00.
Each Unvested RSU and Unvested PSU will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into a
Deferred Cash RSU Award or Deferred Cash PSU Award, respectively. Each Deferred Cash RSU Award or
Deferred Cash PSU Award will, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable vesting dates,
vest and be payable on the earlier of (a) the same time as the Unvested RSU or Unvested PSU for which the
Deferred Cash RSU Award or Deferred Cash PSU Award, respectively, was exchanged would have vested and
been payable pursuant to its service-based vesting schedule and (b) the first anniversary of the closing date, in
each case, subject to full accelerated vesting upon a termination of employment by the Company without
“cause” or a resignation for “good reason.”
What will happen to the Warrants?
Each of the Warrants will be redeemed for cash immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time in
accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, which provides
that immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each Warrant that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically redeemed for the right to receive an amount, in cash,
equal to (i) the Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement and
which is currently $11.50) as reduced pursuant to the calculation provided in Section 4.4 of the Warrant
Agreement, without interest.
When and where is the Special Meeting?
The special meeting will be held virtually on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at 7:00 AM, Central time.
Stockholders will be able to attend the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LFG2022SM and by using the 16-digit control number included in their
proxy materials. We are conducting the Special Meeting solely online so our stockholders can participate from
any geographic location with Internet connectivity. We believe this enhances accessibility to the Special
Meeting for all of our stockholders and reduces the carbon footprint of our activities. We have worked to offer
the same rights and opportunities to participate as would be provided at an in-person meeting, while providing
an online experience available to all stockholders regardless of their location.
Instructions on how to attend and participate in the Special Meeting virtually are posted at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LFG2022SM. You should ensure that you have a strong Internet
connection and allow plenty of time to log-in and ensure that you can hear streaming audio prior to the start of
the Special Meeting. We will offer live technical support for all stockholders attending the Special Meeting.
Technical support phone numbers will be available on the virtual only meeting platform at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LFG2022SM.
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
Only holders of record of common stock as of the close of business on November 9, 2022, the record date
for the Special Meeting, are entitled to vote the shares of common stock they held as of the record date at the
Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 120,645,305 shares of common stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. On each of the proposals presented at the Special Meeting, each
holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held by such stockholder on the
record date.

Table of Contents
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote at the Special Meeting?
Yes. If you are an Archaea stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting virtually via the
Internet at the virtual meeting website on December 13, 2022, and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you
sign and return your proxy card. If you are an Archaea stockholder of record, you will need your assigned
control number to vote shares electronically at the Special Meeting. The control number can be found on the
proxy card.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at
the Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and complete a virtual
ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or
other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote
your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee.
What proposals will be considered at the Special Meeting?
At the Special Meeting, holders of Archaea common stock will be asked to consider and vote on the
following proposals:
•
        
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”); and
•
        
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting.
Pursuant to Archaea’s bylaws, the only business that will be transacted at the Special Meeting are the
above two proposals, as stated in the accompanying notice of the Special Meeting.
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The
inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The
inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a
quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or
postponement of the meeting to another date or time.
What vote of Archaea stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date.
Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to
vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other
nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal shall be determined by the majority of votes cast by the
holders of common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, shares
deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street
name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee),
abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
13
Table of Contents
What is a “broker non-vote”?
If a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee
does not provide the organization that holds the owner’s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under
applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner’s shares may generally vote on “discretionary” matters
but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and
other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide
discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary
authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of
relevant shares. Archaea does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules
applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on
proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is
considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of
common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee as to how to vote your shares of common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
How does the Archaea Board recommend that I vote?
The Archaea Board recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal. For a discussion of the factors that the Archaea Board considered in determining to recommend that
Archaea stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, see the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger — Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Archaea Board.” In addition, in considering
the recommendation of the Archaea Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that
certain of the Company’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. See the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before the Special Meeting?
The record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or
transfer your shares of common stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your
right to vote such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger Consideration will
pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares of Class A common stock or Opco Units (and
corresponding shares of Class B common stock). In order to receive the Merger Consideration in connection
with the Merger, you must hold your shares of Class A common stock or Opco Units (and corresponding shares
of Class B common stock) through the Effective Time or Opco Merger Effective Time, respectively.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy
statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy
card.”
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted
on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal and
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents
How do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In that case,
this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.
If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the
Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid
reply envelope. You may also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the Special Meeting. Even if you
plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged to submit your vote by proxy as early as possible to
ensure that your shares will be represented. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these
methods, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Special Meeting — Voting Procedures.”
If you are a holder of record of shares of common stock and you submit a proxy card but do not direct
how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of each of the Merger
Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other
nominee?
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner”
of shares of common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you
by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of
record.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in “street name,” you must follow the
instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or other
nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing the voting
instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement. Without providing
those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or
fail to give voting instructions to your broker, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions, failures to vote and failures to give
voting instructions to your broker will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?
Yes. If you are a stockholder with shares of common stock registered in your name, you may revoke your
proxy at any time prior to the time it is voted by:
•
        
filing with our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;
•
        
properly casting a new vote via the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the
Internet or telephone voting facilities described under “The Special Meeting — Voting Procedures”;
•
        
duly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Corporate
Secretary; or
•
        
attending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the meeting (although
attendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices
at Archaea Energy Inc., 4444 Westheimer Road, Suite G450, Houston, Texas 77027, Attention: Corporate
Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting. If you want to revoke your proxy by sending a
new proxy card or an instrument revoking the proxy to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new
proxy card or instrument revoking the proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the
Special Meeting.

Table of Contents
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in “street name,” you must contact your
bank, broker or other nominee to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares electronically at
the Special Meeting.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or
multiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of common stock in more than
one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which
you hold shares of common stock. If you are a holder of common stock of record and your shares of common
stock are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit your proxy
and/or voting instructions for each set of materials that you receive to ensure that all your shares of common
stock are voted.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
If available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. We
intend to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the
Special Meeting. All reports that Archaea files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
If the Merger is completed, holders of Archaea common stock who continuously hold shares of Archaea
common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands, and who otherwise comply
with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares
of Archaea common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Class A common stock or Opco Units (and
corresponding share of Class B common stock), exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if
any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the
amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the
entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Holders of Archaea common stock who wish to seek appraisal of
their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL
for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 of the
DGCL regarding appraisal rights is accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available
website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the
section of this proxy statement titled “Appraisal Rights.”
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
We are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and the parties to the Merger
Agreement are targeting completing the Merger by the end of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of
the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger
Agreement, some of which are outside of our control.
What effect will the Merger have on Archaea?
If the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Archaea, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease, and Archaea will continue to exist following the Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Following completion of the Merger, shares of Class A common stock will be
delisted from the NYSE, and the registration of shares of Class A common stock under the Exchange Act will be
terminated.

Table of Contents
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, the holders of Archaea common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Archaea
common stock or Opco Units in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company would remain an
independent public company and stockholders would continue to own their shares of Archaea common stock
and Opco Units. The Class A common stock would continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed
and traded on the NYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Archaea may be obligated
to pay to Parent a termination fee. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger Agreement — Termination Fees and Expenses.”
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance
notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of
the meeting and proxy card. If your shares are held in “street name,” you will receive your voting instruction
form from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will return your voting instruction form to your bank,
broker or other nominee. You should vote on and sign each proxy card or voting instruction form you receive as
discussed above. To request that only one copy of any of these materials be mailed to your household, please
contact your bank, broker or other nominee.

This proxy statement, and any documents to which Archaea refers to in this proxy statement, may contain
“forward-looking statements,” which include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts,
such as statements regarding our expectations, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,”
“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “aim,” “potential,”
“continue,” “ongoing,” “goal,” “can,” “seek,” “target” or the negative of these terms or other similar
expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking
statements are based on management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently
available to, the Company. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as
statements about the consummation of the Merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. These statements are
only predictions. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its then-current
expectations and projections about future events and financial trends as well as the beliefs and assumptions of
management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which
involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company’s control. Because such statements are based on
expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ
materially from those projected and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties,
including, but not limited to:
•
        
the risk that the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect
the Company’s business and the price of Class A common stock;
•
        
the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the receipt
of certain regulatory approvals (or the imposition of any conditions, limitations or restrictions on
such approvals);
•
        
the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger;
•
        
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the
termination of the Merger Agreement, including in circumstances requiring the Company to pay a
termination fee of $114.5 million;
•
        
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on the Company’s business
relationships, operating results and business generally;
•
        
risks that the Merger disrupts the Company’s current plans and operations;
•
        
the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, and maintain relationships with key business
partners, customers and others with whom it does business, in light of the Merger;
•
        
risks related to diverting management’s attention from the Company’s ongoing business operations;
•
        
unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the Merger;
•
        
potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the parties to the Merger
Agreement or their respective directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes
related thereto;
•
        
continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions;
•
        
certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company’s ability to
pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;
•
        
unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism,
war or hostilities or the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s response to any of the
aforementioned factors; and
•
        
the impact of adverse general and industry-specific economic and market conditions.

After careful consideration, the Archaea Board unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and
consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in the Voting
Agreement, the Warrant Agreement Amendment, the Opco LLC Agreement Amendment and the Unitholder

and the consummation of the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in
the Voting Agreement, the Warrant Agreement Amendment, the Opco LLC Agreement Amendment and the
Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter; (iii) determined that the Voting Agreement and the Warrant
Agreement Amendment are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and
approved the Voting Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar laws are not applicable to the Merger
Agreement; (iv) approved the Opco LLC Agreement Amendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement
Letter; (v) resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL; and (vi) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by
the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders
vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

adoption of the Merger Agreement, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Reasons for

Only holders of common stock of record as of the close of business on November 9, 2022, the record date
for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote the shares of common stock they held on the
record date at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 120,645,305 shares of common
stock (consisting of 83,375,980 shares of Class A common stock and 37,269,325 shares of Class B common stock)
were issued and outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting. On each of the proposals
presented at the Special Meeting, each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common
stock held by such stockholder on the record date. The adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
common stock requires
20Table of Contents
the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of
Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the close of business on the
record date, voting together as a single class, at the Special Meeting.
A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for examination during
ordinary business hours by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the Special Meeting beginning 10 days
prior to the Special Meeting and ending on the date of the Special Meeting at our principal executive offices
located at 4444 Westheimer Road, Suite G450, Houston, Texas 77027. Such list will also be available at the virtual

Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Quorum,"Quorum
The presence, in person or by proxy, at the Special Meeting of at least a majority of all outstanding shares
of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or 60,322,653 shares of common stock, is necessary to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum shall fail to attend the Special Meeting, the
Special Meeting may be adjourned to another time and/or place by the chairman of the meeting or by a majority
of votes cast by the holders of common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting
in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine
whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum.
If a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee
does not provide the organization that holds his, her or its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under
applicable rules, the organization that holds such shares may generally vote on “discretionary” matters but
cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and
other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide
discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary
authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of
the relevant shares. Archaea does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules
applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide them with discretionary authority to vote on
proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is
considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of
common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee as to how to vote your shares of common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the
adjournment or postponement of the meeting to another date, time and/or place.

Approval of the Merger Proposal
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of stockholders
holding a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the close of
business on the record date, voting together as a single class, at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, shares of
common stock deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote
or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other
nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal is a condition to the
consummation of the Merger.
21Table of Contents
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal shall be determined by the majority of votes cast by the
holders of common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, shares
deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street
name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee),
abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement. The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Proposal is
approved at the Special Meeting.

As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, at the Special Meeting, holders of Archaea common stock
will consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger cannot be completed without
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of Archaea stockholders. You are urged to
carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the Merger Agreement
and the Merger, including the information set forth under the sections of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety.
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Archaea common stock as of the close of business on the record date. Accordingly,
shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a
“street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other
nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal.
The Archaea Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal.

We are asking that you approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if
necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Archaea is asking stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Archaea Board to
vote in favor of any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, as determined by the
Company, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time
of the Special Meeting.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal shall be determined by the majority of votes cast by the
holders of common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, shares
deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street
name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee),
abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement. Archaea does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the
Special Meeting.
The Archaea Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

The Company, Opco, Parent, Merger Sub and Opco Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement on
October 16, 2022. A copy of the Merger Agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, and at the Opco Merger Effective Time, Opco Merger Sub will merge with and into
Opco with Opco continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
At the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class A common
stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company
Shares or any Dissenting Company Shares) will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Also, at the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class B
common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. Each holder of Class B
common stock also holds an equivalent number of Opco Units.
Also, at the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, (i) each share of common
stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be canceled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) each share of Archaea common stock that is (a) held by the Company
as treasury stock or (b) owned by the Parent Entities or any of their subsidiaries, in each case as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will automatically be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.
At the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, each Opco Unit
held by a holder other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right
to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Also, at the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, (i) each
Opco Unit held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time
shall become an equivalent number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco held by the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) all limited liability company interests of Opco Merger Sub will be automatically
canceled, extinguished and converted into limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco, such that
the aggregate number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco to be held by Parent
immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time will represent the same percentage of the outstanding
limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time
as the percentage of Opco Units held by the Specified Opco Holders immediately prior to the Opco Merger
Effective Time. As a result, immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, based on the number of Opco
Units issued and outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement, approximately 30.9% of the limited liability
company interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by Parent, and approximately 69.1% of the limited
liability company interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by the Company (and accordingly
indirectly by Parent).
Immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each of the Warrants will be redeemed for cash in
accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, which provides
that immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each Warrant that is issued and outstanding
immediately

prior to the Effective Time will be automatically redeemed for the right to receive an amount, in cash, equal to
(i) the Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement and which is
currently $11.50) as reduced pursuant to the calculation provided in Section 4.4 of the Warrant Agreement,
without interest.
Background of the Merger",37,38
Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger
Agreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the
Board, the Company’s management, the Company’s financial advisors or legal advisors, Parent or any other
person.
The Board, together with the Company’s management and with the assistance of the Company’s advisors,
regularly evaluates the Company’s historical performance, future growth prospects and strategic plan and
considers (i) various financial and strategic opportunities available to the Company, including potential
acquisitions, joint ventures, business combinations, financings and other similar transactions, and (ii) other
ways to enhance stockholder value and the Company’s performance and prospects, taking into account various
factors, including the business, competitive, regulatory, financing and economic environment and developments
in the Company’s industry. As a result, since the completion of the Company’s business combination with Aria
Energy LLC and Archaea Energy LLC in September 2021, representatives of the Company have from time to time
engaged in discussions with representatives of other companies in, or interested in, the biogas industry, as well
as financial sponsors regarding such financial and strategic opportunities available to the Company. In addition,
Parent and the Company are party to the Mavrix LLC joint venture (the “Mavrix Joint Venture”), and, from time to
time, Parent and the Company have met to discuss matters relating to the Mavrix Joint Venture.
On February 8, 2022, members of Company management met with representatives of Parent during an
industry event, during which time the parties discussed the biogas industry generally and matters relating to the
Mavrix Joint Venture.
On April 28, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase
NextGen Power Holdings LLC (“INGENCO”) for $215 million in cash.
On May 5, 2022, the Company announced a joint venture (the “Lightning Joint Venture”) with Republic
Services, Inc. (“Republic”) to develop RNG projects across the country. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive
agreements governing the Lightning Joint Venture, the Company was required to contribute approximately
$800 million to the joint venture over the course of five years.
On June 3, 2022, members of Company management and representatives of Parent had a call to discuss,
among other things, the biogas industry generally, during which time Parent expressed an interest in expanding
in the biogas industry and learning more about the Company’s business. Representatives of Parent expressed
interest in a variety of potential transactions and projects with the Company. No financial or other material terms
of any potential transaction with the Company were discussed on the call.
On June 16, 2022, during a meeting between members of Company management and representatives of
Parent to discuss matters relating to the Mavrix Joint Venture, representatives of Parent again expressed an
interest in the Company’s business beyond that joint venture, and, at the request of Parent, the Company
discussed with representatives of Parent publicly available information relating to the Company’s broader
business and financial results.
In addition, over the course of the summer of 2022 and after the announcement of the Lightning Joint
Venture, a number of financial parties, including parties referred to herein as “Party A”, “Party B”, and “Party C”,
met with members of Company management and Daniel J. Rice, IV, Chair of the Board, to discuss a variety of
topics, including the biogas industry generally and the Company’s business. During the course of such
discussions, these financial parties expressed an interest in the Company, including in potentially participating in
a variety of potential transactions with the Company, ranging from (i) financing transactions to finance the
INGENCO purchase, the Lightning Joint Venture capital contributions and other capital expenditures within the
Company’s development plan to (ii) potential strategic transactions to allow such financial parties to
meaningfully participate in the growing biogas industry. No financial or other material terms of a potential
acquisition of the Company were discussed at any of these meetings.
30Table of Contents
On June 24, 2022, given the increasing interest from the various parties noted above in a wide range of
transactions with the Company, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of
Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), legal advisor to the Company, in attendance to discuss the interest of such
parties, including whether any engagement with such parties in respect of strategic transactions was appropriate
at the time in light of the Board’s fiduciary duties. During this meeting, the Board discussed the outreach from
Party A, Party B, Party C and Parent. Representatives of Kirkland also provided the Board with a review of the
Board’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in the context of the interest expressed by third parties in
exploring strategic alternatives with the Company and the Board’s potential consideration of strategic
alternatives. Next, the Board discussed and considered the potential benefits and risks of conducting a targeted
assessment to help the Board determine how best to maximize value for stockholders, including considerations
such as the relative scarcity of RNG assets at the Company’s scale, which could drive further interest in the
Company as part of a marketed process given the overall market dynamics. The Board also discussed and
considered the risks to the Company and its business inherent in a potential market check, including demands on
management’s time and attention and the risk of leaks. Taking into consideration the foregoing, the Board
determined that an initial step of engaging with a financial advisor to assist the Board in considering the benefits
and risks of a targeted market check was warranted, including to provide additional perspective for the Board
and the Company’s management in ongoing interactions with the various parties expressing interest in engaging
with the Company. At the end of the meeting, the Board authorized Company management and Mr. Rice to
engage with potential financial advisors to meet with the Board.
Over the course of the next several days, Company management and Mr. Rice considered the engagement
of several financial advisors to meet with the Board to discuss a potential market check process and determined
to introduce representatives of BofA Securities to the Board following a meeting between representatives of
BofA Securities and Company management where representatives of BofA Securities noted that significant time
and attention would be dedicated to the potential engagement by its senior leadership team with significant
experience in the energy and infrastructure spaces.
On June 30, 2022, during a call between members of Company management and representatives of Parent
to discuss matters relating to the Mavrix Joint Venture, representatives of Parent asked, and Company
management answered, a number of questions relating to the Company’s business generally and the Company’s
funding obligations relating to the Lightning Joint Venture.
That same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of Kirkland in
attendance and, for a portion of such meeting, representatives of BofA Securities in attendance to interview
representatives of BofA Securities as a potential financial advisor to the Board. During its meeting with the
Board, BofA Securities highlighted its experience in the energy and infrastructure industries as well as its ability
to connect with senior members of various potential strategic and financial parties that might be interested in a
strategic transaction with the Company. Following such meeting, the Board, having considered BofA Securities’
credentials, expertise and experience, determined to retain BofA Securities to act as financial advisor to the Board
in connection with the Board’s review of strategic alternatives. The Board also discussed potential next steps,
including the need for the Company to prepare financial forecasts in order for BofA Securities to perform a
financial analysis of the Company, and directed Company management to prepare such financial forecasts.
Over the course of the next several weeks, Company management developed financial forecasts as
previously directed by the Board in order to permit BofA Securities to present the Board with a preliminary
financial analysis and also to assist in the Board’s consideration of whether a market check might be warranted.
On July 13, 2022, representatives of Parent had a call with a member of the Company’s management to
discuss Parent’s questions regarding the Company’s financial metrics and ownership structure.
On July 24, 2022, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each of
Kirkland and BofA Securities in attendance to review the financial forecast prepared by Company management,
to review BofA Securities’ preliminary financial analysis and to discuss potential bidders that would most likely
be interested in a potential acquisition of the Company. During the meeting, the Board reviewed the financial
forecast prepared by the Company’s management at the direction of the Board (the “July Forecasts,” as
described further in the section entitled “— Certain Financial Projections”) and engaged in a discussion
regarding the key assumptions and other factors underlying such financial forecasts. Representatives of BofA
Securities also reviewed BofA Securities’ preliminary financial analysis based on the July Forecasts and provided
an overview of conditions in the debt and equity markets and mergers and acquisitions market. The Board also
discussed with Company management
31
Table of Contents
and advisors the potential bidders, both financial and strategic, including the parties noted above, that would
likely have both the interest and financial capacity to engage in a potential acquisition of the Company, as well
as the risks and benefits of reaching out to multiple bidders and potential impediments or challenges associated
with such parties pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company. Following discussion by the Board
highlighting the benefits and risks of assessing the Company’s valuation in a potential sale through the
engagement with a targeted group of potential buyers, the Board directed Company management to begin, with
the assistance of BofA Securities, exploring a process for a potential sale with a targeted group of financial
parties and strategic parties and to report back to the Board with a process timeline and suggested potential
financial and strategic bidders to involve in such a process.
On July 26, 2022, the Company signed an engagement letter with BofA Securities.
On July 28, 2022, representatives of Parent had a call with a member of the Company’s management. During
the call, representatives of Parent informed the Company that Parent was considering submitting a preliminary
non-binding proposal for the acquisition of the Company, and representatives of the Company informed
representatives of Parent that the Company had retained BofA Securities to act as financial advisor to the Board
and that representatives of BofA Securities would reach out to Parent to discuss next steps, if the Board
determined such actions appropriate.
On August 2, 2022, the Board met at a regularly scheduled meeting with members of Company management
and representatives of each of Kirkland and BofA Securities in attendance to further discuss considerations
relating to conducting a market check and to refine a list of potential bidders to involve in such a market check.
The Board specifically discussed the pros and cons of running a targeted market check and considered a number
of factors in determining the scope of a potential market check process, including (i) the business risk associated
with involving strategic buyers and potential disclosure of confidential information to industry participants,
(ii) the risk of leaks and the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with contacting more potential bidders
versus fewer, (iii) the potential for increased management distraction and (iv) the fact that certain parties had
already expressed an interest in the Company. Representatives of BofA Securities expressed their views that, if
the Board were to explore a potential sale, it would be beneficial to commence discussions with a targeted group
of both potential financial buyers as well as potential strategic buyers as the two types of bidders have different
strategic and market objectives that would help create competition in a sale process. In this context, the Board
discussed with the Company’s management and advisors the identities of parties which would likely be
interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company, including those that had already expressed an
interest in various types of transactions with the Company. Following discussions highlighting the benefits and
risks of assessing the Company’s valuation in a potential sale through the engagement with a targeted group of
potential buyers in a targeted market check, the Board directed members of Company management, together with
representatives of BofA Securities, to (i) begin conducting a targeted market check involving parties that had
previously expressed interest in the Company and certain additional strategic and financial parties and
(ii) facilitate such parties’ due diligence of the Company, subject to such parties entering into suitable
confidentiality agreements.
On August 3, 2022, after being contacted by representatives of BofA Securities, representatives of Parent
called Mr. Rice to inform Mr. Rice that Parent was considering imminently submitting a proposal to acquire the
Company, independent of the process being run by BofA Securities. Mr. Rice encouraged representatives of
Parent to participate in the process being run by BofA Securities.
During the beginning of August, at the request of the Board, representatives of BofA Securities contacted
five financial parties selected by the Board, including Party A, Party B, and the parties referred to herein as
“Party D”, “Party E”, “Party F”, and three strategic parties selected by the Board, including Parent and parties
referred to herein “Party G” and “Party H”, and provided draft confidentiality agreements prepared by Kirkland
to such parties. Two of the parties, Party F and Party H, informed BofA Securities that they did not wish to
participate in the potential sale process and did not execute a confidentiality agreement. Party C and one
additional financial party, referred to herein as “Party I”, expressed an unsolicited interest in participating in the
market check and were subsequently included in the process at the direction of the Board. Party C and Party I
were not included in the initial targeted list of potential buyers selected by the Board on August 2, 2022 as such
parties had not previously demonstrated any interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. BofA Securities
provided draft confidentiality agreements prepared by Kirkland to these two additional parties. The Company
ultimately entered into confidentiality agreements with seven parties, including Party A, Party B, Party C, Party
D, Party E, Party G and Parent. These
32
Table of Contents
confidentiality agreements contained customary “standstill” provisions that would automatically terminate upon
the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party. The Company and BofA
Securities also granted access to a virtual data room containing due diligence information relating to the
Company to each of the seven parties that entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company.
In August and early September, members of Company management held management presentations with
each of the seven parties that had executed a confidentiality agreement. From the beginning of August until the
execution of the merger agreement on October 16, 2022 (or, if earlier, the date on which a party engaged in the
potential sale process ceased to pursue a potential transaction), each of the potential buyer parties conducted
due diligence that included some combination of access to a virtual data room, receipt of a confidential
information memorandum, review of additional documentary materials, virtual and in-person diligence sessions
(including site visits) and other customary due diligence.
During the last two weeks of August and at the direction of the Board, an instruction letter requesting
initial non-binding indications of interest by September 1, 2022 with respect to a transaction was provided by
BofA Securities to the seven parties that had entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company by such
date.
On August 24, 2022 and at the request of Parent, Nick Stork, Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
member of the Board, and Mr. Rice met with representatives of Parent for dinner, during which they discussed
Parent’s operations and strategic rationale for a potential transaction. No financial or other material terms of any
potential transaction with the Company were discussed, and no post-closing employment or compensation with
respect to Mr. Stork or any other members of management were discussed.
On August 30, 2022, Parent delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding
proposal to acquire the Company for $24.00 in cash per share. In the letter, Parent indicated that its offer was
subject to completion of diligence and Republic delivering a waiver of certain of Republic’s rights under the joint
venture agreements relating to the Lightning Joint Venture prior to signing of any merger agreement. In addition,
Parent indicated that it expected that it would receive customary voting and support agreements signed by
principal insider stockholders of the Company.
On September 1, 2022, Party B delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding
proposal to acquire the Company for $23.75 in cash per share. In the letter, Party B indicated that its offer was
subject to completion of diligence. The letter did not include a requirement for Republic to deliver a waiver.
On September 2, 2022, Party C delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding
proposal to acquire the Company for $18.00 in cash per share. In the letter, Party C indicated that its offer was
subject to completion of diligence. The letter did not include a requirement for Republic to deliver a waiver.
On September 5, 2022, as instructed by the Company and in response to an inquiry from representatives of
Parent, representatives of BofA Securities notified the representatives of Morgan Stanley, Parent’s financial
advisor, that Parent will likely be advanced to participate in the second round of the process, subject to the
Board’s final determination, but encouraged Parent to improve their proposed price in order to be more
competitive.
On September 8, 2022, representatives of Party D informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party D
was no longer interested in a potential transaction and would cease to participate in the potential sale process.
On September 9, 2022, Party A delivered to BofA Securities a letter setting forth a preliminary, non-binding
proposal to acquire the Company for $22.50 in cash per share. In the letter, Party A indicated that its offer was
subject to completion of diligence and Republic delivering a waiver of certain of Republic’s rights under the joint
venture agreements relating to the Lightning Joint Venture prior to signing of any merger agreement.
On September 9, 2022, representatives of Party E informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party E
was no longer interested in a potential transaction and would cease to participate in the potential sale process.
On September 10, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of each of BofA Securities and Kirkland in attendance to review the preliminary proposals
received to date and discuss next steps in the process. At the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities
reviewed with the Board the
33
Table of Contents
status of the process, including the parties that had dropped out of consideration and the preliminary proposals
received from Parent, Party B, Party C and Party A. The presentation to the Board included considerations
relating to the fact that each of Parent and Party A requested that Republic deliver certain waivers under its joint
venture agreements relating to the Lightning Joint Venture. The Board considered a number of factors, including
(i) that Party A had missed the deadline for submission of preliminary proposals, (ii) that Party B had the highest
level of due diligence activity among the bidders, (iii) Company management’s and BofA Securities’ belief that
there was a low likelihood that Party G would be prepared to submit a definitive proposal on a timely basis,
(iv) Party C’s preliminary proposal of $18.00 in cash per share was significantly lower than the other preliminary
proposals, (v) Parent was the only strategic bidder to submit a preliminarily proposal and the potential benefits
of including another strategic bidder in the process and (vi) Party I has been unable to execute a confidentiality
agreement. Following these discussions and deliberations, the Board directed BofA Securities to terminate
discussions with Party C and Party I, solicit improved definitive proposals with respect to a transaction from
each of Parent, Party A and Party B and encourage Party G to submit a proposal with respect to a transaction in
order to generate additional interest from another strategic bidder.
Next, representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Board a summary of two draft merger agreements (one
for financial bidders, and another for strategic bidders) prepared by Kirkland that contemplated, among other
things, a “company termination fee” equal to 2.5% of the transaction equity value payable by the Company in
the event the merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances and customary “no shop”
provisions and a “hell or high water” regulatory commitment by the buyer to obtain the required regulatory
approvals to close the transaction. Following such review, the Board directed members of Company management
and Kirkland to finalize the draft merger agreement and BofA Securities to provide the draft merger agreement to
the bidders still participating in the process.
Following the meeting and over the following days, representatives of the Company and/or BofA
Securities contacted (i) representatives of each of Party C and Party I to inform such party that the Company was
terminating discussions with such party, (ii) representatives of each of Parent, Party A and Party B to encourage
such party to submit improved definitive proposals with respect to a transaction and increase its bid price,
noting that there was a small number of other bidders, that the range of bid prices was tight, and that each such
party should increase its bid price in order to be more competitive and (iii) representatives of Party G to
encourage such party to submit a proposal with respect to a transaction.
Over the course of August and September 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of BofA
Securities made available in the virtual data room incremental refinements and updates to the July Forecasts
prepared by the Company’s management at the direction of the Board in order to reflect more current information
and expectations regarding, among other things, (i) contracted portfolio assumptions, (ii) royalty payment
assumptions, (iii) certain joint venture project assumptions, (iv) amortization payment schedules for the
Company’s indebtedness and (v) completion of delivery dates for certain projects and end dates for certain gas
rights agreements. The final updated financial forecasts made available in the virtual data room on or around
September 14, 2022 (the “September Forecasts”) are described further in the section entitled “— Certain Financial
Projections”).
On September 15, 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of Kirkland provided two draft merger
agreements (one for financial bidders, and another for strategic bidders) to BofA Securities, which were
subsequently uploaded to the virtual data room and made available to each of Parent, Party A, Party B and Party
G.
On September 20, 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of BofA Securities delivered to Parent,
Party A, Party B and Party G an instruction letter requesting definitive proposals by October 5, 2022 and markups
of the draft merger agreement by September 28, 2022. As of the date of this proxy statement, no proposal was
submitted to the Company by Party G.
On September 21, 2022, Parent submitted an updated non-binding proposal letter to acquire the Company
at a price of $27.00 per share in cash, a mark-up of the draft merger agreement and a draft exclusivity agreement.
In the proposal letter, Parent expressed a desire to negotiate and ultimately announce a transaction before the
stated October 5th, 2022 bid deadline, requested exclusivity, and indicated that its proposal was subject to the
completion of diligence, Republic delivering the previously contemplated waiver and that certain principal insider
stockholders deliver customary voting and support agreements. The markup of the draft merger agreement
proposed, among other things, a company termination fee equal to 3.5% of the transaction equity value, and
provided that Parent would not
34
Table of Contents
be required to make any divestitures or commit to any conduct remedies to obtain regulatory approvals to close
the transaction, but would be willing to pay a reciprocal “reverse termination fee” of 3.5% of the transaction
equity value if certain specified regulatory-related closing conditions were not met.
On September 22, 2022, Mr. Rice and representatives of Parent had a call to discuss Parent’s updated
proposal, including the Company’s approach to regulatory matters, initial views on Parent’s request for a waiver
from Republic, Parent’s request for exclusivity, Parent’s proposed termination fees and Parent’s desired timing to
announce and consummate a potential transaction. Mr. Rice informed representatives of Parent that, because of
the many key open issues, it was unlikely the Board would agree to grant exclusivity at that time.
On September 23, 2022, Mr. Rice and representatives of Parent had a call to discuss strategy with respect
to approaching Republic with respect to a waiver of certain of their rights under the joint venture agreements
relating to the Lightning Joint Venture. On the same day, representatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP
(“Freshfields”), legal counsel to Parent, provided a draft of the Republic waiver to representatives of Kirkland.
On September 24 and September 25, 2022, Mr. Rice provided updates to the other directors with respect to,
and further discussed, Parent’s updated proposal. The Board was supportive of the Company and its advisors
negotiating the terms of the draft merger agreement with Parent and its advisors, and not engaging with Parent’s
request for exclusivity.
Also on September 24, representatives of Kirkland conveyed to representatives of Freshfields the
Company’s proposal on certain key issues in the merger agreement, including that Parent would be required to
use general reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals required to close the transaction (without an
express commitment with respect to divestitures and conduct remedies) and to pay a reverse termination fee of
15% of the transaction equity value if certain specified regulatory-related closing conditions were not met.
Kirkland also proposed a bifurcated company termination fee equal to (i) 0.50% of the transaction equity value in
the case of a competing transaction with a bidder who participated in the Company’s outreach process and
(ii) 2.75% of the transaction equity value in the case of an interloper who was not part of the Company’s
outreach process.
Later in the evening on September 24, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent to representatives of
Freshfields a revised draft of the merger agreement and Mr. Rice and representatives of Parent had a call to
discuss open issues relating to the merger agreement.
On September 25, 2022, at the request of Parent, Messrs. Stork and Rice met with representatives of Parent
for dinner, during which the parties discussed Parent’s strategic rationale for a potential transaction and the
Company’s business. No post-closing employment or compensation with respect to Mr. Stork or any other
members of management were discussed.
On September 27, 2022, representatives of Party B informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party B
was no longer interested in a potential transaction as a result of volatility in financing markets and its belief that
it would be unable to provide a higher offer price than the $23.75 per share price set forth in its preliminary, non-
binding proposal delivered on September 1, 2022, and Party B would cease to participate in the potential sale
process.
Also on the same day, representatives of Freshfields and Kirkland held various calls to discuss the merger
agreement. Over the course of the day, representatives of Freshfields provided to representatives of Kirkland a
proposal on certain open merger agreement issues and proposed processes for finalizing various related
documentation. Among other things, representatives of Freshfields, on behalf of Parent, proposed (i) a company
termination fee of 4.00% of the transaction equity value (regardless of whether an interloper had been part of the
Company’s process) and (ii) a reverse termination fee of 8.50% of the transaction equity value, provided that
Parent would have no obligations to make divestitures or commit to conduct remedies to secure regulatory
approvals for the transaction.
Later on the same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each
of Kirkland and BofA Securities present. During the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities provided the
Board with an update on the process, including that Party B had withdrawn from the process for the reasons
described
35
Table of Contents
above and that Party A would not be able to submit a revised proposal until October 7, 2022 due to the need for
additional time to obtain investment committee approval. The Board then reviewed the relationship disclosure
letter provided by BofA Securities. This letter detailed BofA Securities’ interests in and relationships with the
remaining bidders. Next, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board its updated preliminary
financial analysis based on the September Forecasts. The Company’s advisors also reviewed with the Board the
terms of Parent’s updated proposal, including Parent’s desire to negotiate and ultimately announce a transaction
before the stated October 5th, 2022 bid deadline, Parent’s request for a Republic waiver as a condition to signing
of the merger agreement and remaining key open issues relating to the draft merger agreement. The Board
considered with Company management and advisors whether to facilitate discussions between Parent and
Republic relating to the Republic waiver, taking into account (i) the fact that Party B had withdrawn from the
process, (ii) the fact that Party A had indicated it would be delayed in submitting a definitive proposal for the
reason stated above, (iii) the fact that Parent’s $27.00 per share offer price is meaningfully higher than the offer
price set forth in any other indication of interest delivered to date and (iv) the fact that Parent indicated a desire
to complete diligence and announce a transaction in the near future. Following these discussions and
deliberations, the Board instructed Company management and the Company’s advisors to continue engaging
with Parent and facilitate discussions between Parent and Republic relating to a waiver given the strength of
Parent’s bid.
In the evening on September 27, 2022, a representative of Parent had a call with Mr. Rice to discuss certain
of the key points in the merger agreement. Among other things, the parties discussed (i) a company termination
fee of 3.50% of the transaction equity value (regardless of whether an interloper had been part of the Company’s
process) and (ii) a reverse termination fee of 10.00% of the transaction equity value, provided that Parent would
have no obligations to make divestitures or commit to conduct remedies to secure regulatory approvals for the
transaction.
Early on September 28, 2022, representatives of Freshfields sent representatives of Kirkland a revised draft
of the merger agreement, providing for, among other things, the company termination fee and reverse termination
fee previously discussed by the Company and Parent.
Throughout the end of September 2022 until the signing of the merger agreement, the Company, with the
assistance of BofA Securities and Kirkland, continued discussions with Parent and its representatives and
advisors and discussed the proposed terms of the merger agreement and other transactions documents,
including, among other things, the interim operating covenants, treatment of equity awards and scope of the
representations and warranties.
On September 29, 2022 and consistent with the direction of the Board, Mr. Rice called a representative of
Republic to inform him that the Company was in discussions with Parent regarding a potential sale transaction
and the importance of Republic’s support of the potential sale transaction. Thereafter, representatives of Parent,
with the assistance of members of Company management and representatives of each of Freshfields, Kirkland
and BofA Securities, continued discussions with representatives of Republic in relation to the terms between
Parent and Republic for the Republic waiver and the documentation thereof.
On October 3, 2022, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each of
Kirkland and BofA Securities present. During the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities noted that Party A
remained engaged and was continuing its diligence. Representatives of Kirkland and members of Company
management provided the Board with an update on negotiations of the draft merger agreement and the status of
discussions relating to the Republic waiver. Additionally, the Board discussed a request by Parent to begin
negotiating voting agreements between Parent and certain stockholders of the Company to support the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. After discussion of the expected terms of such voting
agreement, the Board directed Kirkland to inform Parent and its legal advisors that Parent and its legal advisors
had the Board’s approval to begin negotiations of such voting agreements with the applicable stockholders.
Between October 4, 2022, and signing of the merger agreement, representatives of Kirkland, Freshfields
and the stockholders to be party to the Voting Agreement exchanged drafts of the voting agreement and other
related transaction documents (including drafts of the Warrant Agreement Amendment, Opco LLC Agreement
Amendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter and spoke by telephone and corresponded
by email to discuss those drafts.

On October 5, 2022, the Company received an unsolicited non-binding expression of interest from a
financial party, referred to herein as “Party J”, to acquire the Company at a price of $23.50 to $28.50 per share in
cash. The letter stated that its proposal was subject to confirmatory diligence, and that Party J could complete its
due diligence in six weeks.
On the same day, as instructed by the Board, a representative of BofA contacted a representative of Parent
to urge Parent to expedite progress on obtaining the waiver from Republic and finalizing the definitive
documentation for the merger and indicated that the price in Parent’s most recent proposal may still need to be
increased for Parent to prevail.
On October 6, 2022, representatives of counsel to Party A contacted Mr. Rice and representatives of
Kirkland to inform Mr. Rice and Kirkland that Party A would be providing a markup of the merger agreement later
the same day or the following day.
Later on the same day, representatives of Freshfields separately called representatives of each of Jones
Day, management’s separate counsel, and Kirkland to convey Parent’s requirement that each of Mr. Stork,
Richard Walton and Brian McCarthy would execute employment offer letters with Parent concurrently with
signing of the merger agreement.
On October 7, 2022, representatives of Party A submitted to representatives of BofA Securities a definitive
proposal for $19.50 per share, along with markup of merger agreement. On the same day, representatives of
Parent and representatives of the Company discussed several issues relating to the merger agreement, including
with respect to interim operating covenants.
Later on October 7, 2022, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of
each of Kirkland and BofA Securities present to review Party A’s definitive proposal and Party J’s preliminary
expression of interest and to discuss considerations relating to Parent’s request to discuss employment offer
letters with members of Company management. First, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board
Party A’s definitive proposal to acquire the Company for $19.50 per share in cash, expressing its views that Party
A, as a financial buyer, is unlikely to be able to significantly increase its offer price given conditions in the
financing markets. Representatives of BofA Securities also reviewed with the Board Party J’s preliminary non-
binding expression of interest, noting that Party J indicated that it would require six weeks to complete its due
diligence and that Party J has not yet been provided any non-public due diligence information. The Board also
discussed and considered with Company management and its advisors the likelihood that any definitive offer by
Party J following completion of due diligence would be meaningfully differentiated from the offers provided by
the other financial parties, Party A and Party B, given that Party J likely faced the same financing concerns
expressed by such other financial parties. Next, members of Company management provided an update on
discussions between Parent and Republic relating to the Republic waiver, noting that discussions were ongoing.
Lastly, representatives of Kirkland recounted Parent’s request for employment discussions with certain members
of Company management and Parent’s requirement that certain members of Company management execute
employment offer letters concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement. Following these discussions
and deliberations, the Board determined that Company management and advisors should (i) contact Party J to
determine its ability to complete its diligence and announce a potential transaction on an expedited basis,
(ii) continue negotiating the terms of the draft merger agreement with representatives of Parent and its advisors
and (iii) encourage Parent to finalize the waiver with Republic. The Board determined that it would meet to further
discuss Parent’s request to discuss employment offer letters with Company management at a later date after
Republic and Parent reach agreement as to the terms of a Republic waiver and directed Company management
not to engage in any discussions relating to future employment with Parent until authorized by the Board.
On October 8, 2022, as instructed by the Board, representatives of BofA Securities contacted
representatives of Party J to determine its ability to complete its diligence and announce a transaction on an
accelerated basis. The parties discussed considerations relating to Party J’s expected due diligence timeline, and
representatives of Party J informed representatives of BofA Securities that Party J would require at least
four weeks to announce a transaction.
On October 11, 2022, representatives of Parent contacted Mr. Rice to convey that Parent was lowering its
offer to $25.00 per share in cash based on variances in Parent’s modeled cost structure for the Company relative
to Parent’s findings during due diligence on the Company.

Later on the same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each
of Kirkland and BofA Securities present to discuss the status of Republic discussions and next steps relating to
Parent’s revised proposal on deal price. Members of Company management reported to the Board that
representatives of Republic had indicated that Republic would support a transaction with Parent and the
documentation for Parent’s requested waiver was being finalized between Republic and Parent. Representatives
of BofA Securities also recounted to the Board their discussions with representatives of Party J held on
October 8, 2022 and described above. Next, the Board considered with Company management and advisors
potential responses to Parent lowering the per share value of its bid. The Board considered with Company
management and advisors (i) whether Parent’s rationale for the decrease was compelling and (ii) the
effectiveness of a range of potential responses to Parent, including rejecting the lowered amount and terminating
discussions with Parent, engaging with Parent to negotiate their new price upwards and accepting the lowered
amount. In considering the response to Parent with respect to the revised price, the Board discussed the
advanced state of negotiations and documentation with Parent, the uncertainty around the price offered by other
competing bidders, the significant work still necessary for other competing bidders to be ready to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a transaction and the fact that engaging Republic with other bidders would
create additional process challenges. Following these discussions and deliberations, the Board directed Mr. Rice
to explore with Parent the potential for Parent to increase its price above $25.00 per share.
On October 12, 2022, Mr. Rice contacted a representative of Parent to convey that a price above $25.00 per
share would be necessary for the Board to consider a potential transaction and encouraged representatives of
Parent to increase Parent’s offer price to a price of $26.00 per share. The representative of Parent indicated that
Parent would consider whether Parent could meet the requested increase to $26.00 per share.
On October 13, 2022, representatives of Parent contacted Mr. Rice to indicate that, provided that the terms
of the merger agreement would largely reflect the most recently conveyed positions of Parent, Parent would be
willing to agree to a purchase price of $26.00 per share. Mr. Rice agreed to communicate Parent’s $26.00 per share
position to the Board and pending such Board discussion, discuss further with Parent.
Later on the same day, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of each
of Kirkland and BofA Securities in attendance. Mr. Rice provided the Board with an update on process and price.
The Board discussed with Company management and advisors that relative to the other competing bids and
based on the analysis provided by BofA Securities, the revised offer from Parent was the most attractive
alternative, and the Board determined that the Company should move forward with Parent’s increased offer of
$26.00 per share in cash. Representatives of Kirkland then reviewed with the Board the key terms of the draft
merger agreement. Having decided to proceed with the revised price from Parent, the Board discussed whether it
was then the appropriate time to authorize certain members of Company management to engage with Parent’s
requirement that such members of management execute employment offer letters concurrently with the execution
of the merger agreement. After discussion with such members of management, including with respect to the use
of management’s separate counsel at Jones Day to negotiate such arrangements on management’s behalf and
management’s comfort with the negotiation timeline, the Board authorized management to engage with Parent
and negotiate and finalize the terms of their employment offer letters with Parent.
On October 13, 2022, with the authorization of the Board, Mr. Stork had dinner with representatives of
Parent. During the dinner, the parties discussed how the Company would fit operationally in Parent’s structure,
assuming agreement with respect to a transaction were to be reached.
On October 14, 2022, representatives of Parent contacted each of Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy to
discuss the proposed employment offers and to verbally convey Parent’s compensation proposal.
Between October 14, 2022 and October 16, 2022, representatives of each of Parent and management,
including management’s counsel at Jones Day, exchanged drafts of employment offer letters, had several phone
calls and corresponded by email to discuss those drafts.
During the evening of October 16, 2022, representatives of each of Parent and Company management
finalized the key terms of the employment offer letters. The Board then met with members of Company
management and representatives of each of BofA Securities and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of
Kirkland reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. Mr. Rice confirmed to the Board that the Republic
waiver and the key terms of the employment offer letters, which were customary and typical, were in final form.
Representatives of Kirkland then provided the Board with an update on the terms of the draft merger agreement.
The Board then

reviewed the relationship disclosure letter provided by BofA Securities and concluded that none of information
provided by BofA Securities would impact the ability of BofA Securities to act as financial advisor to the
Company. At the request of the Board, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with the Board its financial
analysis of the merger consideration and delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of October 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of the
written opinion and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the
merger consideration to be received by holders of Company Class A Common Stock (other than Owned
Company Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following further discussion of
potential factors in favor of and against the potential transaction, the Board unanimously (i) determined that it
was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger
Agreement and consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreement, the Warrant Agreement Amendment, the Opco LLC Agreement
Amendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of
the merger agreement by the Company and OpCo, the performance by the Company and OpCo of their
covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions upon
the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Voting Agreement, the Warrant Agreement Amendment, the
Opco LLC Agreement Amendment and the Unitholder Representative Engagement Letter; (iii) determined that
the Voting Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders and approved the Voting Agreement and Warrant Agreement Amendment so that
the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar laws are not
applicable to the merger agreement; (iv) approved the Opco LLC Agreement Amendment and the Unitholder
Representative Engagement Letter; (v) resolved to recommend that the Company stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (vi) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be
submitted for consideration by the Company stockholders at a meeting thereof and approved the inclusion of
the board recommendation in this Proxy Statement.
Later that evening, Republic, the Company and Parent executed and delivered the documentation
providing for the waiver of Republic’s change in control rights that would have otherwise been triggered by the
closing of the Merger Agreement with Parent. Thereafter, the parties executed the Merger Agreement, Voting
Agreement, Conditional Offer Letters and other transaction documents.
Early on October 17, 2022, Parent and the Company each issued press releases announcing the
transaction.

vote “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
39Table of Contents
In reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that the Company’s
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board considered the following positive reasons to support the
Merger Agreement:
•
        
the fact that the price of $26.00 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate
value and liquidity to the Company’s stockholders;
•
        
the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Class A
common stock, including the fact that the $26.00 per share to be received by the Company’s
stockholders in the Merger represents:
•
        
a premium of approximately 54% over the closing price per share of Class A common stock as
of October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger;
•
        
a premium of approximately 38% over the volume weighted average price per share of Class A
common stock for the 30 trading days ending October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to
the announcement of the Merger;
•
        
a premium of approximately 40% over the volume weighted average price per share of Class A
common stock for the 60 trading days ending October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to
the announcement of the Merger; and
•
        
a premium of approximately 47% over the volume weighted average price per share of Class A
common stock for the 90 trading days ending October 14, 2022, the last full trading day prior to
the announcement of the Merger.
•
        
the belief that the $26.00 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to the
Company’s stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from
other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, based upon the directors’ extensive
knowledge of the Company’s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, the
challenges to raising development financing in the current macro-economic market, the Company’s
historical and projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger
represented an attractive and comparatively certain value for the Company’s stockholders relative to
the risk-adjusted prospects for the Company on a standalone basis;
•
        
the belief that the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing the Company’s
stockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the Merger (including scenarios
involving the possibility of remaining a standalone publicly traded company and other strategic
alternatives that might be pursued as a standalone public company) were less favorable to the
Company’s stockholders, taking into account the timing, risks and likelihood of accomplishing such
alternatives, and further taking into account the Board’s belief that there were likely no other
potential purchasers that would be reasonably likely to engage in a transaction in the near term at a
price greater than the price being offered by Parent;
•
        
the current and prospective business, financial condition, results of operations, strategic options
and prospects, the risks and challenges associated with (including the need for additional financing),
and the likely effect of these factors on the Company and the execution of the Company’s plans as a
standalone public company;
•
        
the process conducted by the Company, with the assistance of its advisors, to review other potential
strategic alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with numerous counterparties
regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company;
•
        
the fact that certain stockholders of the Company, collectively holding approximately 27% of the
outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, and who will receive
the same consideration as the Company’s other stockholders, are supportive of the Transactions and
were willing to execute a voting agreement in support of the Transactions;

•
        
the business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of Parent, and its strong track record
of involvement with capital intensive projects in the energy industry, including with respect to
renewable energy projects and the Board’s view that a combination with Parent will enable the
business to realize its full potential, given that Parent is a world class partner with operational history
in the RNG value chain;
•
        
that the merger consideration to be paid by Parent was the result of arms’-length negotiations
between the parties and their respective advisors and followed a competitive bid process, which
included a price increase of (i) $2.00 per share from the $24.00 per share included in the non-binding
indication of interest submitted by Parent on August 30, 2022 and (ii) $1.00 per share from the $25.00
per share communicated by Parent on October 11, 2022, and the Board’s belief, after concluding the
competitive bid process and extensive discussions with Parent, that the merger consideration of
$26.00 per share represented the best price reasonably available for the Company and which Parent
was willing to pay;
•
        
the fact that the Board conducted a competitive, multi-round process, involving 11 potential buyers,
bringing seven under confidentiality agreements, and ultimately receiving five indications of
interest;
•
        
the belief that, if the Company did not enter into the Merger Agreement with Parent, there could be a
considerable period of time before the trading price per share of the Company’s Class A common
stock would reach and sustain the per share merger consideration of $26.00, as adjusted for present
value (even assuming full realization of the management projections);
•
        
the oral opinion of BofA Securities, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated October 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of October 16, 2022, and based upon and
subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the per share consideration of
$26.00 to be received by holders of Class A common stock (other than Owned Company Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more
fully described under the section of this proxy statement titled “— Opinion of Company’s Financial
Advisor,” which full text of the written opinion of BofA Securities is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
•
        
the high degree of certainty that the Merger would close in a timely manner in light of the conditions
and other terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and the requirement that the parties use their
respective reasonable best efforts to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement) to
obtain all necessary governmental approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable;
•
        
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and
scope, and which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of the Company’s
representations and warranties, is generally subject to a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement — Representations and
Warranties”) qualification;
•
        
the fact that the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect has a number of customary
exceptions and is generally a very high standard applied by courts;
•
        
the ability of the Board to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in
certain circumstances, and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal upon
payment of a termination fee of $114.5 million (which the Board believed was reasonable under the
circumstances);
•
        
the termination fee of $327.2 million that may be owed by Parent to the Company in connection with
the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified regulatory related circumstances (which
the Board believed was reasonable under the circumstances);
•
        
the end date of July 16, 2023 (subject to extension under certain circumstances), which is expected to
allow for sufficient time to complete the Merger;
•
        
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to the Company’s stockholders who do not vote in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and otherwise comply with all required procedures under
the DGCL;

•
        
the fact that the Merger Agreement was approved by the Board, which is comprised of a majority of
independent directors who are not employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and which
received advice from the Company’s outside financial and legal advisors in evaluating, negotiating
and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
        
the fact that the consideration and negotiation of the Merger Agreement was conducted through
extensive arm’s-length negotiations;
•
        
the fact that the Merger is not subject to a financing condition and that the Parent Entities have
represented that the Parent Entities will, as of the closing of the Merger, have available sufficient
funds sufficient to pay the amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement;

the Company’s rights to specific performance under the terms of the Merger Agreement; and
•
        
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, in light of the experience, reputation and
financial capabilities of Parent.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered, among other things, the following potentially
negative factors:
•
        
the fact that the Company’s stockholders will not participate in any future growth potential or benefit
from any future increase in the value of the Company as a subsidiary of Parent following completion
of the Merger;
•
        
the possibility that all conditions to the Merger will not be timely satisfied or waived and that the
Merger will not be consummated, and the potential negative effects on the Company’s business,
operations, financial results and stock price;
•
        
the potential negative effects of the public announcement of the Merger on the Company’s sales,
operating results and stock price, its ability to retain key management and other personnel, and its
relationships with customers, suppliers and partners;
•
        
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger,
requiring the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course and preventing the Company
from taking certain specified actions, subject to specific limitations;
•

Officers in the Merger.”
The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not, and is not
intended to be, exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the
Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise attempt to rank or assign relative weights to the various factors considered in reaching their respective
determinations. In considering the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of the
Board may have viewed factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration to different factors. In
addition, the Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or
any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board, but
rather the Board conducted an overall review of the factors described above, including discussions with
Company management and legal and financial advisors.
The foregoing discussion of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the
section of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

The Company has retained BofA Securities to act as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with
the Merger. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged
in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. The Company selected BofA Securities to act as the Company’s financial advisor
in connection with the Merger on the basis of BofA Securities’ experience in transactions similar to the Merger,
its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with the Company and its business.
On October 16, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the Merger, BofA Securities delivered to
the Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 16, 2022, to the
effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations
described in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Class A common stock (other
than Owned Company Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the Board, which describes, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is
attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following
summary of BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA
Securities delivered its opinion to the Board for the benefit and use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view.
BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed
as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to
the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company
to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the
proposed Merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities has, among other things:
(i)
     
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company;
(ii)
    
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of the Company furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of
the Company, including certain financial forecasts relating to the Company prepared by the
management of the Company (such forecasts, the “Company Forecasts”);
(iii)
   
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company with members of senior management of the Company;
43Table of Contents
(iv)
   
reviewed the trading history for Class A common stock and a comparison of that trading history with
the trading histories of other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(v)
    
compared certain financial and stock market information of the Company with similar information of
other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(vi)
   
considered the results of BofA Securities’ efforts on behalf of the Company to solicit, at the direction
of the Company, indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a
possible acquisition of the Company;
(vii)  reviewed a draft, dated October 16, 2022, of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
(viii) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as
BofA Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and BofA Securities relied upon the assurances of the
management of the Company that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Company Forecasts,
BofA Securities was advised by the Company, and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of the Company as
to the future financial performance of the Company. BofA Securities did not make and was not provided with any
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor did
it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. BofA Securities did not evaluate the
solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of the Company, that the
Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory
and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition,
including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an
adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. BofA Securities also assumed, at the
direction of the Company, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from
the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the
Merger (other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Securities’ opinion
was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders
of Class A common stock (other than Owned Company Shares) and no opinion or view was expressed with
respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the
fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the
officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the
Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the
Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the
Merger. BofA Securities did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and relied, with the Company’s
consent, upon the assessments of the Company and its representatives regarding legal, regulatory, accounting,
tax and similar matters relating to the Company or the Merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof), as to
which matters BofA Securities understood that the Company had obtained such advice as the Company deemed
necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as
to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter. Except as
described in this summary, the Company imposed no other limitations on the investigations made or procedures
followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.

Table of Contents
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other
conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of, the
date of its opinion. BofA Securities noted that the credit, financial and stock markets had been experiencing
unusual volatility and BofA Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility
on the Company, Parent or the Merger. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance
of BofA Securities’ opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities.
The discussion set forth below in the section entitled “— Archaea Financial Analyses” represents a brief
summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board in connection with its
opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.
Archaea Financial Analyses
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.
    
BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and
stock market information for the Company and Ameresco, Inc. (“Ameresco”), a publicly traded company in the
renewable natural gas industry. In BofA Securities’ view, based on its professional judgment and experience,
Ameresco was the publicly traded company with business, regulatory and cash flow characteristics most similar
to those of the Company. BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise value of Ameresco,
calculated as its market value based on its closing stock price on October 14, 2022 and the number of its diluted
shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, plus debt, preferred stock, non-controlling interests and
less cash and cash equivalents, short-term liquid investments and long-term liquid investments, as a multiple of
calendar year 2023 and 2024 EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Certain
Financial Projections”), as set forth in the table below. Estimated financial data of Ameresco was based on
publicly available research analysts’ estimates.
 
Enterprise Value/Estimated EBITDA
 
 
2023E
 
2024E
Ameresco, Inc.

Based on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a range of calendar year 2023
and 2024 EBITDA multiples of 11.2x to 17.4x and 8.3x to 14.3x, respectively, derived from Ameresco and the
Company’s trading history, to the Company’s calendar year 2023 and 2024 EBITDA of $285 million and
$346 million, respectively, as set forth in the Company Forecasts, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values
for the Company.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share value reference ranges for the
Company, as compared to the Merger Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for the Company

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the public trading or other values of any company to which the Company was compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
    
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the
Company to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone Unlevered Free Cash Flows (as defined in
the section of this proxy statement titled “— Certain Financial Projections”) that the Company was forecasted to
generate during the Company’s calendar years 2023 through 2032 based on the September Forecasts (as defined
in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Certain Financial Projections”). BofA Securities calculated
45
Table of Contents
terminal values for the Company by applying a perpetuity growth rate of 4.0% to 5.0%, based on BofA Securities’
professional judgement and experience, to the Company’s projected standalone Unlevered Free Cash Flows in
the terminal year of $632 million, which was obtained by extrapolating the Company’s 2032 projected standalone
Unlevered Free Cash Flows of $833 million at an assumed growth rate of 4.5%, as provided by the management
of the Company. BofA Securities subtracted, from the range of terminal values, net debt of $624 million as of
October 7, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company. The cash flows and terminal values were then
discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 13.25%, which
were based on an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by
multiplying the estimated cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding
the products together. The estimated cost of equity was obtained using the capital asset pricing model (which
takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity market risk premium) and the
estimated cost of debt was based on the Company’s estimated borrowing cost. The number of fully-diluted
shares outstanding was 125.9 million as of October 13, 2022, based on information provided by the management
of the Company. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference
ranges for the Company as compared to the Merger Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range for the Company

Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’
material financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including,
among other things, the following:
•
        
historical trading prices and trading volumes of the Class A common stock, which indicated low and
high closing prices for Class A common stock during the 52-week period ended October 14, 2022 of
approximately $13.12 to $23.75 per share;
•
        
price targets for the Class A common stock in publicly available research analyst reports, which
indicated stock price targets for the Company of a range of approximately $25.00 to $35.00 per share;
•
        
estimated net asset value per share of Class A common stock, provided by the management of the
Company, of approximately $18.21 to $27.59 per share; and
•
        
a take-private analysis provided for illustrative purposes to determine an implied price per share of
Class A common stock that could hypothetically be paid by a private buyer based on certain
assumptions, including, among others (i) a target levered internal rate of return, referred to as IRR,
for the private buyer of 13.0% to 17.0%, (ii) a $300 million term loan (exclusive of existing net debt)
due on December 31, 2032, which will be refinanced at 3.0x leverage on December 31, 2029 then
retired on December 31, 2032, is used to fund some of the purchase, (iii) an exit on December 31, 2032
at a multiple of the Company’s latest 12 months EBITDA of 8.0x, (iv) a promote of 5% for employee
compensation and (v) 2% transaction fees and expenses paid on entry and exit. This analysis
indicated an implied per share equity value for the Company of a range of approximately $17.38 to
$31.91.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “— Archaea Financial Analyses”
represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board in
connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or the factors
considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion
is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses
summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its
analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering
all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of the
46
Table of Contents
processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been
referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any
other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and
economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates of
the future performance of the Company in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates
or those suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA
Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were provided
to the Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities
have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of
valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual values of the Company.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations
between the Company and Parent, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The
decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. As described above, BofA Securities’
opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the proposed
Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or the Company’s management with
respect to the Merger or the Merger Consideration.
The Company has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an
aggregate fee of approximately $29.0 million, $2.5 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion
and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, at the sole
discretion of the Company, a discretionary fee of approximately $4.1 million may be payable to BofA Securities.
The Company also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA
Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in
securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal
investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,
financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of
companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its
affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold
long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of (i) the Company and
certain of its affiliates, and (ii) Parent and certain of its affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may
provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to the Company and have received
or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting
as a lender under a credit facility of an affiliate of the Company and (ii) having acted as a co-manager to the
Company on an equity follow-on offering. From October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2022, BofA Securities and
its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from the Company and certain of its affiliates of approximately
$1.2 million for investment and corporate banking services.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the
future may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Parent and have
received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted
or acting as a financial advisor to an affiliate of Parent in an acquisition and in a sale of a minority stake in a
pipeline, (ii) having acted or acting as an active bookrunner in a bond offering, (iii) having acted or acting as
administrative agent, co-lead arranger, joint bookrunner for, and a lender under, certain credit facilities of Parent
or certain of its affiliates, (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury services and products to Parent and
certain of its affiliates, and (v) having provided or providing certain commodity, derivatives and foreign exchange
trading services

The Company does not, as a matter of general practice, prepare or publicly disclose long-range financial
forecasts due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future
periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. However, in
connection with the Board’s evaluation of strategic alternatives, in July 2022, the Company, at the request of the
Board, provided to the Board and BofA Securities with certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial
information prepared by Company management for the fiscal years ending 2023 through 2032 reflecting what the
Company’s management believed were the best then-available estimates and judgments of future financial
performance of the Company for such periods (the “July Forecasts”). The July Forecasts were reviewed by the
Board on July 24, 2022. In addition, at the request of the Board, a version of the July Forecasts with minor
updates by Company management to reflect more current information and expectations regarding federal income
tax assumptions was made available in August 2022 to Parent and certain other parties in connection with their
due diligence of a possible transaction with the Company. On and after September 14, 2022, the Company, at the
request of the Board, provided the Board, BofA Securities, Parent and certain other parties in connection with
their due diligence of a possible transaction, as applicable, with updated, non-public, unaudited prospective
financial information prepared for the fiscal years ending 2023 through 2032 in order to reflect more current
information and expectations regarding, among other things, (i) contracted portfolio assumptions, (ii) royalty
payment assumptions, (iii) certain joint venture project assumptions, (iv) amortization payment schedules for the
Company’s indebtedness and (v) completion of delivery dates for certain projects and end dates for certain gas
rights agreements. This updated prospective financial information (the “September Forecasts”) was also
provided to (a) BofA Securities for its use and reliance as the basis for the financial valuation analyses
conducted by BofA Securities and opinion summarized in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Opinion
of the Company’s Financial Advisor” and (b) the Board in its review of, and in connection with approving, the
Merger Agreement and the Merger.
The July Forecasts and the September Forecasts (together, the “Forecasts”) were prepared by Company
management at the direction of the Company Board. The Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public
disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC or established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the
Forecasts, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its
achievability.
The tables below present summaries of the Forecasts, as prepared by Company management and provided
by Company management to the Board, BofA Securities, Parent and/or certain other parties in connection with
the proposed Merger, as applicable. The Forecasts summarized below are included solely to provide the
Company’s stockholders access to financial projections that were made available to the Company, BofA
Securities, Parent and/or certain other parties in connection with the proposed Merger, as applicable, and are not
included in this proxy statement to influence a Company stockholder’s decision whether to vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.
The Forecasts summarized below, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future
economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control. The Forecasts also reflect assumptions that are
subject to change, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding: future industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, litigation, market and financial conditions, and matters specific to the Company’s
business. The Forecasts cover multiple years, and thus, by their nature, they become subject to greater
uncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of
the Forecasts include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt,
capital, credit or securities markets; industry and market dynamics; competition; and those risks and
uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2021 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. See also the section
titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this proxy statement.
48Table of Contents
In addition, the Forecasts reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple
interpretations based on actual results, revised prospects for the Company’s business, changes in general
business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that
was not anticipated when the Forecasts were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ
materially, from those contained in the Forecasts. The Forecasts assume organic company growth, inclusive of
the development of existing joint development project pipelines without business expansions from mergers and
acquisitions. The Forecasts also include assumptions regarding future landfill expansion and existing INGENCO
and Lightning Joint Venture projects, assumptions regarding future opportunities through the Lightning Joint
Venture with no current developers and assumptions regarding future gas rights agreements expected to be
completed, but not yet agreed. The Forecasts do not include potential earnings relating to hydrogen, CO2, heat
and LFG collection efficiency improvements. In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any
circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the Forecasts were prepared and do not
give effect to any changes or expenses incurred after the date on which they were made, including as a result of
the Merger or any effects of the Merger. The Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the
Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Forecasts were prepared or to reflect the
occurrence of future events, even if any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. There can
be no assurance that the financial results in the Forecasts will be realized, or that future actual financial results
will not materially vary from those estimated in the Forecasts.
Certain of the measures included in the Forecasts are financial measures that are not calculated in
accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP
financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and
credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial measures
should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC’s rules concerning non-
GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP
financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP
financial measure, in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the
disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial
measures were not prepared or relied upon by the Company Board in connection with its consideration of the
Merger Agreement or by BofA Securities for purposes of its financial analyses. Accordingly, the Company has
not provided a reconciliation of any financial measures included in the Forecasts.

Certain Effects of the Merger",56,58
Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Certain Effects of the Merger,"Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Merger Proposal is approved and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either
satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Archaea upon the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement. As the surviving corporation in the Merger, Archaea will continue to exist following the Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Following the Merger, all of the Archaea common stock will be beneficially owned by Parent and none of
the Company’s current stockholders will have any direct ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the consummation of the Merger. As a result, the Company’s
current stockholders will no longer have the potential to benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear
the risk of any decrease in the value, of Archaea common stock. Following the Merger, Parent will have the
potential to benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in the
Company’s value.
At the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class A common
stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Owned
Company Shares or any Dissenting Company Shares), will be automatically canceled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Also, at the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, each share of Class B
common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. Each holder of Class B
common stock also holds an equivalent number of Opco Units.
Also, at the Effective Time, and without any action by any Archaea stockholder, (i) each share of common
stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically canceled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) each of the Owned Company Shares will automatically be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.
At the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, each Opco Unit
held by a holder other than the Specified Opco Holders issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Opco Merger Effective Time will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Also, at the Opco Merger Effective Time, and without any action by any holder of Opco Units, (i) the
Owned Opco Units shall become an equivalent number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving
Opco held by the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) all limited liability company interests of Opco Merger Sub will
automatically be canceled, extinguished and converted into limited liability company interests of the Surviving
Opco, such that
50Table of Contents
the aggregate number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco to be held by Parent
immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time will represent the same percentage of the outstanding
limited liability company interests of the Surviving Opco immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time
as the percentage of Opco Units held by the Specified Opco Holders immediately prior to the Opco Merger
Effective Time. As a result, immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, based on the number of Opco
Units issued and outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement, approximately 30.9% of the limited liability
company interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by Parent, and approximately 69.1% of the limited
liability company interests in the Surviving Opco will be held directly by the Company (and accordingly
indirectly by Parent).
Immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each of the Warrants will be redeemed for cash in
accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, which provides
that immediately following the Opco Merger Effective Time, each Warrant that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically redeemed for the right to receive an amount, in cash,
equal to (i) the Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement and
which is currently $11.50) as reduced pursuant to the calculation provided in Section 4.4 of the Warrant
Agreement, without interest.
At the Effective Time, all Archaea equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will generally be afforded the treatment described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards in the Merger.”
Class A common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol “LFG.” Following the consummation of the Merger, shares of Class A common stock will be
delisted from the NYSE. In addition, the registration of shares of Class A common stock under the Exchange Act
will be terminated, and the Company will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC
with respect to its Class A common stock. Termination of registration of Class A common stock under the
Exchange Act will make provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual and quarterly
reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with
stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to the Company.
Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed",58,59
Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed,"Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed
for any other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Archaea
common stock or Opco Units in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent
public company, the Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE, the Class A
common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, the Company will continue to file periodic
and other reports with the SEC with respect to its Class A common stock, and the Company’s stockholders will
continue to own their shares of Archaea common stock and the members of Opco will continue to own their
Opco Units and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with
respect to ownership of Archaea common stock and Opco Units, respectively.
If the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your shares of Archaea common stock, including the risk that the market price of the Class A
common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of the Class A common stock reflects a
market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance that
any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial
condition, earnings or prospects of the Company will not be adversely affected. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, under certain circumstances, the Company is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement in order
to enter into an alternative transaction and may be obligated to pay to Parent a termination fee. See the section of
this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement — Termination.”
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",59,59
Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,"Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
Details of the beneficial ownership of Archaea common stock by the Company’s directors and executive
officers are set forth in the section of this proxy statement titled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management.” In addition to their interests in the Merger as stockholders, the Company’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
the Company’s
51Table of Contents
stockholders generally. In considering the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting, you should be aware
of these interests. Members of the Archaea Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the
determination to approve the Merger Agreement and to declare that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, and in recommending that the holders of Archaea common stock vote for
adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
        
the relevant price per share of Archaea common stock is $26.00 (the “per share price”);
•
        
each non-employee director and executive officer holds the outstanding equity awards that were
held by each non-employee director and such executive officer as of October 28, 2022, the latest
practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement; and
•
        
the amounts set forth below regarding executive officer compensation are based on compensation
levels as of October 28, 2022.
Archaea’s current executive officers are:
•
        
Nicholas Stork, our Chief Executive Officer;
•
        
Richard Walton, our President;
•
        
Brian McCarthy, our Chief Financial Officer;
•
        
Edward Taibi, our General Counsel and EVP of Strategic Initiatives and Government Affairs; and
•
        
Chad Bellah, our Chief Accounting Officer.
The disclosure below does not include Eric Javidi or Lindsay Ellis, who were executive officers of the
Company prior to their resignations. Mr. Javidi resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Ms. Ellis
resigned as General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, each effective as of March 1, 2022, and neither is
eligible to receive any payments or benefits in connection with the Merger.
Archaea’s current non-employee directors are:
•
        
J. Kyle Derham;
•
        
Kathryn Jackson;
•

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
For additional information regarding beneficial ownership of Archaea common stock by each of Archaea’s
directors and named executive officers and beneficial ownership of Archaea common stock by all directors and
executive officers as a group, see the section of this proxy statement titled “Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management.” Each of Archaea’s non-employee directors and executive officers will be
entitled to receive, for each share of Archaea common stock, Opco Unit or Warrant he or she holds as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the same Merger Consideration in cash in the same manner as other
holders of Archaea common stock, Opco Units or Warrants, respectively.
52
Table of Contents
Each of Archaea’s non-employee directors hold RSUs (as defined below). Archaea’s executive officers
hold RSUs and PSUs (as defined below) that will be afforded the treatment described below. Archaea’s non-
employee directors do not hold any outstanding PSUs.
Under the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”), we have granted service-based
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to our employees and
executive officers to incentivize and reward them for our long-term corporate performance based on the value of
Class A common stock. Each of our non-employee directors are granted RSUs under the Omnibus Plan in
accordance with the terms of our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy (the “Director Compensation
Policy”).
At the Effective Time, all Archaea equity awards, including awards held by our non-employee directors
and executive officers, that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will generally be subject to
the following treatment:
•
        
Each vested RSU and vested PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(“Vested RSU” and “Vested PSU,” respectively), each RSU that is held by a non-employee director of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Director RSU”) and, with respect to unvested
RSUs and unvested PSUs that are not Director RSUs, 50% of each holder’s unvested RSUs and 50%
of each holder’s unvested PSUs that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(“Deemed Vested RSUs” and “Deemed Vested PSUs,” respectively) will, at the Effective Time, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Class A
common stock subject to such Vested RSU, Vested PSU, Director RSU, Deemed Vested RSU and
Deemed Vested PSU, respectively, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with performance
vesting conditions for Deemed Vested PSUs being deemed achieved at maximum levels of
performance) and (ii) $26.00.
•
        
Each RSU and each PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a
Vested RSU, Director RSU or Deemed Vested RSU (an “Unvested RSU”) or a Vested PSU or Deemed
Vested PSU (an “Unvested PSU”), respectively, will, at the Effective Time, be canceled and converted
into an award representing the contingent right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Class A common stock subject to such Unvested RSU or Unvested PSU, respectively, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with performance vesting conditions for Unvested PSUs
being deemed achieved at maximum levels of performance) (a “Deferred Cash RSU Award” or
“Deferred Cash PSU Award,” respectively) and (ii) $26.00. Each Deferred Cash RSU Award or
Deferred Cash PSU Award will, subject to the holder’s continued service through the applicable
vesting dates, vest and be payable on the earlier of (a) the same time as the Unvested RSU or
Unvested PSU for which the Deferred Cash RSU Award or Deferred Cash PSU Award, respectively,
was exchanged would have vested and been payable pursuant to its service-based vesting schedule
and (b) the first anniversary of the closing date, in each case, subject to full accelerated vesting
upon a termination of employment by the Company without “cause” or a resignation for “good
reason.”
Double-Trigger Deferred Cash RSU Awards and Deferred Cash PSU Awards
As more fully described in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Severance Entitlements” below,
two of Archaea’s current executive officers — Chad Bellah and Edward Taibi — participate in Archaea’s
Executive Severance Plan (the “Executive Severance Plan”), pursuant to which, if they experience a Qualifying
Termination (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Severance Entitlements” below), their
Deferred Cash RSU Awards and Deferred Cash PSU Awards will immediately become vested.
Quantification of Potential Payments for Equity Awards
The tables below set forth (i) the number of unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs, as applicable, as of
October 28, 2022, the assumed date of the Merger solely for the purposes of this disclosure, and held by each
executive officer of Archaea and each non-employee member of the Board and (ii) the estimated value of those
awards (on a pre-tax basis). These estimated values have been calculated assuming the price of a share of
Class A

common stock is $26.00, which represents the per share price. The amounts in the tables below do not include

Severance Entitlements
Two of Archaea’s current executive officers — Chad Bellah and Edward Taibi — participate as Level 1
Executives in the Executive Severance Plan, which provides for certain severance payments and benefits in
connection with certain terminations of employment.
Under the Executive Severance Plan, upon a termination of employment by the Company without “cause”
or a resignation for “good reason,” in each case, on the date of a change in control (which includes the Merger)
or within 24 months immediately thereafter (the “Change in Control Protection Period” and such termination
during the Change in Control Protection Period, a “Qualifying Termination”), Messrs. Bellah and Taibi will each
be eligible to receive the following benefits, subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive Severance Plan:
•
        
a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) the product of (a) 2.0 and (b) the sum of the
executive officer’s (1) base salary and (2) target annual bonus and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the
executive officer’s target annual bonus for the year of termination;
54
Table of Contents
•
        
a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) 24 and (ii) the monthly amount of the
Company’s contribution to the premiums for the executive officer’s group health plan coverage
(including coverage for the executive officer’s spouse and eligible dependents), determined under
the Company’s group health plans as in effect immediately prior to the date of the executive officer’s
termination; and
•
        
vesting in full of the executive officer’s outstanding and unvested equity incentive awards that are
assumed by the acquiring entity in the change in control (which includes the Deferred Cash RSU
Awards and the Deferred Cash PSU Awards).
Under the Executive Severance Plan, “cause” generally means the executive officer’s (i) commission of, or
plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude or the commission of any other act
involving willful malfeasance or material fiduciary breach with respect to the Company or an affiliate;
(ii) substantial and repeated failure to perform duties as reasonably directed by the person to whom the executive
officer reports; (iii) conduct that brings or is reasonably likely to bring the Company or an affiliate negative
publicity or into public disgrace, embarrassment, or disrepute; (iv) gross negligence or willful misconduct with
respect to the Company or an affiliate; (v) material violation of the Company’s written policies or codes of
conduct, including written policies related to discrimination, harassment, performance of illegal or unethical
activities, or ethical misconduct; or (vi) any breach of any non-competition, non-solicitation, no-hire, or
confidentiality covenant between the executive officer and the Company or an affiliate.
Under the Executive Severance Plan, “good reason” generally exists during the Change in Control
Protection Period in the event any of the following actions are taken without the executive officer’s written
consent, subject to certain notice and cure provisions: (i) the executive officer’s authority with the Company or
its affiliates is, or the executive officer’s duties, responsibilities or reporting relationship or structure are,
diminished relative to such executive officer’s authority, duties, responsibilities or reporting relationship or
structure as in effect immediately prior to such change; (ii) a diminution in the authority, duties, responsibilities
or reporting relationship or structure of the person to whom the executive officer is required to report; (iii) a
reduction in the executive officer’s base salary, target annual bonus, long-term incentive opportunity and/or
other employee benefits, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to any such reduction; (iv) a relocation of
the geographic location of the executive officer’s principal place of employment by more than 50 miles from the
location of such executive officer’s then-current principal place of employment; or (v) the Company’s material
failure to comply with the terms of the Executive Severance Plan (including the Company’s failure to obtain
satisfactory agreement from any successor to the Company, its assets, its businesses or its interests (whether as
a result of a change in control or otherwise) to assume and agree to perform the Company’s obligations under
the Executive Severance Plan) or the Company’s material breach of any written agreement between the Company
and the executive officer.
The foregoing severance payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Plan are subject to the
executive officer’s timely execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claims in favor of the Company and its
affiliates and the executive officer’s continued compliance with certain confidentiality, assignment of invention,
cooperation, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants.
The estimated amounts that would be payable to Messrs. Bellah and Taibi in respect of the foregoing
severance entitlements (excluding the amount of unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs, which is more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Quantification of Potential Payments for Equity
Awards” above) if the Merger were to be completed and they were to experience a Qualifying Termination in
connection therewith, and further assuming that the value of COBRA continuation coverage to be $2,000 per
executive officer per month and that the Merger closes on or before, and the Qualifying Termination occurs on,
December 31, 2022 so that the pro-rated portion of the executive officer’s target annual bonus included in the
lump sum cash severance payment is the full amount of the executive officer’s target annual bonus, are
$1,188,000 and $2,298,000, respectively.
Retention Bonuses
One of Archaea’s current executive officers — Edward Taibi — participates in the Company’s retention
bonus program (the “Retention Bonus Program”). Under the Retention Bonus Program, participants are eligible
to receive a cash retention bonus equal to the product of (i) an individual multiplier and (ii) the participant’s
target 2022 total annual compensation. The retention bonuses are payable (a) 50% on the closing date, subject to
the participant’s continued employment through such date, and (b) 50% on the earlier of (1) the date that is
90 days following the closing date, subject to the participant’s continued employment through such date, and
(2) the participant’s termination by the Company without “cause” (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement titled “— Severance
55
Table of Contents
Entitlements” above) or resignation for “good reason” (which generally includes a compensation reduction or a
forced relocation of greater than 50 miles), subject to the individual’s execution and non-revocation of a release
of claims in favor of the Company in connection with such termination. The estimated total amount that would be
payable to Mr. Taibi in respect of his retention bonus if the Merger were to be completed, and subject to
satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, is $5,184,333.
280G Mitigation Actions
Under the Merger Agreement, Archaea may, after consulting with Parent, take the following actions before
the Effective Time to mitigate the amount of potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals”
(each as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), including the
executive officers: (i) enter into a “best after tax cutback” agreement or (ii) assign a value (to be determined by an
outside advisor) to the restrictive covenants applicable to such disqualified individual for purposes of reducing
such disqualified individual’s potential parachute payments. As of the date of this proxy statement, Archaea has
not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of Section 280G of the Code on Archaea or any
disqualified individuals. As of the date of this proxy statement, no executive officer is entitled to receive gross-
ups or tax reimbursements from Archaea with respect to any potential excise taxes.
Archaea Non-Employee Director Compensation
Under the Merger Agreement, Archaea may continue to pay non-employee members of the Board their
annual fees, retainers, equity grants, reimbursements and stipends, in each case, in accordance with the terms of
the Director Compensation Policy. As described above in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Interests
of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” all RSUs held by non-employee directors will
be paid out to the non-employee directors in cash at the per share price in connection with the closing of the
Merger.
Future Arrangements
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Archaea’s directors or executive officers has entered into
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with Parent regarding employment or service with, or
compensation following the Merger to be paid by, Parent, except that, concurrently with Parent’s and Archaea’s
execution of the Merger Agreement, Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy were required to enter into customary
“at-will” employment offer letters with BP America Production Company Inc. (“BP”), which will become effective
upon consummation of the Merger and are described below (the “Conditional Offer Letters”). In addition, prior
to the closing of the Merger, other directors or executive officers of Archaea may discuss or enter into
agreements, arrangements or understandings with Parent regarding employment or service with, or
compensation following the Merger, to be paid by Parent.
On October 16, 2022, as a condition to Parent’s execution of the Merger Agreement, BP entered into the
Conditional Offer Letters with each of Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy. The Conditional Offer Letters
provide that upon and subject to the closing of the Merger, Mr. Stork will become Chief Executive Officer of BP
US BioGas, Mr. Walton will become Chief Development Officer of BP US BioGas, and Mr. McCarthy will become
Chief Commercial Officer of BP US BioGas.
In recognition of their future services to BP, the Conditional Offer Letters provide that Messrs. Stork,
Walton and McCarthy will receive compensation for each of calendar years 2023 and 2024 in an amount not less
than their existing total target compensation with Archaea (base salary, target annual bonus opportunity, and
target long term incentive opportunity) of $3,500,000 for Mr. Stork, $2,000,000 for Mr. Walton and $2,550,000 for
Mr. McCarthy. In the event that the actual compensation received by each of Messrs. Stork, Walton and
McCarthy in 2023 and 2024 is less than their respective minimum compensation amounts set forth above, BP has
agreed to grant each of them restricted stock units in the amount of such shortfall that will vest on March 31,
2025 for the 2023 calendar year compensation and March 31, 2026 for the 2024 calendar year compensation,
subject to continued employment through such vesting dates. Notwithstanding the above, the Conditional Offer
Letters do not guarantee any amount of compensation, nor do they guarantee continued, or initial, employment
at BP.
Subject to the commencement of their employment with BP, the Conditional Offer Letters require each of
Messrs. Stork, Walton and McCarthy to be bound by certain restrictive covenants for a period of 18 months
after the termination of their employment in addition to a 6-month notice period.

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to
holders of Class A common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to
the Merger. This discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the U.S. Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the
date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements set
forth herein. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) regarding any of the tax issues discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not
challenge one or more of the tax consequences of the Merger described in this proxy statement.
This discussion assumes that holders of Class A common stock hold their shares as “capital assets”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does
not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of Class A
common stock in light of such holder’s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local, non-
U.S., or estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within
the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any other aspect of any
U.S. federal tax other than the income tax. This discussion also does not address tax considerations that may be
relevant to holders of Class A common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws,
such as, for example, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds,
partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
other pass-through entities and their partners or members, S corporations, tax-exempt organizations,
governmental organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, traders in securities
who elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, U.S. expatriates and former
citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Class A common stock as
compensation, holders who hold their Class A common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,
conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real
estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Class A
common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or
constructively) an equity interest in Parent or the Surviving Corporation, holders who own both shares of
Class A common stock and Opco Units and holders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger
under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Class A
common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the
partner and activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership holding Class A common stock
or a partner of a partnership holding Class A common stock, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger relevant to you.
This discussion is general in nature and is not tax advice. Holders of Class A common stock are urged to
consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in
light of their particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the Merger arising under the
U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws or under any
state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.
57Table of Contents
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Class A common stock
that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:
•
        
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
        
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;
•
        
a trust if (i) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States
and one or more U.S. persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of the Code);
and
•
        
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Class A common stock
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate that is not a
U.S. holder.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received
pursuant to the Merger (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in a share of Class A common stock will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid
for such share. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the closing. Long-term capital
gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of
U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss must be
calculated separately for each block of Class A common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and
at the same price in a single transaction). U.S. holders who own separate blocks of Class A common stock are
urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these rules.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder will generally not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
        
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-
U.S. holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent
establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such
non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to tax on such gain in
the same manner as a U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such
corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty);
•
        
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-
U.S. holder will generally be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at such lower rate as may be specified under
an applicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder’s net gain realized for the year; or
•
        
the Company is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal
income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending on the date of
the Merger and (ii) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period in the Class A common stock, and, in the
case where the Class A common stock is traded on an established securities market, at any time
during such period, the non-U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5%
of the outstanding Class A common stock, in which case gain recognized by the non-U.S. holder
58
Table of Contents
in the Merger will generally be subject to tax at applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the non-
U.S. holder was a U.S. holder. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation
only if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the
fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a
trade or business.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Proceeds received in connection with the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and
U.S. backup withholding. Backup withholding will generally not apply, however, to a U.S. holder who furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and makes other required certifications, or who is otherwise exempt from
backup withholding and establishes such exempt status (generally, by providing a valid IRS Form W-9). A non-
U.S. holder will generally eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by
providing certification of its foreign status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS
Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and a holder may generally claim a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the
IRS and furnishing any required information.
FATCA
Provisions of the Code (Sections 1471 through 1474) commonly referred to as “FATCA” impose
withholding of 30% on payments of dividends (including constructive dividends) on Archaea common stock.
FATCA withholding under FATCA was scheduled to apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale of
property that produces U.S.-source interest or dividends beginning on January 1, 2019, but on December 13,
2018, the IRS released proposed regulations that, if finalized in their proposed form, would eliminate the
obligation to withhold on gross proceeds. Although these proposed Treasury Regulations are not final,
taxpayers may generally rely on them until final Treasury Regulations are issued.
In general, no FATCA withholding will be required with respect to a U.S. holder or an individual non-
U.S. holder that timely provides the certifications required on a valid IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, respectively.
Holders potentially subject to withholding include “foreign financial institutions” (which is broadly defined for
this purpose and generally includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various
U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of
interests in, or accounts with, those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies (typically certified by
the delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E). If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner
that is not a foreign financial institution will generally be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a
U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). Non-U.S. holders that are
resident in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may
be subject to different rules. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of
FATCA to them.
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. IN ADDITION, THIS
DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, A HOLDER’S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH HOLDER IS
URGED TO CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER TO SUCH HOLDER IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER’S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY STATE,
LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

There can be no assurances that all of the required regulatory approvals, which are summarized below, will
be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurances as to the timing of any approvals.
Each of Parent and the Company are obligated to cooperate and coordinate (and shall cause their
respective affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with one another in making required regulatory filings, in
supplying (or causing to be supplied) any additional information that may be required or requested by the
relevant governmental authorities, and for the HSR Act and subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger
Agreement, are obligated to take (and cause their affiliates to take) all action necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act, in each case as
promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the Termination Date. The parties to the Merger Agreement
also agree to promptly notify one another of any communication from any governmental authority regarding the
Merger and to keep other parties to the Merger Agreement apprised of the status of communications, filings and
authorizations with or from any governmental authority in connection with the Merger.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that the Parent Entities shall not, and shall cause each of their
affiliates not to, enter into, or agree to enter into, agreements for the acquisition of equity interest of any person
that has material operations relating to the development or operation of biogas projects in the United States, or
of assets or rights of any person, which assets or rights are related to the development or operation of biogas
projects in the United States to the extent any such actions would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the ability of the Parent Entities to obtain satisfaction of closing conditions.
U.S. Antitrust
The obligations of Parent and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the waiting period
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act. Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until notifications have been filed and certain information has been
furnished to the FTC and the DOJ and the specified waiting period has expired or has been terminated. The
Company and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the
DOJ and the FTC on October 28, 2022. Both before and after the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the
FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds.
In addition, the Merger may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which
Parent and the Company operate. These authorities may claim that there is authority, under the applicable state
and federal antitrust laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to prohibit the Merger under the
circumstances and based on the standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can be no
assurance that one or more state attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the
Merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, neither Parent nor the Company has been notified by any state
attorney general indicating any plan to review the Merger.
Other Regulatory Approvals and Notifications
The consummation of the Merger is also conditioned on the following: (i) receipt of authorization from
FERC pursuant to Section 203 of the FPA of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the
prior notice period set forth in Schedule 2 of the PJM Tariff, relating to reactive supply and voltage control rate
schedules, shall have lapsed or been waived by FERC (the “Schedule 2 Filing”). The application for the FERC
authorization was filed on October 31, 2022, and Company affiliate INGENCO Wholesale Power, LLC (the only
Company affiliate with a reactive supply and voltage control rate schedule) made its Schedule 2 Filing on the
same date.

Archaea common stock or Opco Units (other than any Owned Company Shares, Owned Opco Units or
Dissenting Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) (i) a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and
which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Archaea common
stock or Opco Units formerly represented by the Certificates. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered will be canceled. Holders of book-entry shares of
Archaea common stock or holders of book-entry Opco Units (the “Book-Entry Equity Interests”) will not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the
payment that such holder is entitled to receive with respect of such Book-Entry Equity Interests. Exchange of
Book-Entry Equity Interests shall be effected in accordance with the Payment Agent’s customary procedures
with respect to securities represented by book-entry.
No interest will be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Equity
Interest. Until so surrendered or exchanged, outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Equity Interests will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof.

so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority will be treated for all purposes
of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding

the Merger Agreement, deliver written notice to each person (other than the Parent Entities and their
representatives) which has received non-public information from the Company or its representatives in
connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal, instructing such person to promptly return
or destroy all such non-public information.
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will be required to enforce, and will not waive, any provision of
any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits a proposal being made to the Archaea Board or any
committee thereof unless the Archaea Board or a committee thereof has determined in good faith that the
enforcement of, or failure to waive, such provision would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. In the event that any representative of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries takes any action at the direction or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which, if
taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of the Company’s no-shop obligations, then the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of its no-shop obligations as though such action were taken by the Company.
If, prior to the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Company’s receipt of
the Archaea stockholder approval, the Archaea Board receives a bona fide unsolicited, written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach, in any material respect, of the Company’s no-shop obligations, that
the Archaea Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the
Archaea Board’s fiduciary duties

under applicable law, the Company is entitled to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records, personnel or joint venture partners of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement to, the person making such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will provide to Parent any non-public information or data that is provided to such
person and was not previously made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with such
information being provided to such person.
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, Archaea agreed to as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event, within 36 hours) notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, offers
or proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company,
any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their directors, officers or members of the deal team with respect to the
Transactions or any financial advisor or outside legal counsel to the Company in connection with the
Transactions (all of the foregoing collectively, the “Specified Group”), or of which any of them becomes aware.
Such notice must include (i) the identity of the person or group making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries,
offers or proposals, (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries,
offers or proposals, (iii) if applicable, copies of all proposed agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiries, offers or proposals (and all other documents proposing any financial terms, form of consideration or
material terms relating to conditionality, termination or termination fees, regulatory efforts or financing in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals), and (iv) if applicable, copies of all
substantive written or electronic communications (and summaries of all substantive oral communications to the
extent not already covered by the preceding materials) proposing financial terms, form of consideration, material
terms relating to conditionality, termination or termination fees, regulatory efforts or financing in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals provided by such person or group or any of their
representatives to Archaea or any member of the Specified Group or of which they become aware (or by Archaea
or any of its representatives to such person or group or any of their representatives) (clauses (ii)-(iv), the
“Specified Materials”). The Company must also (a) keep Parent reasonably informed, as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within 36 hours after the receipt from or delivery to such person, of each material change to the
status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and any related discussions or negotiations and (b) provide
Parent copies of all Specified Materials, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 36 hours following
receipt from, or delivery to, such person or group or any of their representatives, or of the awareness thereof, by
Archaea, any of its subsidiaries or any member of the Specified Group.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal, indication
of interest or expression of intent (other than an offer or proposal by any Parent Entity) relating to an
Acquisition Transaction. Furthermore, the term “Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of
related transactions (other than the Merger) involving:
•
        
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of shares of more than 20% of the outstanding
Archaea common stock (or any equity securities convertible into, or exchangeable or redeemable for,
Archaea common stock) after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or acquisition,
including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a person
beneficially owning shares of Archaea common stock (or any equity securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or redeemable for, Archaea common stock) representing more than 20% of the Archaea
common stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer;
•
        
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of more than 20% of the consolidated assets, net
revenue or net income of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Company Board);
•
        
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to which any person would hold, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the equity
interests, or more than 20% of the aggregate voting power of the equity interests, of the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction or
more than 20% of the consolidated assets, net revenue or net income of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith
by the Company Board); or
•
        
any combination of the foregoing.
72
Table of Contents
For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement will not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Superior Proposal” means any unsolicited written offer for an
Acquisition Transaction that did not result from a breach, in any material respect, by the Company of its
obligations under the no-shop provisions, by any person or group (other than Parent or any of its affiliates) that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) (i) would be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders than the Merger
from a financial point of view (taking into account all legal, regulatory, financial, timing, financing and other
aspects of such proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) considers relevant and any revisions
to the Merger Agreement committed to in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination) and (ii) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed (taking into account all legal, regulatory, financial,
timing, financing and other aspects of such proposal that the Company Board considers relevant). For purposes
of the reference to an “Acquisition Transaction” in this definition, (a) all references to “20%” in the definition of
“Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “70%” calculated excluding any “rollover” of
Archaea common stock by existing holders thereof and (b) the reference to “other transaction” in clause (iii) of
the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” shall be deemed to exclude joint ventures, recapitalizations,
reorganizations, liquidations or dissolutions.
Archaea Board Recommendation Change
The Archaea Board, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of
the Merger Agreement and the Company’s receipt of the Archaea stockholder approval, may not (any of the
following actions, a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
•
        
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, its
recommendation to Archaea stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Company Board
Recommendation”) in a manner adverse to Parent;
•
        
adopt, approve or recommend to the Company’s stockholders an Acquisition Proposal;
•
        
fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 business days following the written
request of Parent (provided, however, that Parent may make such request no more than two times in
the aggregate);
•
        
fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender or exchange offer for shares of Archaea common
stock subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
within 10 business days after the commencement thereof or fail to maintain such a recommendation
against such offer at any time before the expiration or withdrawal thereof; or
•
        
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement.
In addition, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company may enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, from the date of the Merger
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Company’s receipt of
the Archaea stockholder approval, the Archaea Board or any committee of the Archaea Board may make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to (i) a Superior Proposal, if it determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or (ii) any material change,
event, effect, development or circumstance occurring after the date of the Merger Agreement that was (a) not
known or reasonably foreseeable or the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to
the Company Board on the date of the Merger Agreement (or, if known by the Company Board, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of the
Merger Agreement) and (b) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto, any
change, in and of itself, in the stock price of the Company or any breach by the Company of the Merger
Agreement (an “Intervening Event”), if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
subject in each case to compliance with the procedures described below.
73
Table of Contents
In the case of a Superior Proposal, no adverse recommendation change and/or termination of the Merger
Agreement may be made:
•
        
until after the fourth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising
Parent that the Archaea Board intends to resolve to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the third party making such
Superior Proposal, the material terms of such Superior Proposal and copies of all agreements
(including any related schedules, appendices, exhibits or other attachments) relating to such
Superior Proposal, including any financing commitments related thereto (with any amendment to the
financial terms, form of consideration or any other material term of such Superior Proposal requiring a
new written notice of superior proposal with a new notice period of three business days);
•
        
unless during such four business day period (or three business day period following an amended
proposal), the Company negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination; and
•
        
unless at the end of the notice period and prior to taking any such action, the Company Board has
considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel), that (i) such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the failure to take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, in each case if such
changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
In the case of an Intervening Event, no adverse recommendation change may be made:
•
        
until after the fourth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising
Parent that the Archaea Board or any committee of the Archaea Board intends to take such action
and specifying the basis for such change in the Company Board Recommendation and describing
such Intervening Event in reasonable detail (with any change in any material respect to the
Intervening Event requiring a new written notice of the Intervening Event with a new notice period
of three business days);
•
        
unless prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
representatives, during such four business day period, negotiated with Parent and its
representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner that
would obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change; and
•
        
unless at the end of the notice period and prior to taking any such action, the Company Board has
considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would
continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect.

not stay, toll or extend an applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement or

of the other parties, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Each of the Parent Entities or the Company Entities may, with the consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), cause both parties to take all reasonable
actions required to withdraw the Notification and Report Form relating to the Merger Agreement and the Merger
as required by the HSR Act and to refile on a date agreed upon between outside counsel for Parent and the
Company.
Subject to applicable law, each of the Parent Entities or the Company Entities will (and will cause their
respective subsidiaries to) (i) promptly notify the other parties to the Merger Agreement of any material
communications received by such person from a governmental authority in connection with the Merger (and, if
in writing, provide the other parties with copies of such material communications and, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other parties of the contents of such material communications), (ii) permit the other
parties to review and discuss in advance (and consider in good faith any comments) any proposed draft

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, neither any Parent Entity nor any of
their respective affiliates will be required to, and, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company and
its Subsidiaries will not, agree to, offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise:
•
        
the sale, divestiture, license, transfer, disposition, or hold separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise), of any or all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets

required consents applicable to the Merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by
any person in any court or before any governmental authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal,

foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement will require the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to
enter into any agreement or consent decree with the DOJ, FTC or any other governmental authority that is not
conditioned on the closing.
Until the earlier of the valid termination of the Merger Agreement and the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, the Parent Entities will not, and will cause their affiliates not to, enter into,
agree to enter into, or consummate any contracts for an acquisition by stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
purchase of assets or otherwise, of (i) the equity interests of any person that has material operations relating to
the development or operation of biogas projects in the United States or (ii) assets or rights of any person, which
assets or rights are related to the development or operation of biogas projects in the United States, in each case
to the extent any such entrance, agreement or consummation would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of the Parent Entities to obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger. The foregoing will
not be construed in any way to prevent or restrict any agreement for an offtake supply arrangement in the
ordinary course of business of the Parent Entities or their affiliates.

notifications to the NYSE in a timely manner. The Company agreed to hold the Special Meeting no more than
30 days following the initial mailing of this proxy statement to the Company’s stockholders.

The Company will not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided that the Company will postpone or adjourn
the Special Meeting:
•
        
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the stockholder approval; or
•
        
for the absence of a quorum;
provided that without the prior written consent of Parent, the Special Meeting will not be cumulatively delayed
to a date that is later than the earlier of (i) 45 days following the originally scheduled stockholder meeting and
(ii) the date that is three business days prior to the Termination Date.
The Company may also postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting:
•
        
if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the stockholder meeting by a specific order or a
specific request from the SEC or its staff (provided that, without the prior consent of Parent, each
such postponement or adjournment may be for no more than the amount of time specified in the
order or request); or
•
        
if the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that it is required by applicable law to postpone or adjourn the stockholder meeting in order to give
the Company’s stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the
Company has sent or otherwise made available to its stockholders (including in connection with any
Company Board Recommendation Change) (provided that, without the prior written consent of
Parent, the stockholder meeting will not be so delayed by more than 10 business days and, in any
event, may not be delayed to a date that is later than three business days prior to the Termination
Date).
Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company has agreed to use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; provided that any Company Board Recommendation Change will not relieve the Company
from its obligations to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis
and upon Parent’s written request regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the mailing of the

on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement, any other
required Company filing or any other required Parent filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then the party to the Merger Agreement that discovers such information will promptly notify the

As of the Effective Time, the surviving entities and their subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the
surviving entities and their subsidiaries to, subject to applicable law, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the
obligations of Archaea and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements existing on the date of
the Merger Agreement, true and complete copies of which have been made available to Parent, between the
Company and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors,
officers or employees, on the other hand (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors and administrators,
a “Contractually Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Contractually Indemnified Persons”) with respect to
acts or omissions by a Contractually Indemnified Person occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
for a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving entities or any of their subsidiaries will, and
Parent will cause the surviving entities and their subsidiaries to, subject to applicable law, cause all the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses with regard to acts or omissions by Contractually
Indemnified Persons occurring at or prior to the Effective Time that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the organizational documents
of the Company and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, which
provisions will not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the Contractually
Indemnified Persons for a six-year period after the Effective Time, except as required by applicable law.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving entities and their subsidiaries will, and
Parent will cause the surviving entities and their subsidiaries to, indemnify and hold harmless, subject to and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each current or former director and officer (and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company and any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (each such
person, together with such person’s heirs, executors and administrators, an “Indemnified Person”) from and
against any costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted,
to the extent that such legal proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to
the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of Archaea or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time; and any action or omission (including the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger), or
alleged action or omission, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or taken at the request of Archaea or such
subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such subsidiary as a director
or officer, trustee or fiduciary of another person).
If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent
a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the Merger Agreement, then the claim asserted
in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such legal proceeding, the surviving entities will advance all reasonable fees and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of such legal proceeding; provided that such person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective affiliates will settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination
of, any legal proceeding for which indemnification is being sought by an Indemnified Person unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person
from all liability arising out of such legal proceeding or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing
thereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Parent (or its designated affiliate) will purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the Company’s
current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, to be effective as of the Effective Time, from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed 300% of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is referred to as the maximum premium. Parent will
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective
Time. Prior to purchasing such “tail” policy, Parent will allow the Company to review the terms of such “tail”
policy and will consider in good faith any comments made by the Company. If Parent (or its designated affiliate)
is unable to obtain the “tail” policy for an aggregate cost less than or equal to the maximum premium, Parent (or

For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) provide each employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
and who continues employment with Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving Corporation)
immediately following the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) a base salary or wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than that applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately before the
Effective Time and (ii) cash target incentive opportunities (including bonus and commission opportunities, but
excluding any one-time, special or nonrecurring bonuses), allowance or other payments, equity or equity-based
target incentive opportunities (excluding any one-time, special or nonrecurring equity or equity-based
opportunities), and all other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in
effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the 12 months
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide agreed upon severance payments to eligible employees.
In addition, Parent has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take certain actions with respect to benefit
and compensation plans made available to Continuing Employees at or within a period of 12 months commencing
immediately after the Effective Time, including recognizing prior service with the Company and its subsidiaries
for certain purposes and crediting certain previously paid amounts in the same plan year, in each case, subject to
certain exceptions.
With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”),
for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) pay to each Continuing Employee who
remains employed with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates through the end of such
fiscal year, at the same time or times that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their applicable affiliate pays
annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other similarly situated employees thereof but in no event later
than March 15 immediately after the end of such fiscal year, a bonus for such fiscal year (the “Annual Bonus”)
that is equal to the Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee is entitled to receive under the applicable
Company Incentive Plan based on actual level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such
fiscal year (as determined after giving appropriate effect to the Merger). If a Continuing Employee’s employment
is terminated without “cause” or due to the Continuing Employee’s resignation with “good reason” (which
includes a reduction in base salary or a forced location of greater than 50 miles) before payment of the Annual
Bonus (a “qualifying termination”), the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (or Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) pay such Continuing Employee, no later than 10 days following
the date of such qualifying termination, a pro-rated portion of the target Annual Bonus that such Continuing
Employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan for such fiscal year
if such Continuing Employee had remained employed, with such proration based on the relative portion of the
fiscal year during which such Continuing Employee was employed with the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective affiliates.
The Merger Agreement provides that the foregoing provisions under this section of this proxy statement
titled “Employee Benefits Matters” will not be deemed to: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to terminate any
Continuing Employee; (ii) amend any employee plan (or to prohibit Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
amending or terminating any employee plan, subject to and in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required pursuant to applicable law) or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee
or former employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other person (other than the parties to the
Merger Agreement).

Any valid termination of the Merger Agreement will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written
notice by the terminating party to the other parties, and the Merger Agreement will be of no further force or
effect without liability of any party to the other parties, as applicable, except that certain provisions of the
Merger Agreement, including the provisions regarding the effect of termination and payment of termination fees
and related expenses and the general provisions contained in Article IX of the Merger Agreement, will survive
termination. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, no termination of the Merger
Agreement (or payment of any Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee (as defined below) will
relieve any party from any liability for fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of the Merger
Agreement. If Company has received the Parent Termination Fee and is entitled to monetary damages on account
of fraud or willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent in excess of such Parent Termination
Fee, then the amount of the Parent Termination Fee will be credited and offset against the amount of such
damages. If Parent has received the Company Termination Fee and is entitled to monetary damages on account
of fraud or willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement by any of the Company Entities in excess of such
Company Termination Fee, then the amount of the Company Termination Fee will be credited and offset against
the amount of such damages. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “willful and material breach” means a
material breach that is a consequence of a deliberate act or deliberate failure to act undertaken by the breaching
party with the actual knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would cause or constitute or would
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of the Merger Agreement.

Fee”) if (i) the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by (a) either Parent or the Company for a Termination Date
Termination (provided that, at the Termination Date, the Archaea stockholder approval has not been obtained or
the Special Meeting has not been held or Parent has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement due to a
Company Breach Termination), (b) either Parent or the Company for a Stockholder Vote Termination or (z) Parent
for a Company Breach Termination, (ii) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced
or disclosed and, in the case of a Stockholder Vote Termination or a Termination Date Termination or Company
Breach Termination at a time when either party has the right to effect a Stockholder Vote Termination, is not
withdrawn or otherwise abandoned (without qualification) at least one business day before a vote is taken on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) within 12 months following such termination, either an
Acquisition Transaction (which need not be the Acquisition Proposal referenced in clause (ii) above), is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an
Acquisition Transaction (which consummation may be outside of such 12-month period) (or is subsequently
terminated before consummation but a subsequent Acquisition Transaction is entered into in connection with

Agreement for a Recommendation Change Termination or (ii) the Company terminates the Merger Agreement for
a Superior Proposal Termination.
Parent will be required to pay Company a termination fee of $327.2 million if the Merger Agreement is
validly terminated by either Parent or the Company for (i) a Legal Restraint Termination (provided that, such
Legal Restraint is in respect of any antitrust law or because FERC has not yet issued an order pursuant to
Section 203 of the FPA authorizing the Merger) or (ii) a Termination Date Termination and, in either case, at least
one of the conditions to closing relating to the expiration or termination of any antitrust waiting periods, FERC
authorization or the absence of any Legal Restraint (with respect to the absence of any Legal Restraint, solely to
the extent such condition has not been satisfied in respect of, pursuant to or arising under any antitrust law or
because FERC has not yet issued an order pursuant to Section 203 of the FPA authorizing the Merger) has not
been satisfied or waived and all other conditions to the obligations of the Parent Entities have been satisfied or
waived.
The liability of the Company for any monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches under the
Merger Agreement is capped at the Company Termination Fee plus any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of Parent in connection with a legal proceeding brought by Parent against the
Company which results in a judgment against the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, together with interest on the amount of the payment. The liability of Parent for any monetary damages
payable for breaches under the Merger Agreement is capped at the Parent Termination Fee plus any reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Company in connection with a legal proceeding
brought by the Company against Parent which results in a judgment against Parent to pay the Parent
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, together with interest on the amount of the payment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no termination of the Merger Agreement (or payment of any Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee) will relieve any party to the Merger Agreement from liability for fraud or any willful and material
breach of the Merger Agreement by such party prior to termination.

Under the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value
of your shares of Archaea common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with
interest, if any, as determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration you would otherwise be entitled to
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL described herein. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders and beneficial owners electing
to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their
rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.
This section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to
appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal
rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is accessible
at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and
incorporated by reference herein. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and this section to “stockholder” are
to the record holder of the shares of Archaea common stock, and all references in Section 262 of the DGCL and
this section to “beneficial owner” are a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of stock held either in
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The following discussion does not constitute
any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not an Archaea stockholder
or beneficial owner should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders of
shares of Archaea common stock who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares to the Company
prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (iii) continuously own such shares through the Effective Time; and (iv) otherwise comply
with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have
their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger
Consideration. Any such Archaea stockholder or beneficial owner awarded “fair value” for his, her or its shares
by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, that which Archaea stockholders will receive pursuant to
the Merger Agreement.
Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting
to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less
than 20 days before the Special Meeting. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, or information directing the
stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed
without subscription or cost, must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to
the Company’s stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger in
compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the applicable statutory
provisions is accessible at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.
Stockholders and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the
right to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure
to comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the
loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in
respect of the Company unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking
appraisal. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal,
stockholders and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own
legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. An Archaea
stockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration.

How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights",97,98
Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights,"How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are an Archaea stockholder or beneficial owner and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of
your shares of Archaea common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
•
        
You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does
not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you are a
holder of record of shares of Archaea, your written demand must reasonably inform us of the
identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its
shares. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Archaea, your written demand must (i) reasonably
identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made; (ii) provide documentary
evidence of your beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and
correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provide an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the Company and the office of Register in Chancery;
•
        
Your failure to make a written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is
taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights;
•
        
You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet
or by telephone, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted
and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which does not contain
voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Therefore, a stockholder or beneficial owner who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must instruct the proxy to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
        
You must continuously own your shares of Archaea common stock from the date of making the
demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares
before the Effective Time;
•
        
Any person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, and who is
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the
Effective Time. The Company is under no obligation to file any petition and has no present intention
of doing so; and
•
        
You must otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL.
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Archaea
common stock. If you exercise your appraisal rights, you will receive no payment of the Merger Consideration
unless you withdraw or otherwise lose your demand for appraisal.
In addition, because the Class A common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected
to continue to be listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Class A common stock, unless (i) the
total number of shares of Class A common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
Class A common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. We refer to conditions (i) and (ii) as the
“ownership thresholds.” At least one of the ownership thresholds must be met in order for the Company’s
stockholders or beneficial owners to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Class A common
stock.
90Table of Contents
Voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or
failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as
required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any
proxy or vote. However, you must not vote your shares via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in order to exercise your appraisal rights with respect to such
shares.
Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights",98,99
Archaea Energy Inc._20221114_DEFM14A_20445339_4545162.Pdf,Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights,"Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights
Holders of record of shares of Archaea common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time may assert appraisal rights for the shares of Archaea common stock registered in that holder’s
name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. The demand should
set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock
ledger). The demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock.
Beneficial owners may perfect appraisal rights if such beneficial owner (i) reasonably identifies in his, her
or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (ii) provides documentary
evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a
true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provides an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the Company and the office of Register in Chancery. If you have a
beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as in bank or brokerage accounts
or in other nominee forms, you may perfect your appraisal rights by following the steps set forth above.
If you hold your shares in bank or brokerage accounts or other nominee forms, and you wish such holder,
as the holder of record of your shares, to exercise appraisal rights on your behalf, you are urged to consult with
your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to make a demand for appraisal of those shares. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or other
nominee, who holds shares of common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise his, her or its
right of appraisal with respect to the shares of common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not
exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of
shares of common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of common stock is
expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of common stock held in the name of the
holder of record.
If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage who in turn holds the shares through a central
securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or
on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the holder of record.
If you own shares of Archaea common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy
or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a
stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose
the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of record.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written
demand to:

If the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation will give written notice of the Effective Time
within 10 days after the Effective Time to Archaea stockholders and beneficial owners who did not vote in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who made a written demand for appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Company stockholder or
beneficial owner that made a demand for appraisal but did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such
a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of Archaea common stock, but
after such 60-day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the
Surviving Corporation. In addition, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
as to any stockholder or beneficial owner without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which
approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that
this provision will not affect the right of any Archaea stockholder or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal
demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in
the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either a record holder
or a beneficial owner of Archaea common stock, provided such person has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Surviving Corporation must
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on
the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding an
appraisal of the value of the shares of Archaea common stock held by all stockholders and beneficial owners
who have properly demanded appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file an appraisal
petition and has no present intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised, you should
initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the
manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written
request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Archaea common stock not voted in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Archaea has received demands for
appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this
statement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request therefor
or (ii) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner
of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf, you may, in
your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in
this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Archaea
common stock who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the
office of the Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have
demanded appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the Surviving Corporation. At the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine which persons have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and have become
entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders demanding appraisal
who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of
the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as
to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss
proceedings as to all persons if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met. Where proceedings
are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the
shares of Archaea common stock at the Effective Time held by all persons who have properly perfected appraisal
rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through
the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded
92Table of Contents
quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment.
However, the Surviving Corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry
of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each person entitled to appraisal. If the
Surviving Corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL,
interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the
Surviving Corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary cash payment before such
payment was made, unless such interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is made. When the fair
value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, together with interest,
less any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, to the stockholders and beneficial owners entitled to
receive the same, upon such terms and conditions that the Delaware Chancery Court may order.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered
in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should
be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of
a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
factors which were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on
future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising
from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of
the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Archaea common stock as determined under
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value that you are entitled to receive
under the terms of the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness
from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in
any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Moreover, neither Archaea nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to anyone
exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the
“fair value” of a share of Archaea common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No representation is
made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of such shares, then all Archaea stockholders and
beneficial owners will lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the Merger Consideration described
in the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate
those costs to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the
circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed by the Surviving Corporation
who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees
and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Archaea common
stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award
pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.

Table of Contents
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or
after the Effective Time, vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other
distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Archaea
common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you
may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of
the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration to the Surviving Corporation, except
that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the
Surviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to
any stockholder or beneficial owner without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may
be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision
will not affect the right of any person that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw its demand for appraisal and to
accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If
you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or lose the appraisal right, your shares of
Archaea common stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, less any withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in
the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your
shares of Archaea common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement without interest. In view of the
complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights
under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.
The process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of
Section 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own
legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there
are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.

guarantee that it will be included in our proxy statement and any submitted stockholder proposal must comply

other things, stockholders give timely written notice to the Corporate Secretary of Archaea regarding such

To be timely, a stockholder who intends to present nominations or a proposal at the 2023 annual meeting of
stockholders other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 must provide the information set forth in our bylaws to the
Corporate Secretary of Archaea no earlier than January 18, 2023 and no later than February 17, 2023. However, if
we hold the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders more than 30 days before, or more than 60 days after, the
anniversary of the date of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, then the information must be received no
earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, and not later than (i) the
90th day prior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) the 10th day after public disclosure of
the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, whichever is later. If a stockholder fails to meet these
deadlines and fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 14a-4 under the Exchange Act, we may exercise
discretionary voting authority under proxies we solicit to vote on any such proposal as we determine
appropriate.
We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any
nomination or proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.

Share Price and (B) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company
PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Vested RSU Consideration, the “Equity
Award Consideration”); provided, that to the extent any Deemed Vested Company PSU remains outstanding and
subject to such performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance
metrics applicable to such Deemed Vested Company PSU will be deemed achieved at maximum performance
effective as of the Effective Time, without any pro-ration.
(ii) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company PSU outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time will automatically, without any action on the part of the Parties or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into an award representing a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest
thereon and subject to applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Price and (B) the
total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company PSU as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the “Deferred Cash PSU Award”); provided, that to the extent any Unvested
Company PSU remains outstanding and subject to performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the performance metrics applicable to such Unvested Company PSU will be deemed achieved at
maximum performance effective as of the Effective Time, without any proration. From and after the Effective Time,
the Deferred Cash PSU Award will be subject to the same service-based vesting schedule and substantially the
same other terms and conditions applicable to the Unvested Company PSU to which it relates as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided that each Deferred Cash PSU Award will (x) continue to vest based solely
on continued service with Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), (y)
to the extent not yet fully vested by the first anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with its service-
based vesting schedule, will become fully vested on such date, subject to the holder’s continued service with
Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through such date (except as
set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter) and (z) be settled in cash.
(c) Order of Acceleration. The determination of which Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by
an individual holder (each, an “Equity Award Holder” and collectively, the “Equity Award Holders”) that will be
converted into Deemed Vested Company RSUs and Deemed Vested Company PSUs, respectively, shall be based
on the relative vesting dates of such Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by such Equity Award Holder,
such that Company RSUs and Company PSUs that would have vested closest in time following the Effective
Time based on the vesting schedules as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will convert to Deemed Vested
Company RSUs and Deemed Vested Company PSUs first until the requisite percentage is achieved. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Deferred Cash RSU Award or Deferred Cash PSU Award, as applicable, that an Equity
Award Holder receives upon conversion of such Equity Award Holder’s Company RSUs and Company PSUs
shall represent those Company RSUs and Company PSUs with the longest remaining vesting periods as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate Equity Award Consideration
owed to all Equity Award Holders. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the end
of the first regular payroll period commencing after the Closing Date, the Equity Award Holders will be paid by
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system, payroll provider or accounts payable, as
applicable, all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Vested Company RSUs, Deemed Vested
Company RSUs, Vested Company PSUs and Deemed Vested Company PSUs, in each case, that are cancelled and
converted into the Equity Award Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b)(i), less any
required withholding pursuant to Section 2.13.
(e) Further Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company or the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof), as applicable, shall take all action necessary to effect the cancellation and
conversion of Company RSUs and Company PSUs and otherwise to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). The provisions of any
Employee Plan or Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of Company
Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time.
2.9 Payment of Merger Consideration.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) appoint a nationally recognized bank or trust
company selected by Parent (reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as the payment agent for the
Mergers (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
Annex A-21
Table of Contents
(b) Payment Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Opco Units pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock or Opco Units become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, such cash shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in (i) obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, the United States or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days;
(ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &
Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Payment
Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the
Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the
cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b); or (C) all or any portion of the Payment Fund is
unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b) for any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the
Payment Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment
Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b). Any income from investment of
the Payment Fund shall be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation as Parent directs. The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Common Stock and Opco
Units as contemplated by Section 2.7(a) or Section 2.7(b).
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Closing Date (and in any event within three
Business Days after the Closing Date), the Parent Entities shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or Opco Merger Effective Time, as applicable (other than
Dissenting Company Shares, Owned Company Shares or Owned Opco Units), of one or more certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time or Opco Merger Effective Time, as applicable, represented issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) or Opco Units (other than
Owned Opco Units) (the “Certificates” (if any)) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Per Share Price payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Opco Units
formerly represented thereby pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7, and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of book-entry shares of Company
Common Stock or holder of book-entry Opco Units (the “Book-Entry Equity Interests”) will be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7 with respect of such Book-Entry Equity Interests and
the Payment Agent shall not be required to mail such holders a letter of transmittal. Exchange of Book-Entry
Equity Interests shall be effected in accordance with the Payment Agent’s customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book-entry. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates and Book-Entry Equity Interests on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates and exchange of Book-Entry Equity Interests pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered or
exchanged, outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Equity Interests shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Equity Interests in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting such exchange present
proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Equity Interest surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable.
Annex A-22
Table of Contents
(e) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Entities or any other Party shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Opco Units for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(f) Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Equity Interests on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by Parent) upon demand,
and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Opco Units that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Mergers who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Book-
Entry Equity Interests representing such shares of Company Common Stock or Opco Units for exchange
pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall thereafter look for payment of the consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock or Opco Units represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Equity
Interests solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), as general creditors thereof,
for any claim to the consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Equity Interests five years after the
Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders
(and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.
(g) Preparation of Funds Flow. In advance of the Closing, the Parties will cooperate in preparing a
funds flow memorandum that documents the payments to be made in connection with the Closing (including in
respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, Opco Units, Company Warrants or Company Indebtedness,
and payments of expenses to made in connection with the Closing).
2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Equity Interests are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.
2.11 No Further Ownership Rights in Opco Units. From and after the Opco Merger Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Opco of Opco Units that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, transfers effected prior to the Opco Merger Effective Time in
accordance with the Organizational Documents of Opco. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Equity Interests are presented to the Surviving Opco for any reason, they shall (subject to compliance with the
exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
2.12 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Payment Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may,
in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
2.13 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, the Parties, and the Surviving Entities (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Law in respect of applicable
Taxes. The Parent Entities shall, upon becoming aware of any required deduction or withholding (other than (a)
withholding because of the compensatory nature of the applicable payment, (b) U.S. backup withholding or (c)
withholding under Section 1445(a) or Section 1446(f) of the Code), use reasonable best efforts to provide notice
to the Company of any such deduction or withholding and use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the
Company to minimize or eliminate such deduction or withholding to the extent permitted by Law; provided that
for purposes of such deduction or withholding, the Parties acknowledge that (i) the Payment Agent is generally
intended to act as withholding agent with respect to non-compensatory payments hereunder, (ii) with respect to
any payments to be made by the Payment
Annex A-23
Table of Contents
Agent, the Parent Entities shall have no obligation of independent inquiry with respect to whether any
withholding or deduction is required and (iii) with respect to any payments to be made by the Payment Agent,
the Parent Entities shall only be required to provide notice with respect to any anticipated withholding or
deduction to the extent they receive notice of the same from the Payment Agent. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.
2.14 Treatment of Company Warrants. The Company Warrants shall be redeemed for cash immediately
following the Opco Merger Effective Time in accordance with the terms of Section 4.4 of the Company Warrant
Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment. Holders of such Company Warrants shall be entitled to
receive, following the Opco Merger Effective Time, the net cash consideration described in the Warrant
Agreement Amendment. The issuer of the Company Warrants shall pay such cash consideration to the holders
of the Company Warrants through the Payment Agent and the Payment Fund shall have sufficient cash to cover
such payments in addition to the payments required by Sections 2.7(a) and 2.7(b).

Letter) have been made available by the Company to Parent or are included in the Company SEC Documents.

delivered by each Company Entity and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Parent
Entities, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company Entities, enforceable against the
Company Entities in accordance with its terms, except that (A) such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors’ rights generally and (B) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other

Engagement Letter; (iii) determined that the Voting Agreements and the Warrant Agreement Amendment are

(b) Fairness Opinion. The Company Board has received from BofA Securities, Inc., an opinion in
writing or orally, in which case, such opinion has been or will be subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth
therein, the Per Share Price to be received in the Company Merger by the holders of Company Class A Common
Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company
shall provide to Parent, solely for informational purposes, a copy of such written opinion following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement.
(c) Anti-Takeover Laws. Assuming the accuracy of the representations of the Parent Entities set
forth in Section 4.6 (disregarding the word “to the Knowledge of Parent” appearing therein), the Company Board
has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the

interest or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (B) furnish
to any Person (other than any Parent Entity or any designees of any Parent Entity) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the business, properties,

Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (C) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person or its Representatives with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by such Person (or inquiries, proposals,

Section 5.3; (D) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or (E) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of

the terms of Section 5.3(b), the Company shall, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, cease and
shall, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, cease and terminate, (x)
any solicitations, discussions, communications or negotiations with any Person (other than the Parties and their
respective Representatives) relating to an Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals, indications of interest or
offers that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) by such Person, in each case that
exists as of the date of this Agreement, and (y) all access of any Person (other than the Parties and their
respective Representatives) to any electronic or physical data room maintained by the Company with respect to
a possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within five Business Days
after the date hereof) deliver written notice to each Person (other than the Parent Entities and their
Representatives), which has received non-public information from the Company or its Representatives in
connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal, that such Person promptly return or
destroy all non-public information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to any such Person to
the extent contemplated by the applicable confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person. The
Company shall enforce, and shall not waive, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that
prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof) unless
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith that the enforcement of, or failure to waive,
such provision would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In
the event that any Representative of the Company or
Annex A-44
Table of Contents
any of its Subsidiaries takes any action at the direction or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 5.3, then the Company shall be
deemed to be in breach of this Section 5.3 as though such action were taken by the Company.
(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, until
the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company’s receipt of
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly
or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books, records, personnel or joint venture partners, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person or its Representatives that
has delivered to the Company a bona fide unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that is not the result of a breach, in any material respect, of this Section 5.3 and that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that, with respect to any such Person that is
a competitor to the Company, competitively sensitive information will only be provided subject to customary
“clean team” or similar arrangements; provided further, that, subject to applicable Law and any applicable “clean
team” or similar arrangement, the Company shall provide to the Parent any non-public information or data that is
provided to any Person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with such information being provided to such Person.
(c) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. Except as permitted by Section 5.3(d), the Company Board shall not:
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend
or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (B) adopt, approve or
recommend to the Company Stockholders an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following the written request of Parent (provided, however, that
Parent may make such request no more than two (2) times in the aggregate); (D) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender or exchange offer for shares of Company Common Stock subject to Regulation 14D
under the Exchange Act that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement thereof or fail to maintain such a recommendation against such offer at any time before the
expiration or withdrawal thereof; or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”);
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (2) the public disclosure by the Company
of such determination; or (3) the delivery by the Company of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d), in each
case, in and of itself and to the extent made in compliance with this Section 5.3, shall constitute a Company
Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.
(d) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:
(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that, the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) shall not effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days
in advance (such notice period, including any extension thereto in accordance with this Section 5.3(d)(i), the
“Intervening Event Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change and describe such Intervening Event in reasonable detail;
Annex A-45
Table of Contents
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and
its Representatives shall, during such the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change; provided, that in the event the Intervening Event to which this provision applies
thereafter changes in any material respect, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(i) with respect to such new written notice, it being
understood that the “Intervening Event Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will extend for the
longer of three Business Days after the delivery of such new written notice and until the end of the original
Intervening Event Notice Period; and
(3) at the end of the Intervening Event Notice Period and prior to taking any such action,
the Company Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of
this Agreement, and has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel), that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would continue to be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes
proposed by Parent were to be given effect; or
(ii) if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(h) in order to enter concurrently into a binding written definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, that, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not
take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) unless:
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent four Business Days in
advance (such notice period, including any extension thereto in accordance with this Section 5.3(d)(ii), the
“Acquisition Proposal Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to
take the actions described in clauses (A) or (B) of Section 5.3(d)(ii), including the identity of the Person or Group
making such Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and full copies of all agreements (including any related
schedules, appendices, exhibits or other attachments) relating to such Superior Proposal, including any
financing commitments relating thereto;
(3) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the
Company and its Representatives, during the Acquisition Proposal Notice Period, have negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h); provided, that in
the event of any material modifications to such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change to the
financial terms or form of consideration (or material terms relating to conditionality, termination and termination
fees, regulatory efforts or financing) of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the Company will
be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(ii)
with respect to such new written notice, it being understood that the “Acquisition Proposal Notice Period” in
respect of such new written notice will extend for the longer of three Business Days after the delivery of such
new written notice and until the end of the original Acquisition Proposal Notice Period; and
(4) at the end of the Acquisition Proposal Notice Period and prior to taking any such
action, the Company Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the
terms of this Agreement, and has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel), that (x) such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) the
failure to take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in each case if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
(e) Notice. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 36
hours) notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, offers or proposals that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their directors,
Annex A-46

counsel to the Company in connection with the Transactions (all of the foregoing collectively, the “Specified
Group”) or of which any of them becomes aware. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or Group
making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals, (ii) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals, (iii) if applicable, copies of all
proposed agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals (and all other
documents proposing any financial terms, form of consideration or material terms relating to conditionality,
termination or termination fees, regulatory efforts or financing in connection with such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiries, offers or proposals); (iv) if applicable, copies of all substantive written or electronic communications
(and summaries of all substantive oral communications to the extent not already covered by the preceding
materials) proposing financial terms, form of consideration, material terms relating to conditionality, termination
or termination fees, regulatory efforts or financing in connection with such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries,
offers or proposals, in each case provided by such Person or Group (or any of their Representatives) to the
Company or any member of the Specified Group or of which they become aware (or by the Company or any of its
Representatives to such Person or Group or any of their Representatives) (clauses (ii) through (iv), collectively,
the “Specified Materials”). Thereafter, the Company shall (A) keep Parent reasonably informed, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 36 hours), of each material change to the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals and (B) provide Parent copies of all Specified Materials as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within 36 hours, after their receipt from, or delivery to, such Person or Group or any
of their Representatives, or of the awareness thereof, by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any member of
the Specified Group. A breach by any member of the Specified Group of this Section 5.3(e) shall be deemed to be
a breach by the Company of this Section 5.3(e) as though such action were taken by the Company. After the date
of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not enter into any Contract with any Person that
prohibits or otherwise limits the Company from complying with its obligations in this Section 5.3(e) or Section
5.3(d).
(f) Certain Disclosures. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a customary “stop-
look-and-listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
or from making disclosures to the Company Stockholders pursuant to applicable securities Laws with regard to
the Transactions or an Acquisition Proposal, it being understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to
permit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change other than in accordance with Section 5.3(d) or eliminate or modify the effect that such disclosure would
otherwise have under this Agreement.
5.4 No Control of the Other Party’s Business. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set
forth in this Agreement are not intended to give any Parent Entity, on the one hand, or any Company Entity, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or operations of the other at any
time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms,
conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their own business and
operations.

other hand, shall, to the extent required, use their reasonable best efforts to (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the Mergers as required by
the HSR Act within ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement; and (ii) within fifteen Business

Each of Parent and the Company shall (1) cooperate and coordinate (and shall cause its respective Affiliates to
cooperate and coordinate) with the other in the making of such filings; (2) supply the other (or cause the other to
be supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such filings; (3) supply (or cause to be
supplied) any additional information that may be required or requested by the relevant Governmental
Authorities; and (4) for the HSR Act and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.2(b), take (and cause
their Affiliates to take) all action necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act, in each case as promptly as practicable and in any event
prior to the Termination Date. Each Parent Entity shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates), on the other hand, shall promptly inform the
other of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding the Mergers in connection with such
filings. If a Party or any of its Affiliates receives any comments or a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers pursuant to the FPA or the
HSR Act, then such Party shall make (or cause to be made), as promptly as practicable and after consultation
with the other Parties, an appropriate response to such request; provided, that (x) no Party may stay, toll or
extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement or understanding with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the HSR Act without the permission of the other Parties, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (y) either Party may, with the consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), cause both Parties to take all
reasonable actions required to withdraw the Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the
Mergers as required by the HSR Act and to refile on a date agreed upon between outside counsel for Parent and
the Company.
(b) Avoidance of Impediments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.2(a)
(whether in relation to any Antitrust Law, the FPA, FERC or otherwise) or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
any Parent Entity nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to, and, without the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, agree to, offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), of any or all of the capital stock or other equity or voting
interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products or businesses of any of the Parent
Entities or their respective Affiliates, or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) the termination,
modification, or assignment of existing relationships, joint ventures, Contracts, or obligations of any of the
Parent Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(iii) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of any of the Parent Entities or any of
their respective Affiliates, or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) any other restrictions on the
activities of any of the Parent Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the freedom of action of any of the Parent Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their respective
operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers,
Annex A-48
Table of Contents
assets or rights or interests, or their freedom of action with respect to the assets, properties, or businesses to be
acquired pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall oppose
any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment, decree, injunction or
ruling of any Governmental Authority that could restrain, prevent or delay any required consents applicable to
the Merger, including by defending through litigation any action asserted by any Person in any court or before
any Governmental Authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing properly any adverse
decision or order by any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to enter into any agreement or consent decree
with the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental Authority that is not conditioned on the Closing.
(c) Cooperation. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Parties shall (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Laws, (i) promptly notify the
other Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise
the others of the contents of) any material communication received by such Person from a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Mergers and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to
consider in good faith any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications,
formal notifications, filing, submission or other written communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white
papers, presentations, correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the
Mergers to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties informed with respect to the status of any such
submissions and filings to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and any developments,
meetings or substantive discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including with respect
to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any
waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation
or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under applicable Laws, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger; and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting,
hearing, proceeding or discussions (whether in person, by telephone, by video or otherwise) with or before any
Governmental Authority in respect of the Mergers without giving the other parties reasonable prior notice of
such meeting or substantive discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. However, each Party may designate any non-public or competitively
sensitive information (including trade secrets) provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to “outside
counsel” only and any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the non-public or competitively sensitive
information; provided that each Party may redact any valuation and related information before sharing any
information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside counsel” only basis, and
that the Parties shall not in any event be required to share information that benefits from legal privilege with the
other Parties, even on an “outside counsel” only basis, where this would cause such information to cease to
benefit from legal privilege, or otherwise not be permitted under applicable Law or Contract.
(d) Other Actions. Until the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and (ii) the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b), the Parent Entities shall not, and
shall cause each of their Affiliates not to, enter into, agree to enter into, or consummate any Contracts for an
acquisition by stock purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise, of (A) the equity interests
of any Person that has material operations relating to the development or operation of biogas projects in the
United States or (B) assets or rights of any Person, which assets or rights are related to the development or
operation of biogas projects in the United States, in each case to the extent any such entrance, agreement, or
consummation would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the ability of the Parent Entities to obtain the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section
7.1(b); provided, that this Section 6.2(d) shall not be construed in any way to prevent or restrict any agreement
for an offtake supply arrangement in the ordinary course of business of the Parent Entities or their Affiliates.
6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings.
(a) Proxy Statement. As promptly as practical following the date of this Agreement, the Company
(with the assistance and cooperation of the Parent Entities as reasonably requested by the Company) shall
prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the “Proxy
Statement”) relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (it being agreed that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to do so within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date hereof). Subject to
Section 5.3(d), the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Annex A-49
Table of Contents
(b) Other Required Company Filing. If the Company determines that it is required to file any
document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Mergers pursuant to applicable
Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company Filing”), then the Company
(with the assistance and cooperation of the Parent Entities as reasonably requested by the Company) shall
promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and
NYSE. Except for filings relating to matters referred to in Section 5.3 and that would not constitute a breach of
Section 5.3, the Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC
without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document,
and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent or its respective counsel.
(c) Furnishing Information. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent Entities, on the other
hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to
any Party or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or any
Parent Entity, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement to such filing describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the
appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the
Company Stockholders.
(d) Consultation Prior to Certain Communications. The Company and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Parent Entities and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing
with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case
may be, without first providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written
communication, and each Party shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel.
(e) Notices. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent Entities, on the other hand, shall advise the
other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be;
(ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in
connection therewith. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments received
from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing as promptly as
practicable after its receipt thereof, provided that the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such response, and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel.
(f) Dissemination of Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event more than two (2) Business Days, following
the earlier of (i) confirmation from the SEC, orally or in writing, that it will not review, or that it has completed its
review of, the Proxy Statement or (ii) expiration of the ten-day waiting period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act if the SEC has not informed the Company during such period that it
intends to review, or is reviewing, the Proxy Statement.
6.4 Company Stockholder Meeting.
(a) Call of Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval (the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) as promptly as
practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, including by conducting “broker searches” and
providing notifications to the stock exchange in a timely manner that does not delay the Company Stockholder
Meeting. Without limiting the
Annex A-50
Table of Contents
foregoing, the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be scheduled for a date that is more than
thirty (30) calendar days following the initial mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders. Without the prior consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other
than matters of procedure, including adjournment or postponement thereof, and matters required by Law to be
voted on by the Company Stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement, including a “Say-on-
Golden-Parachute” vote) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3(d) and unless there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 5.3(d), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; provided that any Company Board
Recommendation Change shall not relieve the Company from its obligations to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis and
upon Parent’s written request regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the mailing of the
definitive Proxy Statement.
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall not adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), provided that the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting (i) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; (ii) if
there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by
proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting
(provided that, without the prior written consent of Parent, all such postponements and adjournments under
clause (i) or this clause (ii) may not be cumulatively to a date that is later than the earlier of (A) 45 days following
the originally scheduled date of the Company Stockholder Meeting and (B) the date that is three Business Days
prior to the Termination Date); (iii) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting by a specific Order or a specific request from the SEC or its staff (provided that, without the prior
consent of Parent, each such postponement or adjournment under this clause (iii) may be for no more than the
amount of time specified in such Order or request); or (iv) if the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by applicable Law to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made available
to the Company Stockholders (including, if in compliance with Section 5.3(d), in connection with any Company
Board Recommendation Change), provided that, without the prior written consent of Parent, no individual
postponement and adjournment under this clause (iv) may be for more than ten Business Days and, in any
event, may not be to a date that is later than three Business Days prior to the Termination Date. In no event will
the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable Law.
6.5 Anti-Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take reasonable actions within
their power to ensure that no “anti-takeover” statute or similar statute or regulation (including Section 203 of the
DGCL) is or becomes applicable to any of the Mergers or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Voting Agreements or the Warrant Agreement Amendment; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Voting Agreements or the Warrant Agreement Amendment, take reasonable actions within their
power to ensure that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting
Agreements and the Warrant Agreement Amendment may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting Agreements
and the Warrant Agreement Amendment.
6.6 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the
Effective Time, the Company shall, subject to restrictions or limitations as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19
Measures, afford Parent reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance request, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company, except that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information;
(b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a
Contract to which
Annex A-51
Table of Contents
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is otherwise
bound would cause a breach or a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate
the rights pursuant to such Contract; or (d) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets (including
source code) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any third Persons, provided that, in each case, the
Company shall (A) give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and (B)
use its reasonable best efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any third party to provide such access,
document or information and (2) design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Parent and
its Representatives to evaluate any such information (or as much of it as possible) without triggering any of the
foregoing clauses (a) through (d). Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall be construed to require the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions
or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.6 shall
be conducted in a manner that (i) does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by officers, employees and other authorized representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of their normal duties or (ii) create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the
Company’s reasonable safety and security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to
perform invasive or subsurface testing or any sampling, monitoring or analysis of soil, groundwater, building
materials, indoor or ambient air, or other environmental media. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.6
must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another person designated in writing by the
Company.
6.7 Section 16(b) Exemption. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take all such
actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) (including the disposition, cancellation, or deemed
disposition and cancellation of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs or Company PSUs) in connection with
the Mergers by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company, to be exempt pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
6.8 Company Indebtedness. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
deliver notices of prepayment and notices of termination of commitments (including any certifications or
calculations to be provided therewith), in each case, only to the extent such notices of prepayment and notices
of termination of commitments are not prohibited under the relevant documents from being conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing, with respect to the Company Credit Agreement and the Assai Notes, in each case
relating to the prepayment in full of outstanding Indebtedness under the Company Credit Agreement and the
Assai Notes and any other Payoff Indebtedness at the Closing, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices relating to the unwinding and settlement by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time of all interest rate swaps relating to the outstanding Indebtedness under the Company
Credit Agreement and the Assai Notes and any other Payoff Indebtedness; provided that, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to deliver any notice that is not expressly conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to (a) obtain and deliver
to Parent prior to the Closing payoff letters in customary form from the lenders (or their applicable
representative) with respect to the Company Credit Agreement (or any similar Payoff Indebtedness) stating the
amounts required to pay in full all Indebtedness thereunder at the Closing, (b) obtain and deliver to Parent
documents in customary form acknowledging the termination of obligations and release of Liens related to the
Assai Notes (or any similar Payoff Indebtedness) from the collateral agent with respect thereto upon the payoff
of the Assai Notes (or such Payoff Indebtedness, as applicable) and (c) obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the
Closing such documentation from the counterparties to such interest rate swaps acknowledging the unwinding
and settlement of such swaps without further liability on the part of the Company and its Subsidiaries subject to
their payment on the Closing Date of the amounts specified therein. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent in the payoff or prepayment in full, as applicable, of all Company Indebtedness and
Payoff Indebtedness as of the Effective Time, the termination of the Company Credit Agreement, the Assai
Notes and all other Payoff Indebtedness as of the Effective Time and the release any related Liens, guaranties
and other credit support upon the occurrence of such payoff or prepayment and the unwinding and settlement in
full of such interest rate swaps as of the Effective Time (provided that no such notice of prepayment, payoff or
prepayment shall be required that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to
Parent at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date draft payoff letters, termination acknowledgments,
release documentation and unwind and settlement documentation, and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable comments thereto by Parent or its counsel.

6.9 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries to), subject to applicable Law, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements, existing on the
date hereof and true and complete copies of which have been made available to Parent, between the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or
employees, on the other hand (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors and administrators, a
“Contractually Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Contractually Indemnified Persons”) with respect to
acts or omissions by a Contractually Indemnified Person occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entities and their
Subsidiaries to), subject to applicable Law, cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses with regard to acts or omissions by Indemnified Persons occurring at or prior to the Effective Time that
are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in
the Organizational Documents of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company, as the case may be, as of
the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.9(a),
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entities and their
Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless, subject to and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
each current or former director and officer (and any Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (each such Person, together with such Person’s heirs,
executors and administrators, a “Indemnified Person”) from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises,
directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) any action or omission
(including the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions) and alleged action or omission, occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director or officer, trustee or fiduciary of another
Person), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(b), then the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving Entities shall advance all reasonable
fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified
Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding; provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced shall
provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates shall settle or otherwise compromise, or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification is being sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all
liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing thereto
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(c) D&O Insurance. Parent (or its designated Affiliate) shall purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with
respect to the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, to be effective as of the Effective
Date, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed 300% of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum
Premium”), and Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for a period of no less
than six years after the Effective Time. Prior to purchasing such “tail policy”, Parent shall allow the Company to
review the terms of such “tail” policy
Annex A-53
Table of Contents
and shall consider in good faith any comments made by the Company. If Parent (or its designated Affiliate) are
unable to obtain the “tail” policy for an aggregate cost less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, Parent (or its
Affiliate) shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for a premium equal to the Maximum
Premium.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
Surviving Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall assume all of
the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.9.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.9 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Contractually Indemnified Person or any
Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a beneficiary pursuant to the “tail” policy referred to in
Section 6.9(c) (and their respective successors, heirs and representatives), the “Other Indemnified Persons”)
without the prior written consent of such affected Person. Each of the Contractually Indemnified Persons, the
Indemnified Persons or Other Indemnified Persons are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9,
with full rights of enforcement of this Section 6.9 as if a Party. The Parties and the Surviving Entities agree that
the rights of the Contractually Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Persons and Other Indemnified Persons
pursuant to this Section 6.9 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons
may have, subject to applicable Law, pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the Organizational Documents of
the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be construed to, release, waive
or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to
such policies or agreements.
6.10 Employee Matters.
(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change in control” (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time and
Parent will interpret the provisions of each of the Employee Plans in good faith and, in any event, substantially
consistent with the manner in which the applicable Employee Plan has been interpreted in the past (unless
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law).
(b) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) assume and honor all of the Employee Plans, including
Contracts with Company Service Providers (including Contracts entered into after the date hereof) in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Employment; Benefits. For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time (the
“Continuation Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee, for so long
as such Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries) (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than that
applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) cash target incentive
opportunities (including bonus and commission opportunities, but excluding any one-time, special or non-
recurring bonuses and the ability to receive bonuses in the form of Company Common Stock (except for annual
bonuses in respect of fiscal year 2022)), allowances or other payments and equity or equity-based target
incentive opportunities (excluding any one-time, special or non-recurring equity or equity-based opportunities)
and all other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for such
Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
during the Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) provide severance benefits and payments to eligible employees as set forth in Section 6.10(c) of

(d) New Plans. With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or
agreement that is made available to any Continuing Employee at or within a period of twelve months
commencing immediately after the Effective Time (each such plan, a “New Plan”), the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) use reasonable
best efforts to the extent permitted by the terms of each New Plan and applicable Law to cause to be granted to
each Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance entitlement or termination pay), except that such
recognition of service will not apply for (i) purposes of any equity or equity-based plans (including any
entitlement to equity acceleration in connection with retirement), (ii) purposes of any plan that provides retiree
welfare benefits, (iii) purposes of benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension
plan or plan providing post-retirement pension plan benefits, (iv) to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits for the same period of service or (v) for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement
(A) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service
or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) use reasonable best efforts to the extent permitted
by the terms of each New Plan and applicable Law so that (1) each Continuing Employee will be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant
to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding existing benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is available to any Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each such plan, an “Old Plan”); (2) for purposes of each New Plan providing life insurance,
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan
to be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents, unless and to the extent the
individual, immediately prior to entry in such plan, was subject to such conditions under the comparable Old
Plan; (3) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits any eligible
expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins, but only to the extent there is any overlap between the plan year of the Old Plan and corresponding New
Plan, to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employees and their covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (4) for
purposes of each New Plan that is a flexible spending account plan, such New Plans credit the accounts of the
Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending account plan with any unused
balances in the account of such Continuing Employees under the Old Plan that is a flexible spending account
plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and will be subject to
the terms and conditions of the Company’s vacation or paid time off policies in effect as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be solely responsible for any and all obligations
under Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all “M&A qualified beneficiaries” as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.
(e) Company Incentive Plans. With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans
(each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
pay to each Continuing Employee who remains employed with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates through the end of such fiscal year, at the same time or times that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their applicable Affiliate pays annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other similarly
situated employees thereof, but in no event later than March 15 immediately after the end of such fiscal year, a
bonus for such fiscal year (the “Annual Bonus”) that is equal to the Annual Bonus that such Continuing
Employee is entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan based on actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year (as determined after giving appropriate
effect to the Transactions). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing and unless otherwise
provided in an applicable Employee Plan, if a Continuing Employee’s employment is terminated without “Cause”
or due to the Continuing Employee’s resignation with “Good Reason” (as each term is defined in Section 6.10(e)
of the Company Disclosure Letter) before payment of the Annual Bonus (each, a “Qualifying Termination”), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) pay to such Continuing Employee, no later than ten (10) days
Annex A-55
Table of Contents
following the date of such Qualifying Termination, a pro-rated portion of the target Annual Bonus that such
Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan for such
fiscal year if such Continuing Employee had remained employed, with such proration based on the relative
portion of the fiscal year during which such Continuing Employee was employed with the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.
(f) Company Service Provider Communications. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in
good faith any comments on, any formal or informal written material communication (including any electronic
communication) and (y) consult with Parent prior to any formal or informal oral material communication (e.g.,
town halls), in each case, by the Company regarding the Transactions or post-Closing employee benefit plans
and compensation in connection with this Agreement that is intended for broad-based and general distribution
to Company Service Providers. In each case, the Company will provide to Parent the final copy or script, as
applicable, of each such communication distributed or made to Company Service Providers. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.10(f), the Company may issue communications that are consistent with
(i) communications previously approved by Parent or specifically contemplated by this Agreement (without any
material deviations) or (ii) prior press releases, public announcements, public statements or other public
disclosures made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Agreement; provided, however, that in no
event shall any communications made or distributed by the Company to Company Service Providers contemplate
or promise actions that are prohibited by Section 5.2. Following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in good faith for the purpose of preparing for the on-boarding and transition of Continuing
Employees, including the Company providing information related to such Continuing Employees’ roles,
compensation and benefits as reasonably requested by Parent.
(g) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, this Section 6.10 will not be deemed to: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, to terminate any
Continuing Employee; (ii) amend any Employee Plan; provided, that, nothing in this Section 6.10 will prohibit
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Employee Plans, subject to and in
accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law; or (iii) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other Person (other
than the Parties).
6.11 Obligations of Merger Sub and Opco Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
Merger Sub, Opco Merger Sub and the Surviving Entities to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. The Parent Entities shall be jointly and severally liable for the failure by any of them to perform and
discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement, and the
Company Entities shall be jointly and severally liable for the failure by any of them to perform and discharge any
of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
6.12 Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press releases with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be in the form reasonably agreed to by the Parties, and following such initial press releases, the
Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Mergers and shall consider
in good faith the comments of the other with respect thereto and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice as is
feasible); provided, that such consultation shall not apply with respect to communications (including
communications directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners, vendors or stockholders) that are
consistent with public statements previously made in accordance with this Section 6.12; provided, further, that
the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.12 shall not apply to (i) the extent relating to matters referred to in
Section 5.3(d) and made in compliance therewith or (ii) in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the Mergers.
6.13 Transaction Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to
provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation to which the Company, any of its Affiliates or any
of their respective current or former directors, officers, advisors or employees is a defendant (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
Annex A-56
Table of Contents
status thereof. The Company will (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any such Transaction Litigation; and (b) reasonably consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any such Transaction Litigation, including by reasonably
consulting with Parent in advance of, and providing copies to Parent and an opportunity to comment in advance
of, filings, submissions, written communications or appearances in any such Transaction Litigation and
considering in good faith the comments and advice of Parent. The Company may not compromise or settle, or
offer, propose or agree to compromise or settle, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto
in advance in writing. The Company shall not commence any Transaction Litigation as a plaintiff without the
prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Transaction Litigation with a Governmental
Authority arising under Antitrust Laws or the FPA shall be governed by Section 6.2, rather than this Section
6.13.
6.14 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to applicable Law and the rules
and regulations of NYSE to cause (a) the delisting of the Company Common Stock from NYSE as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.
6.15 Parent Vote. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a
written consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
6.16 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (a) of any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or the Warrant Agreement Amendment, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent, taken as a whole, or (b) if it obtains
knowledge of any breach by such Party of its representations, warranties and covenants hereunder that is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or (b) or Sections 7.3(a) or (b) not
being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.16 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior
to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party. The
Company shall also (i) give Parent prompt notice of any material safety or operational incident, casualty or other
similar occurrence relating to any of the Company’s projects and, upon Parent’s written request, shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status of the Company’s projects and the achievement of commercial
operation with respect to any Company project and (ii) notify Parent as soon as practical of any violation (or
notice of violation) of Environmental Laws or employee health and safety laws, except where (A) the maximum
exposure under such notice of violation is not reasonably expected to exceed $10,000 in the aggregate per such
notice of violation or (B) there is no impact to personal or process safety. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 6.16, in and of itself, shall
not cause any of the conditions to the Mergers to fail to be satisfied or give rise to any right of Parent to
terminate this Agreement, and any Party’s failure to comply with this Section 6.16 will not be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether any conditions set forth in Article VII to consummate the Mergers have
been satisfied.
6.17 Tax Matters.
(a) Additional Cooperation on Tax Matters. From and after the Closing, Parent, the Company, Opco
and the Person designated as the “Unitholder Representative” pursuant to the Unitholder Representative
Engagement Letter (the “Unitholder Representative”) shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, in each case to the extent such cooperation is
reasonably related to the preparation of Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall include the provision of estimates
of taxable income to the unitholders of Opco for the taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing
Date to the extent reasonably available to Parent and necessary to allow such unitholders to make estimated tax
payments in respect of their ownership of Opco for such period and the retention and (upon the other Party’s
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding. The Unitholder Representative, on behalf of the members of Opco, is intended to
be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.17, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party.
Annex A-57
Table of Contents
(b) Preparation of Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
income Tax Returns of Opco and its Subsidiaries the income shown on which is reflected on the Tax Returns of
any member of Opco or any of its direct or indirect equityholders on a “pass-through” basis for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods and Straddle Periods that are due after the Closing (each, a “Pass-Through Income
Tax Return”). Each Pass-Through Income Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice of
Opco and its Subsidiaries, unless otherwise required by Law or this Agreement, and shall reflect any Transaction
Tax Deductions as deductions in the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by applicable Law. No later
than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any Pass-Through Income Tax Return, Parent shall provide to the
Unitholder Representative a draft of such Pass-Through Income Tax Return for the Unitholder Representative’s
review and comment, and Parent shall consider any reasonable comments in good faith.
(c) Opco Push-Out Election. In the event an audit of Opco by the IRS with respect to any taxable
year in which Section 6221 through 6234 of the Code, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, is
effective and results in a notice of final partnership adjustment, the Unitholder Representative shall reasonably
cooperate to the extent requested by Parent to cause Opco and the “partnership representative” (as described in
Section 6223 of the Code) of Opco (and the “designated individual” (as described in Treasury Regulations
Section 301.6223-1) of Opco, as applicable), to make a timely election under Section 6226(a) of the Code to treat a
“partnership adjustment” as an adjustment to be taken into account by each applicable holder (or former holder)
of Opco Units in accordance with Section 6226(b) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state and
local Law), in each case to the extent such election is available.
(d) Audits of Tax Returns. Parent shall notify the Unitholder Representative promptly upon becoming
aware of any audit or examination regarding any Pass-Through Income Tax Return and for which the Specified
Opco Holders would be liable for the related Tax, including under Section 6.17(c) (each, a “Tax Audit”). Parent
shall have the right to control each Tax Audit; provided, however, that (i) the Unitholder Representative will
have the right to participate in any such Tax Audit, provided that the cost and expense of such third-party shall
be split proportionate to the ownership interests of the Company and the Specified Opco Holders in Opco
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) Parent shall keep the Unitholder Representative reasonably notified
regarding the progress of such Tax Audit, and (iii) to the extent any proposed settlement or compromise of a Tax
Audit would result in a Tax liability of the Specified Opco Holders, Parent shall not settle or compromise such Tax
Audit without the prior written consent of the Unitholder Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).
(e) No Amendments or Restatements. Except where an action described in this Section 6.17(e) would
not reasonably be expected to increase the Tax liability of any Specified Opco Holder, Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company, Opco and their respective Subsidiaries) shall not (i) without the prior written consent of
the Unitholder Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (A) file any
restatement or amendment of, or modification to any Tax Return for Opco or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any Pass-Through Income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) make or change any Tax election or
accounting method for or with respect to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period of Opco or any of its Subsidiaries, including in connection with any audit or examination with respect to
any Pass-Through Income Tax Return, other than as provided under Section 6.17(c), (C) make any election under
Section 336 or 338 of the Code with respect to Opco or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transactions, (D) take any action with respect to Taxes that would adversely and disproportionately affect the
Specified Opco Holders or (E) extend or waive any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of
any Tax or deficiency related to a Pass-Through Income Tax Return (other than if requested by a taxing authority
in connection with a Tax audit or examination) and (ii) without providing reasonable notice to the Unitholder
Representative, (A) extend or waive any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or
deficiency related to a Pass-Through Income Tax Return if requested by a taxing authority in connection with a
Tax audit or examination or (B) voluntarily approach any Taxing Governmental Authority or initiate any
“voluntary disclosure” with respect to any Tax matter that would reasonably be expected to affect the Specified
Opco Holders.
(f) Purchase Price Allocation. The consideration (including amounts treated as consideration for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes) payable to the holders of Opco Units in respect of their Opco Units pursuant
to this Agreement shall be allocated among the assets of Opco in accordance with the principles of Section 755
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Unitholder Representative for its review a draft allocation statement (the “Allocation
Statement”), which shall include a description of the amount of consideration allocated to property described in
Section 751(a)
Annex A-58
Table of Contents
of the Code, and Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments to the Allocation Statement
received by the Unitholder Representative within 30 days of receipt thereof. The parties (i) shall file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the final Allocation Statement and (ii) shall not take any
position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the final Allocation Statement, except, in each case, as
required by applicable Law.

(a) Manner of Termination. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 (other than
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties specifying the
provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated.
(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be
effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect without liability of any Party (or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or
representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except that this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Article IX shall each survive the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no termination of this Agreement (or payment of any Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee) will relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement by such Party prior to termination. In the event that the Company has received the Parent
Termination Fee and is otherwise entitled to monetary damages on account of fraud or Willful and Material
Breach of this Agreement by Parent in an amount in excess of such Parent Termination Fee, then the amount of
the Parent Termination Fee shall be credited and offset against the amount of such damages. In the event that
Parent has received the Company Termination Fee and is otherwise entitled to monetary damages on account of
fraud or Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement by any of the Company Entities in an amount in excess of
such Company Termination Fee, then the amount of the Company Termination Fee shall be credited and offset
against the amount of such damages. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will affect
the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, which rights, obligations and
agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

satisfied at the Closing, such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur), then Parent

Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Party (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that if
the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement
that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval.

of this Section 8.5). Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

hereunder, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other Parties. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party

without the consent required by this Section 9.3 is null and void.
9.4 Confidentiality. The Parties hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed the Amended and Restated Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated August 8, 2022 (the
“Confidentiality Agreement”), that shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; provided
that the standstill undertaking by Parent contained therein shall be deemed to have expired on the date hereof.
Each of the Parent Entities and their respective representatives shall hold and treat all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to the Parent Entities or
their respective representatives in connection with the Mergers in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each Parent Entity agrees to be bound by, and to cause their

this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the

Annex A-65
Table of Contents
(b) Specific Performance.
(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur if the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions; (ii) the
Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (iii) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not
intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or the Parent Entities, on the
other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and shall not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief; and (iv) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Mergers and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require or request the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. The Parties further agree that (x) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 9.8, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 9.8 shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party’s right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.8 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.8 or anything set forth in this Section 9.8 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available then or thereafter (it being understood that, once this Agreement is validly terminated,
specific performance may be sought only with respect to those provisions of this Agreement that survive
termination as set forth in Section 8.2(b)). This Section 9.8(b) is not intended and shall not be construed to limit
in any way the provisions of Section 8.3(e). While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with this Section 9.8(b) and the payment of the Company Termination Fee or
the Parent Termination Fee as applicable, in no event shall the Company or Parent be entitled to receive both the
grant of specific performance that results in the Closing to occur, on the one hand, and the Company Termination
Fee or the Parent Termination Fee (as applicable) or monetary damages, on the other hand.
9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings, causes of action, claims or counterclaims
(whether based on contract, tort, statute or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the actions of any Party in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof (including any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws, including any statutes of limitations, of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction.
(a) General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts)
in any Legal Proceeding based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, for and on
behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may
be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
other state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in any dispute or controversy
based on, arises out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction; (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees
that any Legal Proceeding based on, arising in
Annex A-66

connection with or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought, tried and determined only in
the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding based on,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each
of the Parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Person’s respective address set forth in Section 9.2
shall be effective service of process for any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts with respect to any matters
to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each Party
agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO, BASED ON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, BASED
ON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND
(iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto.
9.13 Company Disclosure Letter References. The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable,
a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, as
applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of Article III or Article
V of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and warranties of the Company that are set forth in
Article III of this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure.
9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”),
shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may
raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Archaea Energy Inc. (“Archaea”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of October 16, 2022 (the “Agreement”), among Archaea, BP Products North America Inc. (“Parent”),
Condor RTM Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), Condor RTM LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Opco Merger Sub”) and LFG Acquisition Holdings LLC (“Opco”), pursuant to which,
among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into Archaea (the “Merger”) and each outstanding share of
Class A common stock (other than Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) or Dissenting Shares
(as defined in the Agreement)), par value $0.0001 per share, of Archaea (“Archaea Class A Common Stock”) will
be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Archaea Class
A Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in
the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
     
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Archaea;
(ii)
    
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of Archaea furnished to or discussed with us by the management of Archaea,
including certain financial forecasts relating to Archaea prepared by the management of Archaea
(such forecasts, the “Archaea Forecasts”);
(iii)
   
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Archaea
with members of senior management of Archaea;
(iv)
   
reviewed the trading history for Archaea Class A Common Stock and a comparison of that trading
history with the trading histories of other companies we deemed relevant;
(v)
    
compared certain financial and stock market information of Archaea with similar information of other
companies we deemed relevant;
(vi)
   
considered the results of our efforts on behalf of Archaea to solicit, at the direction of Archaea,
indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible
acquisition of Archaea;
(vii)  reviewed a draft, dated October 16, 2022, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
(viii) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Archaea Energy Inc. (“Archaea”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of October 16, 2022 (the “Agreement”), among Archaea, BP Products North America Inc. (“Parent”),
Condor RTM Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), Condor RTM LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Opco Merger Sub”) and LFG Acquisition Holdings LLC (“Opco”), pursuant to which,
among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into Archaea (the “Merger”) and each outstanding share of
Class A common stock (other than Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) or Dissenting Shares
(as defined in the Agreement)), par value $0.0001 per share, of Archaea (“Archaea Class A Common Stock”) will
be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Archaea Class
A Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in
the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
     
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Archaea;
(ii)
    
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of Archaea furnished to or discussed with us by the management of Archaea,
including certain financial forecasts relating to Archaea prepared by the management of Archaea
(such forecasts, the “Archaea Forecasts”);
(iii)
   
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Archaea
with members of senior management of Archaea;
(iv)
   
reviewed the trading history for Archaea Class A Common Stock and a comparison of that trading
history with the trading histories of other companies we deemed relevant;
(v)
    
compared certain financial and stock market information of Archaea with similar information of other
companies we deemed relevant;
(vi)
   
considered the results of our efforts on behalf of Archaea to solicit, at the direction of Archaea,
indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible
acquisition of Archaea;
(vii)  reviewed a draft, dated October 16, 2022, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
(viii) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we
deemed appropriate.
Annex B-1Table of Contents
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the management of Archaea that it is
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in
any material respect. With respect to the Archaea Forecasts, we have been advised by Archaea, and have
assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
good faith judgments of the management of Archaea as to the future financial performance of Archaea. We have
not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Archaea, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Archaea. We
have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of Archaea, Parent or any other entity under any state, federal or
other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at the direction of Archaea,
that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of
any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or
condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would
have an adverse effect on Archaea or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We have also assumed, at the
direction of Archaea, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft
Agreement reviewed by us.
We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the
Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the
Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in
connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Consideration to be received by holders of Archaea Class A Common Stock (other than
Owned Company Shares) and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in
connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any
party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the
amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any
party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion
or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that
might be available to Archaea or in which Archaea might engage or as to the underlying business decision of
Archaea to proceed with or effect the Merger. We are also not expressing any view or opinion with respect to,
and we have relied, with your consent, upon the assessments of Archaea and its representatives regarding,
legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Archaea or the Merger (including the
contemplated benefits thereof), as to which matters we understand that Archaea obtained such advice as it
deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how
any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter.
We have acted as financial advisor to Archaea in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which is payable upon delivery of this opinion and a significant portion of which is
contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Archaea has agreed to reimburse our expenses and
indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,
commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as
well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and
financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may invest on a
principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions,
finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other securities or financial
instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Archaea, Parent and certain of their
respective affiliates.

such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. As you are aware,
the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no opinion or
view as to any potential effects of such volatility on Archaea, Parent or the Merger. It should be understood that
subsequent developments may affect this opinion, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, we
are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Archaea
Class A Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
Very truly yours,
