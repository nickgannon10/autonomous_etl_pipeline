Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
The special meeting of Meritor’s shareholders (the “special meeting”) will be held virtually via the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTOR2022SM on May 26, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time.
As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, the special meeting will be held solely by means
of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting online and to vote your
shares electronically at the special meeting by visiting the special meeting website.
Purposes of the Special Meeting
At the special meeting, Meritor shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 21, 2022 (as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub (the “Merger Proposal”);
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable
to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, the value of which is disclosed
in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Meritor’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” (the “Compensation Proposal”); and
•
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger
Proposal or in the absence of a quorum (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Meritor shareholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. If our shareholders fail to approve
the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. For more information, see the sections of this proxy statement
entitled “The Special Meeting” and “The Merger Agreement.”
No matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the special meeting.
Meritor’s board of directors (the “Meritor Board”) has unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the
Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and determined that the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders. The Meritor Board has
unanimously directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for their
consideration at the special meeting and recommends that the Company’s shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger
Proposal and “FOR” the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
The holders of record of outstanding shares of Meritor common stock, par value $1.00 per share (“Common Stock”),
as of the close of business on April 11, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of
and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 70,852,942 shares of Common
Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence at the special meeting, virtually or represented by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the
shares of Common Stock entitled to be cast on any matter to be acted on at the special meeting will constitute a
quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. If a
quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date.
An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either virtually or by proxy, but abstains from voting.
Abstentions will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If your shares
are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals,
and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of
business at the special meeting.
2TABLE OF CONTENTS
Required Vote
Each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on
each of the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.
For the Company to complete the Merger, a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast to approve the Merger
Agreement must vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. An abstention with respect to the Merger Proposal, or a failure to
vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares
held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
Approval of each of (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that
vote thereon, but is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. An abstention with respect to either proposal or
a failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker,
bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum
is present.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
approximately 1,193,331 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 1.7% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Proxies; Revocation
Any Meritor shareholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone or over
the Internet, by returning the enclosed proxy card, or by attending the special meeting virtually and voting
electronically. If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you
should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee.
Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by submitting a properly executed, later-dated proxy
through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at our
headquarters, 2135 West Maple Road, Troy, Michigan 48084-7186, or by attending the special meeting virtually and
voting electronically.",9,10

You will be asked to consider and vote upon the Merger Proposal. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The Merger Agreement
provides, among other things, that at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger.
In the Merger, each share of Common Stock (excluding Canceled Shares and Converted Shares) will cease to be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive $36.50 per share in cash,
without interest, subject to applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”), upon surrender of certificates
or book-entry shares.
Upon completion of the Merger, the Company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, the Common Stock will no
longer be publicly traded and the Company’s existing shareholders will cease to have any ownership interest in the
Company. The Company will therefore become a privately held company, wholly owned by Parent.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding Meritor
equity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:
•
each share of Meritor restricted common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, with each holder of such shares receiving the
same Merger Consideration as all other outstanding shareholders of Common Stock at the Effective Time;
•
each Meritor restricted stock unit award (a “Meritor RSU Award”) will be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Common Stock subject to such Meritor RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
“Converted RSU Award”), subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Meritor RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all service-based vesting conditions;
provided that any accelerated vesting applicable to such Meritor RSU Award in the event of a qualifying
termination of employment occurring after the closing date shall apply for the remaining term of such
Converted RSU Award; and
•
each Meritor performance-based restricted stock unit award (a “Meritor PSU Award”) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) scheduled to vest on or prior to September 30, 2024 will fully
vest and be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock subject to such Meritor PSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable taxes and (ii) scheduled to vest after September
30, 2024 will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock subject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a “Converted PSU Award”), subject to the same terms and conditions as applied
to the corresponding Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all service-
based vesting conditions; provided that any accelerated vesting applicable to such Meritor PSU Award in
the event of a qualifying termination of employment occurring after the closing date shall apply for the
remaining term of such Converted PSU Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to a Meritor PSU Award with a performance period that is incomplete (or that is
complete but for which performance is not determinable due to the unavailability of the required data for
relative measures) as of the Effective Time will be determined by deeming the performance goals applicable
to such Meritor PSU Award to be achieved at the target level of performance.
In the case of any share of Meritor restricted common stock, Meritor RSU Award or Meritor PSU Award (collectively,
the “Meritor Equity Awards”) that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, all payments with respect to such Meritor
Equity Award shall be made in accordance with and at the earliest time as is consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code, and may otherwise be treated in an alternate method to the extent required by law or
agreed by the parties.

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated December 17, 2021, Meritor retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in
connection with the proposed Merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger.
Meritor decided to engage J.P. Morgan due to, among other things, its extensive experience in Meritor’s industry, its
qualifications and its deep expertise in the matters that were to be considered by the Meritor Board.
At the meeting of the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Meritor Board
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications
set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed
Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its February 21, 2022 oral
opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Meritor Board, dated February 21, 2022, that, as of such date, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such shareholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated February 21, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Meritor’s shareholders are urged to
read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Meritor Board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the
consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the Merger and did
5TABLE OF CONTENTS
not address any other aspect of the Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness
committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Meritor as to
how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.

In considering the recommendation of the Meritor Board to vote in favor of the approval of the Merger Proposal,
Meritor shareholders should be aware that Meritor’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meritor shareholders generally. The Meritor Board was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger
Agreement, in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the
Merger, and in recommending to Meritor shareholders that the Merger Proposal be approved.",13,13

As of April 18, 2022, three lawsuits have been filed by purported Meritor shareholders in connection with the Merger
and one demand letter has been sent. The complaints and demand letter generally allege that the preliminary proxy
statement filed by Meritor in connection with the Merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs generally seek, among
other things, to enjoin Meritor from consummating the Merger, or in the alternative, rescission of the Merger and/or
compensatory damages, as well as attorney’s fees. For a more detailed description of such litigation relating to the
Merger, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger.” Meritor
believes that the allegations in the complaints and demand letter are without merit. Additional lawsuits and demand
letters arising out of the Merger may also be filed or sent in the future.

representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry,
proposal or offer or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or

participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any information for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than in response to an unsolicited bona fide inquiry that did
not arise from a material breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations, solely for the purpose of obtaining
clarification from the person making such Company Takeover Proposal of the terms of such Company Takeover

Generally, the Meritor Board may not effect a Change of Recommendation.
However, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Merger Agreement permits the Meritor Board
to, in response to an unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal received by the Company after the date of the Merger

advisor, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
•
the Company provides prior written notice to Parent, at least four business days in advance, that it intends
to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Company
Superior Proposal, which notice specifies the identity of the person making such proposal and a summary
of the material terms thereof and includes a copy of the proposed Company Superior Proposal and the
proposed acquisition agreement with respect thereto;
•
during the four business day period following the date on which notice was received (or with an additional
two business day extension, in the event of any change to (i) the financial terms or (ii) other material terms
of such Company Superior Proposal), the Company and its representatives negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as Parent may
propose; and
•
upon the conclusion of the applicable notice and negotiation period, the Meritor Board consider in good
faith any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and determine,
after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the Company
Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that a failure to take the
contemplated actions would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
In addition, the Meritor Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation (prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval) in response to an Intervening Event if the Meritor Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to a four business day
negotiation period with Parent.

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting
and the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all of the

Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
On February 21, 2022, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, providing for the acquisition of the
Company by Parent for a price of $36.50 per share in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax
withholding. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Meritor
Board in favor of the Merger Proposal and to approve the other related proposals to be voted on at the special
meeting.
Q:
As a shareholder of Meritor, what will I receive in the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed, you will receive $36.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax
withholding, for each outstanding share of Common Stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will be held virtually via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTOR2022SM
on May 26, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
Only holders of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on April 11, 2022, the record date for the
special meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their shares at the special meeting. Each
share of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote at the special meeting.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?
A:
At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and approve the following proposals:
•
the Merger Proposal;
•
the Compensation Proposal; and
•
the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How do I attend the special meeting?
A:
As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, the special meeting will be held solely by
means of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting online and
to vote your shares electronically at the special meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTOR2022SM. If you hold your shares in “street name,” and you also
wish to be able to vote at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from your bank or
broker.
Q:
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
The presence, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled
to be cast on any matter to be acted on at the special meeting is necessary to have a quorum. If a quorum is not
present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a
quorum is obtained.
10TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of the close of business on April 11, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, there were 70,852,942
shares of Common Stock outstanding.
If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the
proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the
special meeting.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the
nominee how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect
to any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.
Q:
What vote of Meritor shareholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?
A:
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement.
An abstention with respect to the Merger Proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including
a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
Q:
What vote of Meritor shareholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the special
meeting?
A:
Each of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that vote
thereon.
An abstention with respect to either proposal or a failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your
shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your
behalf), will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
How does the Meritor Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Meritor Board unanimously recommends that Meritor shareholders vote:
•
“FOR” the Merger Proposal;
•
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and
•
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Meritor Board considered in determining to recommend in favor of the
approval of the Merger Proposal, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Meritor Board.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Meritor
Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive
officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meritor shareholders
generally. For a discussion of these interests, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger -
Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:
How many shares of Common Stock may Meritor’s directors and officers vote?
A:
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
approximately 1,193,331 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 1.7% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Q:
Am I entitled to dissenters’ rights under the IBCL?
A:
No, under Indiana law, holders of Common Stock are not entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the
Merger.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger by the end of calendar year 2022.
However, completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
1
1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
completion of the Merger, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the approval of Meritor’s
shareholders, which are described in this proxy statement, and we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to
the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not approved by the Company’s shareholders, or if the Merger is not completed for
any other reason, the Company’s shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock in
connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of Common Stock
will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the NYSE. In the event
that either Meritor or Parent terminates the Merger Agreement, then, in certain specified circumstances, Meritor
may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, or Parent may be required to pay Meritor the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable. For more information, see the sections of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee” and “The Merger Agreement - Parent Termination Fee.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the Compensation Proposal? What will happen if
shareholders do not approve this proposal?
A:
The inclusion of the Compensation Proposal is required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”); however, the approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the
Merger and the vote on the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote by shareholders and will not be binding
on the Company or Parent. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company’s shareholders and the Merger
is completed, the Merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company’s named executive officers in
accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the Company’s
shareholders fail to approve this Compensation Proposal.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of shares of Common Stock?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share represents a 48% premium to the closing price of the Common
Stock as of February 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?
A:
We urge you to read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is important,
regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock you own.
Voting at the Special Meeting
Shareholders of record will be able to attend the special meeting virtually and vote electronically via the special
meeting website. If you are not a shareholder of record but instead hold your shares of Common Stock in “street
name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your
broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote at the special meeting. You will be able to attend the
special meeting online and to vote your shares electronically at the special meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTOR2022SM.
It is not necessary to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares of Common Stock. To ensure that
your shares of Common Stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting
instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting virtually.
Attending the special meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
You can ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy
via:
•
mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope;
12
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
telephone, by using the toll-free number 1-800-690-6903; or
•
the Internet, at www.proxyvote.com.
The telephone and Internet voting facilities for shareholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
May 25, 2022.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted
“FOR” (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.
We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the special meeting.
A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the Merger
Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the
directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in 401(k) Plan Account
If you hold shares in a Meritor 401(k) plan account, you should follow the directions provided by the plan
administrator or plan trustee regarding how to instruct the plan trustee how to vote your shares.
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a shareholder of
record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company in writing, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at
our headquarters, 2135 West Maple Road, Troy, Michigan 48084-7186, or by submitting a new proxy with a later
date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above at any time up to 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on May 25, 2022, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to
the Company. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting virtually and voting
electronically at the special meeting; however, simply attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to
be revoked. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by
sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or
written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke
your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by
voting electronically at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker,
bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote at the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
A:
The requisite number of shares to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding on April 11, 2022, the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not
vote, or abstain from voting, on the Merger Proposal, or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal.
The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares of
Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that vote thereon. If you
abstain from voting on (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal or if you do not return
your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker, bank
or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), it will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a
quorum is present.
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Will my shares of Common Stock held in “street name” or held in another form of record ownership be
combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares of Common Stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a
different shareholder (that is, your broker, bank, or other nominee) than any shares of Common Stock you hold
of record, any shares of Common Stock held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with
shares of Common Stock held of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Common Stock in various registered
forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and
will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Common Stock because they are held in a
different form of record ownership. Shares of Common Stock held by a corporation or business entity must be
voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the
proxy card.
Q:
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
A:
If your shares of Common Stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive
more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting
instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of
your shares of Common Stock are voted.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger?
A:
In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Common Stock through completion
of the Merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger, you
will have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the completion of the
Merger. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock after the record date but before the closing of the Merger,
you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Q:
If the Merger is completed, how do I obtain the Merger Consideration for my shares of Common Stock?
A:
Following the completion of the Merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into the
right to receive your portion of the Merger Consideration. After the Merger is completed, if your shares of
Common Stock are evidenced by stock certificates, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials
from the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common
Stock evidenced by stock certificates for the Merger Consideration (without interest and subject to any required
tax withholding). If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other
nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you
need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
(without interest and subject to any required tax withholding).
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of Common
Stock with the proxy card. If the Merger is completed and if your shares of Common Stock are evidenced by
stock certificates, the paying agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and
instructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (without interest and
subject to any required tax withholding).
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
shareholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance
notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of
the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of
common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you
may have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The
broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral
request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
Q:
Where can I find more information about Meritor?
A:
You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the costs of soliciting proxies?
A:
The Meritor Board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. This includes the
charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of
our outstanding common stock. Meritor has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (which we refer to as
“Innisfree”), a proxy solicitation firm, to assist the Meritor Board in the solicitation of proxies for the special
meeting, and we expect to pay Innisfree approximately $25,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, email, telephone, or
via the Internet by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Meritor’s directors, officers and
employees.
Q:
Who can help answer my other questions?
A:
If you have more questions about the Merger or any of the other matters set forth in this proxy statement, or
require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this document or
the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent and information
agent for Meritor in connection with the special meeting. Meritor shareholders can contact Innisfree, with

As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, the special meeting will be held solely by means
of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting online and to vote your

At the special meeting, Meritor shareholders will be asked to consider and approve the following proposals:
•
the Merger Proposal;
•
the Compensation Proposal, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Transaction”; and
•
the Adjournment Proposal.
Our shareholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. If our shareholders fail to approve the
Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and certain provisions of the Merger Agreement are
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and
vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Meritor
or Parent. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be
payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and
arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Meritor shareholders.
No matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the special meeting.
This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our shareholders on or about April 18,
2022.

The holders of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on April 11, 2022, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record
date, 70,852,942 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence at the special meeting, virtually or represented by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the

constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. However, if a new record

Each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on
each of the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.
For the Company to complete the Merger, Meritor shareholders holding a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast
to approve the Merger Agreement must vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. An abstention with respect to the Merger
Proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other

Approval of each of (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares of Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that
vote thereon, but is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. An abstention with respect to either proposal or
as failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure to instruct
your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have no effect on these proposals,

Attendance
All holders of shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on April 11, 2022, the record date, including
shareholders of record and beneficial owners of Common Stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank or
other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting virtually.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” and you also wish to be able to vote at the meeting, you must obtain a legal
proxy, executed in your favor, from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Voting at the Special Meeting
Shareholders of record will be able to attend the special meeting virtually and vote electronically via the special
meeting website. If you are not a shareholder of record, but instead hold your shares of Common Stock in “street
name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your
broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote at the special meeting. Attending the special meeting
virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.
Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide
voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting virtually.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a shareholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described
below.
19TABLE OF CONTENTS
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with
instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the
Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of Common Stock will
be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as
described below.
Submit a Proxy Card by Mail. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is
received in time for the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on
your proxy card.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in
favor of each of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to return
your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless
you attend the special meeting virtually and vote electronically, your shares of Common Stock will not be considered
present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, which
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and, assuming a quorum is present, will have no
effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,” your
broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares.
Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by telephone or
via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.
In accordance with applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of Common
Stock in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to (i)
the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal or (iii) the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks
or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they cannot
vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the special meeting virtually with a
properly executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your
broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of Common Stock not being present at the meeting and not
being voted on any of the proposals. As a result, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure
to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but it will have no effect on the other proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Revocation of Proxies
Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it before it is voted. If
you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:
•
submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures
described above at any time up to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 25, 2022, or by completing, signing,
dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;
•
attending the special meeting virtually and voting electronically at the special meeting; or
•
delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at our
headquarters, 2135 West Maple Road, Troy, Michigan 48084-7186.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Virtually attending the special meeting without
taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke
your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company,
you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be
received by the Company before the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the
instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit
20

new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting
electronically at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other
nominee in order to be able to vote at the special meeting.

An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends the special meeting, either virtually or represented by proxy, but
abstains from voting. Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock

on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

The Chairman of the special meeting or the holders of a majority of shares present virtually or represented by proxy at
the special meeting, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn the special meeting. Adjournments and
postponements are also subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement. Meritor may not postpone or
adjourn the special meeting without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if Meritor reasonably determines in good faith, after consulting with its
outside legal counsel, that the Company Shareholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the special meeting,
including due to an absence of quorum, the Company may adjourn or postpone the special meeting, for a period no
longer than 30 calendar days, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal or (ii) if Parent reasonably
determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that the Company Shareholder Approval is
unlikely to be obtained at the special meeting, Parent may request that Meritor adjourn, delay or postpone the special
meeting.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company’s shareholders
and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (excluding (i) shares held by the Company as
treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger Sub (such shares, “Canceled Shares”) and (ii) shares held by any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or the Company (other than any such shares of Common Stock
held on behalf of third parties) (the “Converted Shares”)), and all rights in respect thereof, shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol
“MTOR”. Upon completion of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Following the completion of the Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from
the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, following which the Company will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the SEC with respect to its Common Stock in accordance with applicable law, rules and
regulations. The Company will therefore become a privately held company, wholly owned by Parent.
Background of the Merger",29,29
"MERITOR, INC._20220418_DEFM14A_20019751_4444368.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of Meritor’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Meritor
Board and Meritor’s senior management periodically review, consider and assess Meritor’s capabilities, operations,
financial performance and business plans, as well as overall industry conditions, opportunities and risks for the
company as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the
consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships
and other financial and strategic alternatives.
From the summer of 2019 to March 2020, representatives of Parent and the Company engaged in preliminary,
exploratory discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction, following discussions with, and authorization by,
the Meritor Board with the Meritor Board receiving advice and analysis from Meritor’s outside financial and legal
advisors at J.P. Morgan and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”) and the Parent Board with the
Parent Board receiving advice and analysis from Parent’s outside financial and legal advisors at Morgan Stanley and
Mayer Brown LLP (“Mayer Brown”). While Parent ultimately conveyed possible interest in pursuing a transaction at
a proposed valuation of $33.00 per share in cash (which interest was formalized in a non-binding letter setting forth
such proposal that was provided by Parent on February 13, 2020), and Parent had the opportunity to engage in
preliminary confidential business, financial and strategic diligence discussions that affirmed the strategic logic of a
combination pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement that Parent had entered into with Meritor (the
“Original Confidentiality Agreement”), Parent withdrew and terminated transaction discussions in March 2020 after
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in March 2020, Meritor sent Parent a letter requesting that it return or
destroy the diligence information that had been shared by Meritor and in April 2020, Parent sent a letter to Meritor
confirming the destruction of such diligence information.
Through 2020 and 2021, Meritor continued to evaluate regularly its business and strategic plans, industry dynamics,
Meritor’s positioning with investors and other stakeholders, opportunities and risks before the Company and
potential strategic and financial alternatives, including Meritor’s periodic discussions with Parent regarding various
strategic collaboration opportunities other than a business combination or merger.
22TABLE OF CONTENTS
In November 2020, as part of the Company’s planned succession planning processes, Meritor announced that Jay
Craig, Chief Executive Officer and President of Meritor, would transition to the role of Executive Chairman of the
Meritor Board on February 28, 2021, and that Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,
would succeed Mr. Craig as Chief Executive Officer and President at that time and would join the Meritor Board.
Meritor’s then-current independent Chairman, William R. Newlin, became lead independent director of the Meritor
Board as part of this transition plan. On November 12, 2021, Meritor announced that Mr. Newlin had been elected
Non-Executive Chairman, effective December 31, 2021, with Mr. Craig stepping down from his Executive Chairman role
and departing the Company.
In mid-November 2021, Tom Linebarger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Parent, conveyed to Mr. Craig that
Parent was interested in re-engaging in discussions to acquire Meritor. Mr. Craig indicated that he would apprise the
Meritor Board. The Meritor Board was then alerted of the development, the Company’s financial and legal advisors at
J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton were also apprised, with future meetings of the Meritor Board to be scheduled at
which the Meritor Board would deliberate and receive the advice of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton, including in the
event that Parent were to provide a specific proposal and indicative valuation that could warrant further
investigation, potential negotiation and consideration.
Throughout November and December 2021, and continuing into 2022, members of Meritor’s senior management
regularly consulted with Mr. Newlin in his capacity as lead independent director and Non-Executive Chairman of the
Meritor Board, in between the scheduled meetings of the Meritor Board to obtain his input and direction as to next
steps. Meritor Board members were also kept apprised of developments.
On November 18, 2021, Parent and Meritor entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement (the “New
Confidentiality Agreement”) with substantially similar terms as those of the Original Confidentiality Agreement.
Following further discussion, Parent was advised that Meritor would require receipt of a specific proposed valuation
in order to assess potential next steps and that, since Meritor planned to disclose to investors at Meritor’s December
7, 2021 Strategy Day meaningful amounts of new business and financial information regarding Meritor’s plans and
prospects, Meritor would share with Parent in advance of such public disclosure, pursuant to the New
Confidentiality Agreement, the information that Meritor would be making public so that such materials could be
considered in any proposal that Parent might make.
On November 22, 2021, Meritor provided Parent with an advance copy of materials it planned to publicly disclose at
its December 7, 2021 Strategy Day, pursuant to the New Confidentiality Agreement. Meritor responded to certain
follow-up questions from Parent on December 8, 2021.
On December 14, 2021, Mr. Linebarger conveyed to Meritor that Parent was interested in acquiring Meritor and sent a
letter to Messrs. Villavarayan and Craig setting forth a non-binding proposal (the “December Proposal”) for Parent to
acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Meritor for $33.50 per share in cash. The December Proposal noted
that the proposal would not be contingent on financing. The December Proposal also indicated that Parent expected
to be able to complete its due diligence of Meritor within a period of weeks.
On December 20, 2021, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor’s senior management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, the Meritor Board reviewed the
December Proposal and discussed the interactions with Parent. The Meritor Board discussed the December Proposal,
including in the context of financial analyses and alternatives presented by J.P. Morgan to the Meritor Board. A
representative of Wachtell Lipton provided an overview of the Meritor Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of the
consideration of a proposal to acquire Meritor. The Meritor Board discussed potential options and next steps, and
directed Meritor to provide Parent with a short period of limited due diligence in order to seek an increase in the
$33.50 per share offer price, which the Meritor Board believed undervalued Meritor, its prospects and its plans.
On December 21, 2021, Mr. Villavarayan, at the direction of the Meritor Board, provided a letter to Mr. Linebarger to
convey the Meritor Board’s position.
Between December 24, 2021 and January 13, 2022, J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Meritor Board and management,
and Meritor personnel provided limited due diligence information to representatives of Parent, and representatives of
Parent had several due diligence calls with members of senior management of Meritor, including a management
presentation by Meritor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 14, 2022, Mr. Linebarger submitted a letter to Messrs. Villavarayan and Newlin containing a non-binding
proposal (the “First January Proposal”) for Parent to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Meritor for
$35.00 per share in cash. The First January Proposal noted the transaction would not be contingent on financing. The
First January Proposal also indicated that Parent expected to be able to complete its remaining due diligence of
Meritor within approximately three weeks.
On January 18, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor’s senior management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan
described the due diligence process with Parent, as well as the financial terms of the First January Proposal and J.P.
Morgan’s financial analysis of the proposed merger consideration set forth in the First January Proposal. A
representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed legal matters, including an overview of the Meritor Board’s fiduciary
duties in the context of the Meritor Board’s consideration of the First January Proposal. The Meritor Board discussed
various options and next steps, and directed Meritor to provide Parent with additional due diligence information in
order to seek an increase in the offer price, which the Meritor Board believed continued to undervalue Meritor. The
Meritor Board also considered whether to solicit indications of interest from other potential financial sponsors or
strategic buyers and concluded, with the benefit of advice from J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton, not to do so at this
time, while reserving ultimate judgment on the matter, taking into account the risk of leaks, the damage and disruption
to Meritor and its stakeholders, including employees and customer relationships, were a leak to occur in the absence
of a definitive transaction announcement, the uncertainty as to whether alternative compelling third-party bids would
emerge (and the Meritor Board’s believed low likelihood of such bids emerging) and the benefits from continuing to
see if Parent could present a compelling proposal.
On January 21, 2022, Mr. Villavarayan, at the direction of the Meritor Board, met with Mr. Linebarger to convey the
Meritor Board’s position at its January 18 meeting and to discuss the need for Parent to submit an improved proposal
if Parent wished to have the opportunity to have the Meritor Board consider a potential transaction with Parent.
Over the next few days, Meritor provided Parent with additional due diligence information, and an additional meeting
was held between senior management of Meritor and senior management of Parent regarding areas of additional
value in the transaction that would justify Parent increasing its offer price.
On January 26, 2022, Mr. Linebarger submitted a letter to Messrs. Villavarayan and Newlin containing a non-binding
proposal (the “Second January Proposal”) for Parent to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Meritor for
$36.50 per share in cash, which Parent characterized as its last and final offer. The Second January Proposal requested
that Parent be provided a three week exclusivity period to complete confirmatory due diligence and negotiate
definitive transaction documentation.
On January 27, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor’s senior management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan
described the interactions with Parent since the January 18, 2022 Meritor Board meeting and the financial terms of the
Second January Proposal, as well as J.P. Morgan’s financial analysis of the proposed merger consideration set forth
in the Second January Proposal. A representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed legal matters, including the Meritor
Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of the Meritor Board’s consideration of the Second January Proposal. The
Meritor Board next discussed the Second January Proposal, including in comparison to Meritor’s standalone
prospects, as well as whether other potential bidders would be capable of and willing to offer a more attractive value
than Parent’s $36.50 per share all-cash proposal. The Meritor Board determined not to solicit alternative third-party
interest at this time due to, among other things, potential impact on Parent’s proposal and the risk of a leak, as well as
management’s assessment of the low likelihood of obtaining a superior offer for Meritor. The Meritor Board
authorized management to continue to explore a transaction with Parent by moving forward with due diligence and
negotiation of definitive documentation so that the Meritor Board would have the opportunity to consider a complete
proposal inclusive of all material terms and to do so without entering into an exclusivity agreement with Parent.
After the meeting, Mr. Villavarayan called Mr. Linebarger to provide a summary of the Meritor Board’s position at its
meeting that day. A representative of J.P. Morgan then sent, at the direction of the Meritor Board, a draft merger
agreement to representatives of Morgan Stanley that had been prepared by Wachtell Lipton.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the end of January into February 2022, Meritor made available to Parent and Parent’s representatives certain due
diligence information in a confidential data room. Thereafter, Parent, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted
additional due diligence on Meritor, including through telephone calls with Meritor management and exchange of
materials.
On February 5, 2022, a representative of Parent’s outside legal counsel from Mayer Brown sent a revised draft of the
merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.
On February 10, 2022, a representative of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Mayer Brown. Through the course of negotiations, Wachtell Lipton and Mayer Brown discussed
various items in the merger agreement, including regulatory provisions, termination fee amounts, interim operating
covenants and fiduciary matters.
Between February 10, 2022 and February 21, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Mayer Brown, with input
from Meritor and Parent, continued to exchange and negotiate drafts of the merger agreement.
Also on February 10, 2021, Messrs. Villavarayan and Linebarger discussed certain key issues in the merger
agreement.
On February 14, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor’s senior management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan
presented an update on the diligence process to date and representatives of Wachtell Lipton presented an update on
merger agreement negotiations with Parent and a range of potential approaches to finalizing the merger agreement.
After discussing, the Meritor Board determined that Meritor should continue the current course of negotiations with
Parent.
Also on February 14, 2021, Messrs. Villavarayan and Linebarger discussed the key issues in the merger agreement.
Between February 14, 2022 and February 21, 2022, the parties and their respective advisors worked to finalize the
definitive transaction documents, with all remaining open points having been substantially resolved by the afternoon
of February 21, 2022.
On February 21, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor’s senior management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton again reviewed
the fiduciary duties of the directors and provided a summary of the proposed terms of the merger agreement. A
representative of J.P. Morgan then reviewed J.P. Morgan’s financial analysis of the proposed Merger Consideration in
the proposed transaction with Parent. After discussion among the Meritor Board and representatives of Wachtell
Lipton and J.P. Morgan, a representative of J.P. Morgan tendered to the Board J.P. Morgan’s oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by the delivery of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion, dated February 21, 2022, to the Meritor
Board to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations
and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed
Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. After additional discussions of the proposed
transaction and the matters summarized for the Meritor Board at the meeting, the Meritor Board unanimously (1)
approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, (2)
determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its shareholders, (3) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for their
approval and (4) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the
Company’s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement.
Later in the evening on February 21, 2022, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement.
Early in the morning on February 22, 2022, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.",29,32

The Meritor Board evaluated, with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors, the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, and, on February 21, 2022, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement
and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and approved,
adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger.
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the course of making the unanimous recommendation, the Meritor Board considered a range of factors, including
those below (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance) relating to the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, each of which the Meritor Board believed supported its decision:
•
the Meritor Board’s assessment of Meritor’s business, assets, current and projected financial performance
and condition, earnings, prospects and outlook, including taking into account Meritor’s potential for, and
risks and uncertainties to, future growth and value creation;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides the Company’s shareholders immediate
certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Common Stock and enables the Company’s shareholders
to realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution
risk;
•
the information provided by Meritor’s financial advisor;
•
the current and historical market prices of the shares of Common Stock, including the market performance
of the shares of Common Stock relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry and
general market indices and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share represented a
premium of approximately 48% to the closing price on the last trading day before the Merger Agreement
was executed and reflected an implied transaction multiple above the select precedent transaction multiples
used in the Company’s financial advisor’s analysis;
•
the Meritor Board’s view of industry trends, the substantially increasing levels of capital investment
needed to navigate the evolving electrification environment and the increasing number and size of
traditional and emerging competitors, including those with substantially enhanced scale relative to the
Company and the various risks and considerations with respect to continuing to execute the Company’s
standalone plans and operating as an independent public company;
•
the belief that the Company’s customers will benefit from the combined company’s enhanced capabilities in
product offerings for internal combustion and electrified powertrain application, and in technology and the
ability to accelerate investment in axle and brake development and electric vehicle refinements with
increased adoption in the markets as a result of the Transactions;
•
the belief that Meritor and Parent have complementary portfolios that will help the combined company
develop economically viable zero carbon solutions for commercial and industrial applications and the belief
that Meritor and Parent share a similar customer-first focus and commitment to excellence, innovation,
collaboration and technology leadership;
•
the belief that the Merger provides a unique opportunity to better serve and innovate for Meritor’s
customers, and to access new customers around the world, enhance overall community value through
increased investment and provide new and expanded career and growth opportunities for Meritor
employees;
•
the belief that the Company’s employees should benefit from the greater stability and opportunities
provided by the combined company’s enhanced ability to invest in new product offerings and advanced
technology;
•
the Meritor Board’s concern regarding the potential impact of any potential economic downturn on the
price of shares of Common Stock (and on the potential valuation that counterparties would be willing to
pay);
•
the course and history of the negotiations between Meritor and Parent, as described under “- Background
of the Merger,” including the Meritor Board’s success in having Parent raise its offer several times for the
benefit of Meritor’s shareholders through constructive engagement and achieve a level reflecting a
substantial premium and a favorable valuation relative to various metrics and methodologies and the
Meritor Board’s belief that Parent’s offer of $36.50 per share was Parent’s best and final offer, which best
and final status was affirmed by Parent and Parent’s representatives;
•
the belief of the Meritor Board that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms for
the Company, in the aggregate, to which Parent was willing to agree;
26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the belief, based on the advice of Meritor’s financial advisor and its knowledge of the industry and the
operations of Meritor, that it was unlikely that any other financial sponsors or strategic buyers would be
willing to acquire Meritor at a price in excess of $36.50 per share in cash (and no such party had submitted
such a bid) and agree to and ultimately consummate the Merger on the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement, and that if Meritor were to conduct an auction process or other active solicitation of alternative
acquisition proposals, doing so would create risk and possible loss or destruction of value;
•
the Meritor Board’s belief that Parent may have pursued business combinations, acquisitions or
partnerships with other third parties in the event the Merger was not consummated, creating potential long
term risks and potentially adverse impacts to the Company, including if such developments were to occur
and strengthen other companies to Meritor’s detriment;
•
the high degree of certainty that the closing will be achieved in a timely manner, in view of the terms of the
Merger Agreement, including, among other things, that the effects of COVID-19 were excepted from the
definition of a Company Material Adverse Effect, and other provisions and protections increasing the level
of certainty afforded to the Merger ultimately being consummated;
•
the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 21, 2022, that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein,
the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such shareholders, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “- Opinion of Meritor’s Financial Advisor”;
•
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including:
•
the requirement that the Merger Agreement be approved by the holders of a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement;
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which the Meritor Board believed are
reasonable and customary in number and scope;
•
the fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably
practical, the risk that a condition to closing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable
flexibility to operate Meritor’s business during the pendency of the Merger, including with respect to
actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise;
•
the provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Meritor Board, subject to certain conditions, to
provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an
unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal;
•
the provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Meritor Board to withdraw or change its
recommendation of the Merger Agreement and to terminate the Merger Agreement, in certain
circumstances relating to the presence of a Company Superior Proposal (or to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event) subject, in certain cases, to paying the
Company Termination Fee;
•
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and Parent’s ability to finance the
Merger without difficulty;
•
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Meritor in the Merger
Agreement;
•
the ability of Meritor to specifically enforce Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement,
including Parent’s obligations to complete the Merger;
•
the belief that the Termination Date, as it may be extended, if applicable, allows for sufficient time to
complete the Merger;
•
the fact that Parent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary governmental
approvals with respect to the Merger, including agreeing to remedies as necessary to obtain any
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such approval, subject to certain limitations as to the remedies and actions that Parent would be
required to take, which limitations and other relevant provisions are further described under the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the Merger”;
•
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain
circumstances, Parent will pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee as more fully described under
the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Parent Termination Fees”; and
•
the Meritor Board’s view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested third
parties from making a Company Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement’s terms and conditions
related to a Change of Recommendation, the Company’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in favor
of an alternative Company Superior Proposal if certain provisions were satisfied, the payment by the
Company of a relatively low Company Termination Fee in connection with the termination of the Merger
Agreement under certain circumstances, and the Board’s belief that the overall terms relating to the
foregoing were appropriate and favorable to the Company and its shareholders taking into account the
specific circumstances involved (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement -
Company Takeover Proposal; Non-Solicitation”).
In addition, the Meritor Board also weighed the advantages and benefits against a variety of risks and other
potentially negative factors (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance), including the following:
•
the fact that the Company’s shareholders generally will have no ongoing equity participation in the
Company following the Merger, and that such shareholders will cease to participate in the Company’s
future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of shares of Common
Stock, and will not participate in any potential future sale of the Company to a third party;
•
the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any litigation
that may result from the announcement or pendency of the Merger;
•
the risk that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger
will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if the Merger
Agreement is approved by the Company’s shareholders;
•
the risk that certain regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger may not be obtained;
•
the Merger Agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of
the Merger, generally requiring the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course , subject to
specific limitations and certain exceptions, which may nevertheless delay or prevent the Company from
pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and taking other actions with respect to its business
that the Company may consider advantageous pending completion of the Merger;
•
the risks and costs to the Company if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management
and employee attention, potential effects on the ability to retain employees and the potential effect on
business and customer and supplier relationships;
business and customer and supplier relationships;
•
the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that certain of the Company’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s shareholders, as further described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “- Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger”;
•
the covenants in the Merger Agreement prohibiting Parent from soliciting other potential acquisition
proposals, and restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain
conditions are satisfied;
•
the fact that Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee only if certain conditions are met, as
further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Parent
Termination Fee”;
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the requirement that the Company pay the Company Termination Fee, under certain circumstances
following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if Meritor terminates the Merger Agreement to
accept a Company Superior Proposal, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee”; and
•
the fact that the announcement of the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to
complete the Merger, may cause substantial harm to the Company’s relationships with its employees
(including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key
management, technical, sales and other personnel), suppliers and customers and may divert employees’
attention away from the Company’s day-to-day business operations.
After considering the foregoing factors, the Meritor Board concluded that, overall, the potentially beneficial factors
relating to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, outweighed the risks and potentially
negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meritor Board is not exhaustive but is
intended to reflect the material factors considered by the Meritor Board in its consideration of the Merger Agreement
and the Transactions, including the Merger. In view of the complexity and the large number of factors considered, the
Meritor Board, individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various
factors. Rather, the Meritor Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and
considered by it. In addition, individual members of the Meritor Board may have given different weights to different
factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meritor Board is forward-looking in
nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under the caption “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”
THE MERITOR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE MERGER PROPOSAL.
Opinion of Meritor’s Financial Advisor
Pursuant to an engagement letter, Meritor retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed Merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger. Meritor decided to
engage J.P. Morgan due to, among other things, its extensive experience in Meritor’s industry, its qualifications and
its deep expertise in the matters that were to be considered by the Meritor Board.
At the meeting of the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board of
Directors of Meritor that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations
and qualifications set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common
Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its
February 21, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Meritor Board, dated February 21, 2022, that, as
of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such shareholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated February 21, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Meritor’s shareholders are urged to
read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Meritor Board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the
consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the
Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion
does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Meritor as to how such shareholder should vote with
respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated February 20, 2022 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Meritor and the
industries in which it operates;
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of Meritor with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of Meritor common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Meritor relating
to its business, including the Projections; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Meritor with respect to certain
aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of Meritor, the financial condition and future
prospects and operations of Meritor, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its
inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Meritor or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P.
Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,
pursuant to J.P. Morgan’s engagement letter with Meritor, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake
any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal
of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Meritor under any applicable laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or
derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of Meritor to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and
the other Transactions will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement, and that the definitive Merger
Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by Meritor and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the
related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal,
regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to Meritor with respect to such issues. J.P.
Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Meritor or on the contemplated benefits
of the Merger.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of
any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Meritor or as to the underlying decision by Meritor
to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such
persons relative to the consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger or with respect
to the fairness of any such compensation.
J.P. Morgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect
to the sale of all or any part of Meritor or any other alternative transaction. The terms of the Merger Agreement were
determined through arm’s length negotiations between Meritor and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger
Agreement was solely that of the Meritor Board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the
many factors considered by the Meritor Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Meritor Board or management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger
Consideration.
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022 and in the financial analyses
contained in the presentation delivered to the Meritor Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such
opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with
rendering such opinion and contained in such presentation, and does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the
financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.
Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Meritor with similar data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to Meritor. The
companies selected by J.P. Morgan (the “Selected Companies”) were:
Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.
Dana Inc.
SAF-HOLLAND SE
Modine Manufacturing Co.
Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc.
Haldex AB
The Selected Companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses
that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of
Meritor and/or one or more of its businesses. The Selected Companies may be considered similar to Meritor or such
businesses based on the nature of their assets and operations; however, none of the companies selected is identical
or directly comparable to Meritor or such businesses, and certain of these companies may have characteristics that
are materially different from those of Meritor or such businesses. J.P. Morgan’s analyses necessarily involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect Meritor or such
businesses.
Using information obtained from the Selected Companies’ public filings and FactSet Research Systems as of February
18, 2022, J.P. Morgan calculated for each Selected Company the ratio of such company’s firm value (calculated as the
market value of the company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any debt and minority interest, less cash
and cash equivalents) to the equity research analyst estimate for such company’s adjusted earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), for each of 2022 and 2023, calendarized based on a
September 30 fiscal year end, which we refer to as FV / 2022E Adjusted EBITDA and FV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA,
respectively. For ease of presentation, September 30 is used to represent the Company’s fiscal year end, as the
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to September 30. The following table represents the results of this
analysis for each of the Selected Companies:

Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its
experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 4.50x to 7.00x for FV / 2022E
Adjusted EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 4.00x to 6.50x for FV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA.
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
J.P. Morgan applied these ranges to Meritor’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023 based
on the Projections, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled Certain Meritor Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information, to derive a range of firm values for Meritor, which was then adjusted to take into
account Meritor’s net debt and non-controlling interest balance totaling $1,029 million in the aggregate as of
December 31, 2021 to derive a range of implied equity values for Meritor. The analysis indicated the following ranges
of implied per share equity value for the Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25:
Implied Per Share
Equity Value
(rounded to the
nearest $0.25)
Low
High
FV/2022E Adj. EBITDA
$18.50
$36.75
FV/2023E Adj. EBITDA
$17.25
$36.75
The ranges of implied per share equity value were compared to (i) the closing price per share of Common Stock on
February 18, 2022 of $24.67, and (ii) the Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.
Selected Transaction Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan reviewed selected transactions (the “Selected Transactions”)
involving businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis and based on its experience and professional
judgment, were considered by J.P. Morgan to be similar to Meritor’s business. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the
Selected Transactions set forth in the below table.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each Selected Transaction, the ratio of the target
company’s firm value implied by the consideration paid in such transaction to the target company’s Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve calendar-month period (“LTM”) prior to announcement of the applicable transaction
(“FV/LTM Adjusted EBITDA”). The following table represents the results of this analysis for each of the Selected

Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its
experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 5.75x to 8.75x for FV/LTM
Adjusted EBITDA and applied it to Meritor’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, to
derive a range of firm values for Meritor, which was then adjusted to take into account Meritor’s net debt, non-
controlling interest and receivables factoring balance totaling $1,349 million in the aggregate as of December 31, 2021
to derive a range of implied equity values for Meritor. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per
share of Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $14.75 to $32.00, which was compared to (a) the closing
price per share of Common Stock of $24.67 as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the Merger Consideration of $36.50 per
share of Common Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity
value per share for the Common Stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using
estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value
of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their “present value.” The “unlevered free cash
flows,” for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated
by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. “Present value” refers to the current
value of the future cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the
present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the cost of
capital and other appropriate factors. “Terminal value” refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated
by the asset for periods beyond the projections period.
J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of the future standalone unlevered after-tax free cash flows for the three
fiscal quarters ending October 2, 2022 and for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2025 based upon the Projections
(the “DCF Projection Period”). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Meritor by applying a range
of perpetuity growth rates, as provided by management of Meritor, ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% of the unlevered free
cash flows of Meritor during the final year of the DCF Projection Period. The unlevered free cash flows and the range
of terminal values were then discounted from September 30 of each year to present values as of December 31, 2021
using a mid-year convention and a range of discount rates from 9.75% to 10.75%. The discount rate range was
selected by J.P. Morgan based on J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for Meritor.
In addition, as directed by management of Meritor, J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of certain tax credits
expected to be utilized by Meritor through fiscal year 2029, which were discounted from September 30 of each year to
present values as of December 31, 2021 using the same mid-year convention and a discount range of 9.75% to
10.75%. The total tax credit utilization amounts provided by management of Meritor were $28 million for the three
fiscal quarters ending October 2, 2022, and $32 million, $28 million, $31 million, $29 million, $11 million, $15 million and
$15 million, for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2029, respectively. The present values were then added together
with the present values derived based on the unlevered free cash flows to derive a range of firm values for Meritor,
which was then adjusted to take into account Meritor’s net debt, non-controlling interest and receivables factoring
balance totaling $1,349 million in the aggregate as of December 31, 2021 to derive a range of implied equity values for
Meritor.
Based on the foregoing, these analyses indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Common Stock,
rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $28.75 to $38.25. The range of implied equity values per share of Common Stock were
compared to (a) the closing price per share of Common Stock of $24.67 as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the Merger
Consideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.
Other Information
52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan
reviewed the trading range for the Common Stock for the 52-week period ended February 18, 2022, which was $20.50
per share to $32.93 per share, and compared that range to (a) the closing price per share of Common Stock of $24.67
as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the proposed Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.
Analyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the
publicly available equity research analyst price target range for the Common Stock available as of February 18, 2022,
and noted that such price target range was $26.00 per share to $34.00 per share, and compared that price target range
to (a) the closing price per share of Common Stock of $24.67 as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the proposed Merger
Consideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create
points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the
actual value of Meritor. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to
those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any
analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor
(positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan
considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the Selected
Companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to Meritor, and none of the Selected
Transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be
considered similar to those of Meritor. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants,
size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Meritor and
the transactions compared to the Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Meritor with respect to the Merger
and deliver an opinion to the Meritor Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such
experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with Meritor and
the industries in which it operates.
J.P. Morgan received a fee from Meritor of $5.0 million for delivery of its opinion. Meritor has agreed to pay J.P.
Morgan a transaction fee equal to 1.0% of the Merger Consideration upon the closing of the transaction, against
which the opinion fee will be credited. In addition, Meritor has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable,
documented and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of external counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P.
Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its
affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Meritor and Parent for which J.P. Morgan and
such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as
joint lead arranger on Parent’s credit facilities, which closed in August 2021, joint lead bookrunner on Meritor’s
offerings of debt securities, which closed in June 2020 and November 2020, and joint lead active bookrunner on
Parent’s offering of debt securities, which closed in August 2020. During the two year period preceding the delivery
of its opinion ending on February 21, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Meritor were
approximately $2.0 million and from Parent were approximately $9.5 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses,
J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Meritor or Parent for their own accounts or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments.

While Meritor has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Meritor has not, as a matter of
course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections by year as to future performance, earnings or other results
beyond the then current annual period, and is especially wary of making projections for extended periods, due to,
among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the
uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Meritor is including in this
34TABLE OF CONTENTS
proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information of Meritor on a standalone
basis, without giving effect to the Merger (the “Projections”), prepared by Meritor’s management, solely because
such financial information was given to the Meritor Board and J.P. Morgan as described below. Meritor advised the
recipients of the Projections that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in many respects, and the inclusion of
the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication of future results or an accurate
prediction of future results, and should not be relied on as such.
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward
compliance with published guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentations of financial projections. This information is prospective and should not be relied upon
as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on the Projections. The Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s
management. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any independent
accountants, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections and, accordingly,
the Company’s independent registered accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
on the Projections or their achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the
Projections. Meritor’s independent registered public accounting firm’s report, contained in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement, relates to Meritor’s historical financial information and does not extend to the Projections and should not
be read to do so. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after
the date they were prepared.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company
performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties
and beyond Meritor’s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” could cause the Projections or the underlying assumptions to be
inaccurate. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections, and accordingly,
there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Meritor’s shareholders are
urged to review Meritor’s most recent SEC filings for a description of the reported and anticipated results of
operations and financial condition and capital resources, including in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Meritor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
October 3, 2021, and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement.
The inclusion of a summary of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that
any of Meritor, Parent or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives considered
the Projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the Projections should not be relied upon as
such nor should the information contained in the Projections be considered appropriate for other purposes. None of
Meritor, Parent or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any
assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections. Meritor undertakes no obligation to
update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections
were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the Projections are shown to be in error.
The Company has not made and makes no representation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other person, in the Merger
Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Projections or regarding Meritor’s ultimate performance compared to the
information contained in the Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Meritor urges all of its
shareholders to review Meritor’s most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company’s reported financial
results.
Projections
The following is a summary of the unaudited Meritor prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through
2025 that was prepared by the Company’s management. The Projections were prepared by Meritor’s management in
December 2021 and were provided to the Meritor Board in connection with its consideration and evaluation of a
potential transaction with Parent. The Projections were also provided to J.P Morgan in connection with its financial
analysis and opinion, as discussed in the section entitled “- Opinion of Meritor’s Financial
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Advisor.” The Projections are based solely on the information available to Meritor’s management at those times, and
do not give effect to the Merger. The summary of the Projections included in this proxy statement are presented to
give Meritor shareholders access to the financial projections that were made available to the Meritor Board and J.P
Morgan. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence your decision,
if you are a Meritor shareholder, to vote for the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures, loss on sale of receivables, restructuring expenses, asset
impairment charges and other special items as determined by management.
General
Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Projections not to be achieved include risks and
uncertainties relating to Meritor’s business and other factors described under “Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Statements,” as well as the risk factors with respect to the Company’s business contained in its
most recent SEC filings, which shareholders are urged to review, which may be found as described under “Where You
Can Find More Information.” In addition, the Projections cover multiple future years, and such information by its
nature is less reliable in predicting each successive year. The Projections also do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared and do not give effect to the
Transactions, including the Merger, and also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be
completed. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a
result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower than projected.
The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Meritor
or its affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the Projections to be predictive of actual future events, and
the Projections should not be relied on as such. None of Meritor or its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees,
directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Projections, and
none of those persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections to
reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future
events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections are shown to be in error. The
Company does not intend to publicly update or make any other revision to the Projections. None of Meritor or any of
its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other person regarding Meritor’s ultimate performance compared to the Projections or
that the results reflected therein will be achieved. For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement
are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections.
Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Meritor Board to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, Meritor
shareholders should be aware that Meritor’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meritor shareholders generally. The Meritor Board was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in
reaching its decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and in
recommending to Meritor shareholders that the Merger Agreement be approved. Such interests are described below.
The Merger will be a “change in control” for purposes of certain Meritor executive compensation and benefit plans
and agreements described below.
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Meritor’s executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Chris
Villavarayan (President and Chief Executive Officer), Carl D. Anderson II (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer), Timothy Bowes (Senior Vice President and President, Electrification, Industrial and North America
Aftermarket), and John Nelligan (Senior Vice President and President, Truck, Americas). Jeffrey A. Craig (former
Executive Chairman of the Meritor Board) is not included in the discussion below because his employment with
Meritor terminated upon his retirement on December 31, 2021 and as such he is not entitled to any of the payments or
benefits described below. Likewise, Hannah S. Lim-Johnson (former Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and
Corporate Secretary) is not included in the discussion below because her employment with Meritor terminated on
October 25, 2021 and as such she is not entitled to any of the payments or benefits described below. Meritor’s
executive officer who is not a named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below is Ken Hogan (Senior
Vice President and President, Truck, Europe and Asia Pacific).
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Meritor common stock is $36.50, which is the per share merger consideration;
•
the Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on April 11, 2022, which is the assumed date of the
Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
the employment of each executive officer of Meritor was terminated by the surviving corporation without
“cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the
relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the assumed date
of the Effective Time of April 11, 2022.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before completion of the Merger.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding Meritor
equity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:
•
each share of Meritor restricted common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, with each holder of such shares receiving the
same Merger Consideration as all other outstanding shareholders of Meritor common stock at the Effective
Time;
•
each Meritor RSU Award will be converted into a Converted RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Meritor RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all service-based vesting conditions; provided that any
accelerated vesting applicable to such Meritor RSU Award in the event of a “qualifying termination of
employment” (as such term is defined in the applicable Meritor long-term incentive plan, and set forth
below) occurring after the closing date shall apply for the remaining term of such Converted RSU Award;
and
•
each Meritor PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) scheduled to
vest on or prior to September 30, 2024 will fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common
Stock subject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable taxes
and (ii) scheduled to vest after September 30, 2024 will be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock
subject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including all service-based vesting conditions; provided that any accelerated vesting applicable to such
Meritor PSU Award in the event of a qualifying termination
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of employment occurring after the closing date shall apply for the remaining term of such Converted PSU
Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Meritor PSU
Award with a performance period that is incomplete (or that is complete but for which performance is not
determinable due to the unavailability of the required data for relative measures) as of the Effective Time
will be determined by deeming the performance goals applicable to such Meritor PSU Award to be achieved
at the target level of performance.
In the case of any Meritor Equity Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, all payments with respect to
such Meritor Equity Award shall be made in accordance with and at the earliest time as is consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and Meritor Equity Awards may be treated in an alternate method to the
extent required by law or agreed by the Parties.
For purposes of the Meritor Equity Awards and the officer employment agreements described below, the term
“qualifying termination of employment” means a termination of the employee's employment by Meritor without
“cause” (defined as any act of fraud or intentional misrepresentation or embezzlement, misappropriation or
conversion of assets of Meritor or any affiliate, or the intentional and repeated violation of the written policies or
procedures of Meritor), due to the employee's death, retirement or disability, or by the employee for “good reason”
(defined as the occurrence of any of the following events without the employee’s written consent: (i) a material
diminution in the employee’s base salary; (ii) a relocation of the employee’s principal place of employment by more
than 50 miles; (iii) any material breach by Meritor of any material provision of the applicable Meritor long-term
incentive plan; or (iv) a material diminution in the employee’s authority, duties or responsibilities).
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” for an estimate of the value of each of Meritor’s
named executive officer’s unvested Meritor equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above under “-
Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the Effective Time to
Meritor’s executive officer who is not a named executive officer in respect of his unvested Meritor equity awards
granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement is as follows: unvested Meritor RSU Awards-$1,158,729.00;
unvested Meritor PSU Awards scheduled to vest on or prior to September 30, 2024-$592,833.00; and unvested
Meritor PSU Awards scheduled to vest after September 30, 2024-$597,651.00 (based on the achievement of target
performance). As of the assumed effective date of April 11, 2022, 16,374 Meritor PSU Awards scheduled to vest after
September 30, 2024 were held by such executive officers. Shares of Meritor restricted common stock held by
Meritor’s non-employee directors vest on the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of their grant date or the date
the director resigns or ceases to serve on the board in accordance with the director compensation policy.
Officer Employment Agreements
Each Meritor executive officer has entered into an employment agreement with Meritor that provides that, in the
event that the officer’s employment with Meritor is terminated within two years following a change in control of
Meritor by Meritor as a result of a qualifying termination of employment (as defined above), then Meritor will be
obligated to pay the officer (a) any accrued and unpaid salary and vacation through the executive’s date of
separation from service (as such term is defined in the applicable agreement) paid in lump sum within thirty calendar
days of said separation or earlier as may be required by law, (b) the officer’s then-current annual base salary, payable
ratably in equal semi-monthly installments over a period of 18 months (the “Severance Period”), (c) the full target
amount of the officer’s annual bonus under the Meritor annual incentive compensation plan for the year in which the
termination occurs, paid out in a lump sum within 30 days after the qualifying termination of employment, (d)
continuation of health coverage (other than accidental death and dismemberment and long-term and short-term
disability coverage) throughout the Severance Period (or until the executive becomes subsequently employed and
covered by the health plan of the new employer), (e) continued life insurance coverage through the end of the
Severance Period, and (f) reasonable outplacement services for twelve months, the cost of which may not exceed
$10,000. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the employment agreements of (i)
Meritor’s named executive officers, and (ii) Meritor’s executive officer who is not a named executive officer for
purposes of this section, may be extended on the same terms and conditions for an additional one-year period from
December 1, 2022 to December 1, 2023, consistent with past practice but in any event before closing.
The executive officer employment agreements provide that, if the compensation and benefits payable to the officer
would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, such amounts will either be paid in
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
full or reduced to the level that would avoid application of the excise tax, whichever would place the executive officer
in a better after-tax position.
Pursuant to the terms of each executive officer employment agreement, each executive officer is subject to a
noncompetition covenant that applies during employment and for a period of 18 months following termination of
employment for any reason, and a nonsolicitation covenant that applies during employment and for a period of 12
months following termination of employment for any reason.
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” for the estimated amounts that each of Meritor’s
named executive officers would receive under their employment agreements upon a qualifying termination of
employment following a change in control of Meritor. Based on the assumptions described above under “-Certain
Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance payments (including a target annual cash
incentive award) that Meritor’s executive officer who is not a named executive officer would receive under his
employment agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control of Meritor is
$1,037,484.
Transaction Bonus Awards
In connection with the Merger, Meritor intends to establish a cash transaction bonus program for executive officers
not to exceed $13 million in the aggregate, to be allocated by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Bonuses
under this program will be paid 50% on the closing date and the remaining 50% will be paid on the first paycheck after
the 90th day following the closing date (the “Retention Date”). If the executive officer experiences a qualifying
termination of employment after the closing date and before the Retention Date, the remaining 50% of the transaction
bonus will be paid to such executive officer. The executive officer forfeits the right to any and all unpaid portions of
the transaction bonus if their employment is terminated prior to the closing date. The transaction bonus program is
intended to reward certain executives of Meritor for the focus and resources they provided with respect to the
Merger, driving operational excellence and results and assist in retaining key employees through the closing of the
Merger. Each executive officer is eligible to receive awards under such program, but the recipients of such awards
and their respective award amounts, if any, have not yet been determined.
Treatment of Cash Incentive Compensation Plan Awards
Under the terms of the Meritor Incentive Compensation Plan and its sub-plans (the “ICP”) and the Merger
Agreement: (a) if the closing occurs before the end of fiscal year 2022, Meritor may provide to each Meritor employee
who is eligible to participate in the ICP, including each executive officer, the full incentive amounts payable for fiscal
year 2022 with such amounts determined based on the greater of actual or target performance; (b) if the closing
occurs after the end of fiscal year 2022 but before the date incentive amounts would otherwise be paid under the ICP
in the ordinary course, Meritor may provide to each Meritor employee who is eligible to participate in the ICP,
including each executive officer, accelerated payment of such bonus amounts based on actual performance; and (c) if
the closing occurs during fiscal year 2023, Meritor may provide to each Meritor employee who is eligible to
participate in the ICP, including each executive officer, a prorated portion of the annual incentive under the ICP with
respect to the portion of the year of the closing that occurs prior to the closing, which bonus will be determined
based on target performance (provided that any executive officer who is entitled to a full target bonus upon a
qualifying termination pursuant to an employment agreement will not receive a duplicate payment under the ICP).
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” for the estimated amount of the ICP payment that
each of Meritor’s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the merger agreement.
Based on the assumptions described above under “-Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate “single trigger”
amount of the ICP payments (for purposes of this quantification assuming target performance and that the closing
occurs on or prior to the last day of fiscal year 2022) that Meritor’s executive officer who is not a named executive
officer would receive under the ICP is $301,275.
2023 Annual Equity Award Grants
Meritor and Parent have agreed that, if the closing occurs after November 15, 2022, Meritor may grant 2023 annual
equity awards to Meritor’s executive officers under the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan in the ordinary course of
business with the grant date fair value of such awards not to exceed $16 million, provided that such
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
awards cannot provide for vesting at closing and will be converted into restricted cash awards at closing (with PSUs
converting into time-vesting awards based on target performance), but can provide for accelerated vesting on a
qualifying termination of employment any time after the closing.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Meritor’s non-employee directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies
following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Indemnification and Insurance.”
Quantification Of Potential Payments And Benefits To Meritor’s Named Executive Officers In Connection
With The Transaction
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Meritor that is
based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits
described below, see the discussion under the caption “Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger. The ultimate
values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set
forth below. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of Meritor common stock is $36.50, which is the per share merger
consideration;
•
The effective time as referenced in this section occurs on April 11, 2022, which is the assumed date of the
effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each named executive officer of Meritor was terminated by the surviving corporation
without “cause” or due to the officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the
relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the effective time and on the assumed
date of the effective time of April 11, 2022.

Cash. Consists of a cash severance equal to (i) the executive officer’s annual base salary in effect immediately before the date of
termination payable ratably in equal semi-monthly installments over a period of 18 months, and (ii) full target amount of the
annual bonus under the Meritor annual incentive compensation plan, paid out in a lump sum within 30 days after a qualifying
termination of employment. The cash severance described in clause (i) and bonus payment described in clause (ii) are “double
trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment within two years following a change in control
of Meritor under the terms of the applicable employment agreement. The annual bonus payment described in clause (ii) and
shown in the Annual Bonus column below is also the “single trigger” amount that would be paid under the ICP as described above
at the closing (for purposes of this quantification assuming target performance and that the closing occurs on or prior to the last
day of fiscal year 2022). The amounts shown in this column are based on compensation and target annual bonus levels assumed to
be in effect on April 11, 2022, which are the same as those in effect on the date of this proxy statement; therefore, if
compensation and benefit levels are changed after the date of this proxy statement, actual payments to a named executive
officer may be different than those provided for above. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following

Equity. Reflects the accelerated vesting at the Effective Time of certain Meritor PSU Awards, which is a “single trigger” benefit
provided to all holders of outstanding Company PSU awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and assumed vesting of Meritor
RSU Awards and remaining Meritor PSU awards, which is a “double trigger” benefit provided that becomes vested and payable

estimated by deeming the applicable performance goals achieved at the target level of performance. For further details regarding
the treatment of Meritor equity awards in connection with the Merger, see “Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S.
holders (as defined below) of Common Stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. This
discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. holders.
This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the
“Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions and administrative rulings
and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the “IRS”), each as in effect as of the date
hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any
such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis
of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or
the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith), nor does it address any
considerations under state, local or foreign tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal
income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, the conclusions set forth in this
discussion could be subject to challenge, which challenge could be sustained.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Common Stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
a citizen or resident individual of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s
administration, and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust,
or (ii) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock who hold such shares as a capital asset
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S.
holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under
U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign
currencies, traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the
alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt
organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain former
citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations or other pass-through entities or investors in such
partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment
companies, U.S. holders who hold shares of Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,
conversion or other integrated transaction, a holder required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross
income with respect to shares of Common Stock as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable
financial statement, and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of Common Stock through the exercise of employee
stock options or other compensation arrangements).
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) holds shares of Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend
on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a
partner in a partnership holding shares of Common Stock, you should consult your tax advisor.
This discussion of material U.S. federal tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax
advice. Holders of Common Stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, state, local, foreign income or other tax
laws.
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who
receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in its shares of Common Stock.
Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Common
Stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of
certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Common
Stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period
separately with respect to each block of Common Stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup
withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the
applicable withholding agent a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury
that such U.S. holder is a “United States person” (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification
number provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded by the IRS or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder
furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.
Regulatory Approvals
Antitrust Clearance. Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the
Merger, may not be completed until certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR
Act requires that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the United States Federal Trade Commission (the
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“FTC”). A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar
waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of
that waiting period. In certain circumstances the review period may be extended by either the parties or the Antitrust
Division or FTC. Completion of the Merger is conditioned on the expiration or early termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, and the receipt of certain approvals under the competition laws of certain
specified jurisdictions and the investment laws of certain specified jurisdictions. The Company and Parent filed their
respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on March 7, 2022. The applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act expired on April 6, 2022.
At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division
or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to
rescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions or other
remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the
antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to
enjoin the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may
also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a
challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be
successful.
Commitments to Obtain Antitrust Approval. The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub are each required to, and to
cause their respective affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective
the Transactions, subject to certain limitations, and to cause the conditions to the transactions to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete
the Merger - Antitrust Matters.”
Filing Fees. Parent has agreed to bear the cost of all filing fees payable to any governmental authority in connection
with any filings made to obtain regulatory approval.
Delisting and Deregistration of the Common Stock
If the Merger is completed, the Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange
Act.
Litigation Relating to the Merger
As of April 18, 2022, three lawsuits have been filed by purported Meritor shareholders in connection with the Merger
and one demand letter has been sent. On March 22, 2022, a purported Meritor shareholder filed a lawsuit against
Meritor and the current members of the Meritor Board alleging that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Meritor in
connection with the Merger contained alleged material misstatements and/or omissions in violation of federal law.
The lawsuit is captioned O’Dell v. Meritor, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02322, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York. On March 24, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants
asserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Whitfield v. Meritor, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01636, and is pending in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In addition, on March 31, 2022, another lawsuit was filed
against the same defendants, also asserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Fitzurka v. Meritor, Inc., et al.,
No. 1:22-cv-011793, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Also on March 31,
2022, counsel for Shiva Stein, a purported Meritor shareholder, sent a demand letter including similar allegations
against Meritor and the current members of the Meritor Board.
The complaints and demand letter generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Meritor in connection
with the Merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections
of Meritor, (ii) certain financial analyses of Meritor’s financial advisor, (iii) the financial benefits to Meritor executives
and members of the Meritor Board from the Merger, and (iv) certain statements concerning the sale process. Plaintiffs
generally seek, among other things, to enjoin Meritor from consummating the Merger, or in the alternative, rescission
of the Merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney’s fees.
Meritor believes that the allegations in the complaints and demand letter are without merit. Additional lawsuits and
demand letters arising out of the Merger may also be filed or sent in the future.

At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock (excluding Canceled Shares and Converted Shares) will cease to
be outstanding and automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of certificates or book-entry shares. The Merger Consideration will be paid
without interest and is subject to any required tax withholdings.
At the Effective Time, each of the Canceled Shares will automatically be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration and will cease to exist. In addition, at the Effective Time, each of the Converted Shares will
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the surviving corporation,
such that each such subsidiary’s ownership percentage of the surviving corporation immediately after the Effective

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding Meritor
equity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:
•
each share of Meritor restricted common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, with each holder of such shares receiving the
same Merger Consideration as all other outstanding shareholders of Common Stock at the Effective Time;
•
each Meritor RSU Award will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock subject to such Meritor RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Meritor RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all service-based
vesting conditions; provided that any accelerated vesting applicable to such Meritor RSU Award in the
event of a qualifying termination of employment occurring after the closing date shall apply for the
remaining term of such Converted RSU Award; and
•
each Meritor PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (A) scheduled to
vest on or prior to September 30, 2024 will fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common
Stock subject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable taxes
and (B) scheduled to vest after September 30, 2024 will be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock
subject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Converted PSU Award”),
subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Meritor PSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including all service-based vesting conditions; provided that any accelerated
vesting applicable to such Meritor PSU Award in the event of a qualifying termination of employment
occurring after the closing date shall apply for the remaining term of such Converted PSU Award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Meritor PSU Award
with a performance period that is incomplete (or that is complete but for which performance is not
determinable due to the unavailability of the required data for relative measures) as of the Effective Time
will be determined by deeming the performance goals applicable to such Meritor PSU Award to be achieved
at the target level of performance.
In the case of any Meritor Equity Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, all payments with respect to
such Meritor Equity Award shall be made in accordance with and at the earliest time as is consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and may otherwise be treated in an alternate method to the extent required
by law or agreed by the parties.

economic conditions generally;
•
changes, proposed changes, pending changes or changes in the interpretation of GAAP or any law;

about the person that made it and only if failing to do so would be inconsistent with the Meritor Board’s
fiduciary duties, and to refer the inquiring person to the non-solicitation or negotiation provisions of the

each person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a Company

equity securities of Meritor;
•
any tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of persons
beneficially owning more than 15% (on a non-diluted basis) of any class of outstanding voting or equity
securities of Meritor;
•
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization or other

business constituting more than 15% of the net revenues or net income of the Company and its

subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value).
A “Company Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written Company Takeover Proposal which the Meritor Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, after taking into
account (i) the timing and likelihood that such Company Takeover Proposal will be consummated (including whether
such Company Takeover Proposal is contingent on receipt of third party financing), (ii) all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal and (iii) the persons making such Company Takeover

“85%” in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal will be replaced with references to “50%” respectively.
Change in the Meritor Board Recommendation
The Meritor Board has unanimously recommended that Meritor shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
Generally, the Meritor Board may not:
•
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or resolve to or publicly propose or announce

business day prior to the special meeting); provided that Parent may not make a request on more than one
occasion for each Company Takeover Proposal; or
•
fail to recommend on Schedule 14D-9 against any Company Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or
exchange subject to Regulation 14D within 10 business days after the commencement of such tender offer
or exchange.
Each of the actions described in the bullet points above, a “Change of Recommendation.”
Prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Meritor Board may, in response to an unsolicited
Company Takeover Proposal received by the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result
from a breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations, effect a Change of Recommendation or cause the
Company to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement providing for such
Company Superior Proposal, subject to the requirements that:
•
the Meritor Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, but only if the
Meritor Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
•
the Company provides prior written notice to Parent, at least four business days in advance, that it intends
to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Company
Superior Proposal, which notice specifies the identity of the person making such proposal and a summary
of the material terms thereof and includes a copy of the proposed Company Superior Proposal and the
proposed acquisition agreement with respect thereto;
•
during the four business day period following the date on which notice was received (or with an additional
two business day extension, in the event of any change to (i) the financial terms or (ii) other material terms
of such Company Superior Proposal), the Company and its representatives negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as Parent may
propose; and
•
upon the conclusion of the applicable notice and negotiation period, the Meritor Board consider in good
faith any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and determine,
after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the Company
Takeover Proposal continues to continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that a failure to
take the contemplated actions would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.
The Meritor Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation (prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval) in response to an Intervening Event if the Meritor Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the requirements that:
•
the Company provides prior written notice to Parent, at least four business days in advance, that it intends
to effect a Change of Recommendation specifying the reasons therefore and including a description of the
Intervening Event;
•
during the four business day period following the date on which notice was received, the Company and its
representatives negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement as Parent may propose; and
•
upon the conclusion of the applicable negotiation period, the Meritor Board after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent, determine in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure of the Meritor Board to
make such a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub are each required to, and to cause their respective affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions and to cause the conditions to

under the HSR Act or other applicable competition and investment laws) required to be obtained or made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the transactions or the taking of
any action contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iv) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.
The Company and Parent shall (i) keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any governmental authority reviewing the Transactions, (ii) promptly consult

request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other (or their counsel) with copies of) all
notices, submissions or filings (other than any Notification and Report Form submitted under the HSR Act) made by
or on behalf of such party or any of its affiliates with any governmental authority or any other information supplied
by or on behalf of such party to, or correspondence with, any person in connection with the Merger Agreement or

oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any communication from or to any governmental authority
regarding the Transactions, and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
timely views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such
governmental authority and (iv) to the extent permitted by applicable law, ensure the other party is given the
opportunity to attend any meetings, teleconferences or videoconferences with or other appearances before any
governmental authority with respect to the Merger Agreement or the Transactions, and prior to any such meeting,
teleconference, or videoconference, reasonably consult with the other with respect thereto. Parent must reasonably
consult with the Company as to the strategy relating to the seeking of approvals under any applicable competition
law or investment law, but Parent has the sole right to determine and control such strategy, including for the final
content of any substantive communications with any applicable governmental authority with respect to any
investigation under any competition law or investment law. Materials required to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation or future plans of Parent or the Company
and the Transactions, as necessary to comply with existing contractual obligations, and as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns, provided that a party redacting materials must use its reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure of such information not in violation of any
applicable law, existing contractual obligation, or privilege. In addition, any party may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate competitively sensitive materials as “outside counsel only material.”
Antitrust Matters. The Company and Parent have agreed to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than 10 business days) after the date of the Merger Agreement and to (ii) make
or file, as promptly as practicable, with the appropriate governmental authority, all other filings, registrations and
notifications required to be filed to consummate the Merger under specified competition laws and investment laws.
Neither the Company nor Parent will withdraw any such filings or applications, nor extend the timing for any review
period by any governmental authority in connection with obtaining transaction approvals, without the prior written
consent of the other party. Parent’s reasonable best efforts under the efforts provision of the Merger Agreement
include (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order,
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of and restriction on the
businesses, assets, properties, product lines, and equity interest of, or changes to the conduct of business of, the
Company, Parent, and their respective affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its affiliates) (y) creating,
terminating, or divesting relationships,

ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective affiliates, and (z) taking or
committing to take any action that would limit Parent’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the
Company (including any of their respective affiliates) (each, a “Regulatory Remedy”), in each case, if such
Regulatory Remedy should be reasonably necessary, proper, or advisable, so as to permit the consummation of the
Merger to occur under applicable competition or investment laws no later than the Termination Date, as extended, if
applicable. The Company, however, will not propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions without the prior
written consent of Parent. The “reasonable best efforts” standard will not require, nor be construed to require, Parent
to waive any of the closing conditions as they apply to Parent, or Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to
propose, negotiate, commit to, effect, agree to, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition. In addition, Parent agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.
“Burdensome Condition” means any Regulatory Remedy that, individually or in the aggregate with any other
Regulatory Remedy, would reasonably be expected to (i) substantially and materially impair the benefits expected by
Parent, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, to be realized from the consummation of the Merger or (ii) have more
than an immaterial impact on Parent or any of its subsidiaries (other than, following the Effective Time, Meritor or any
of its subsidiaries) or any of the assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in existence as of the date of the Merger Agreement (other than, following the Effective Time, Meritor or
any of its subsidiaries).

From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the surviving corporation to, to the full extent permitted under
applicable law and consistent with the rights and obligations set forth in the Company’s articles of incorporation and
bylaws, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former (or future, but prior to the Effective Time), director,
officer employee or agent of Meritor or any of its subsidiaries and any person who is, presently or formerly (or will be
prior to the Effective Time), serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, agent, partner, trustee or in another authorized capacity of or for another corporation, unincorporated
association, business trust, estate, partnership, joint venture, individual trust, employee benefit plan or other legal
entity, whether or not organized or formed for profit (collectively, the “Covered Persons”) in connection with any

judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement relating to or resulting from such D&O Claim and (ii)
promptly advance claim expenses as incurred by the Covered Persons in connection with any D&O Claim, provided
that any Covered Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay the advance if it is
ultimately determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification from the surviving corporation.
In addition, prior to the Effective Time, Meritor will obtain, and prepay the premium for, a six year “tail” insurance
policy for D&O Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time.
Any such tail policy must have at least the same coverage and amounts and contain terms and conditions that are no
less favorable to the covered individuals as the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’
insurance policy with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
will such tail policy have a total premium amount greater than 275% of the annual premium most recently paid by the
Company for its existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy as of the date of the Merger Agreement (such
amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If such tail policy is not reasonably available or the premium of such tail
policy exceeds the Maximum Annual Premium, the Company will obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage
available for a total premium not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company fails to obtain such tail
policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the surviving corporation will obtain such a tail policy.",65,65

In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination,” the Merger Agreement will become void and have
no further force or effect, with no liability to any person on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their
respective subsidiaries, except that no such termination will relieve (i) Meritor of any liability to pay the Company
Termination Fee or Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement or (ii)
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company of any liability for damages arising out of fraud or willful breach; provided that
the payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, and, if applicable,
termination expenses and interest, will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent against the Company or the
Company against Parent, as applicable. In addition, certain sections of the Merger Agreement, including, among
others, sections relating to the confidentiality obligations of Meritor, Parent and Merger Sub, expenses and public
announcements will survive termination.

The parties agreed that the Merger Agreement will be governed by Delaware law, without giving effect to any conflict
of law provision, rule or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction), except to the extent
the provisions of the IBCL are mandatorily applicable to the Merger. Each party agreed to irrevocably and
unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or if such court
finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division)
for purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of the Merger Agreement or the Transactions,
provided that if subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or other proceeding is vested exclusively in the U.S.
federal courts, such suit, action or other proceeding will be heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware. Each party further irrevocably and unconditionally waived any right such party may have to a trial by jury
with respect to any action, suit or proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement
or the Transactions.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the parties
do not perform or otherwise breach the provisions of the Merger Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of them in order to consummate the Merger and effect the closing) in accordance with its specified terms.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub have acknowledged and agreed that: (i) they are entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee will be constructed to
diminish or impair any party’s right to specific enforcement; and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement and without that right neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into the Merger Agreement. Any party seeking an order or injunction to prevent and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Meritor is providing
its shareholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal, as described in
the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Transaction,” including the footnotes to the table and related narrative discussion.
The Meritor Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Meritor approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Meritor’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be
paid or become payable, in each case, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of Meritor’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor’s Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Transaction,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby
APPROVED.”
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and
vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Meritor
or Parent. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation may be
payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and
arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Meritor shareholders.
The above resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of Meritor’s named executive officers on an
advisory (non-binding) basis requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present
virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that vote thereon.
The Meritor Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Meritor vote “FOR” the Compensation
Proposal.

The Company’s shareholders are being asked to approve the Adjournment Proposal. If the Adjournment Proposal is
approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by the Meritor Board to any date (subject to certain limitations in
the Merger Agreement). Meritor may not postpone or adjourn the special meeting without Parent’s prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if Meritor
reasonably determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that the Company Shareholder
Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the special meeting, including due to an absence of quorum, the Company may
adjourn or postpone the special meeting, for a period no longer than 30 calendar days, to solicit additional proxies in
favor of the Merger Proposal or (ii) if Parent reasonably determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside
legal counsel, that the Company Shareholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the special meeting, Parent may
request that Meritor adjourn, delay or postpone the special meeting. If the special meeting is adjourned for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke
them at any time before their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any
proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but
do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in favor of the
Adjournment Proposal.
The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved by the requisite
number of shares of Common Stock at the special meeting.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on Merger Proposal. Accordingly,
you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Adjournment Proposal and vice versa.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
present virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that vote thereon.
The Meritor Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Meritor vote “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal, if a vote on the Adjournment Proposal is called.

The following table sets forth certain information, as of April 11, 2022, regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of
Common Stock with respect to:
•
each person that is a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock;
•
each director;
•
each named executive officer; and
•
all directors and executive officers as a group.
The amounts and percentages of Common Stock beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the
SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is
deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power
to vote or direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct
the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person
has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Securities that can be so acquired are deemed to be
outstanding for purposes of computing such person’s ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any
other person’s percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same
securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no
economic interest. Except as otherwise indicated, each of the beneficial owners has, to our knowledge, sole voting
and investment power with respect to the indicated shares of common stock. In addition, except as otherwise
indicated, the address of each of the directors and executive officers of the Company is c/o Meritor, Inc., 2135 West
Maple Road, Troy, Michigan 48084-7186. The below beneficial ownership information includes shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of options within 60 days of April 11, 2022.

without any action on the part of any party or holder of any shares of Common Stock or Company Equity Awards or

(a) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and all such shares shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Treatment of Common Stock.
(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Canceled Shares and Converted Shares) and all rights in respect thereof, shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash, without interest (the “Merger

shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so as to maintain relative ownership percentages.
(c) Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Converted RSU
Award”), subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all service-based vesting conditions; provided that any
accelerated vesting applicable to such Company RSU Award in the event of a Qualifying Termination (as
such term is defined in the Company Equity Plans) occurring after the Closing Date shall apply for the
remaining term of such Converted RSU Award.
(iii) At the Effective Time, each Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (A) scheduled to vest on or prior to September 30, 2024 shall fully vest and be canceled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger

but for which performance is not determinable due to the unavailability of the required data for relative
measures) as of the Effective Time shall be determined by deeming the performance goals applicable to
such Company PSU Award to be achieved at the target level of performance.
(iv) Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation to settle the Merger Consideration
described in Section 3.1(c)(i), Section 3.1(c)(ii) and Section 3.1(c)(iii) to holders of Company Equity Awards
through the payroll system or payroll provider of the Surviving Corporation (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholding) at the time set forth in the applicable award agreement, solely to the extent such
awards become vested in accordance with the terms thereof (as modified pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii) or
3.1(c)(iii) above). If any payment of the Merger Consideration cannot be made through the Company’s or
the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a
check for such payment to such holder (less applicable withholding Taxes), which check will be sent by
overnight courier to such holder as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

of the Code, all payments with respect to such Company Equity Award shall be made in accordance with
and at the earliest time as is consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and nothing
herein is intended, or shall be construed, to change the payment timing with respect to any such Company
Equity Award in violation of Section 409A of the Code.

Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or

(a) Paying Agent; Paying Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company of national recognition and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) to act as
agent for the holders of shares of Common Stock to receive the funds to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Company relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities under this Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Common Stock cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration to which holders of such shares shall
become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) (excluding payments with respect to Canceled Shares and Converted
Shares) (such aggregate cash, the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose, subject to Section 3.3(h).
(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later
than three (3) Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a Certificate whose shares of
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(b) (A)
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
A-13TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall
be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
(ii) Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates, upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, and each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Book-Entry Shares (which shall be deemed surrendered upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s
message” in customary form or such other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1(b), and the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred,
and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the transfer or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
III.
(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been
declared or made by the Company on the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs,
the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as
provided in this Article III.
(d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not exchanged shares of Common
Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration shall (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger
Consideration without any interest.
(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any distributions from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.
(f) Lost Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if
required by Parent, the posting by the Person of a bond, in such customary amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section 3.3(d), the Surviving Corporation)
will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and the making of
a customary indemnity, the payments with respect to such Certificate to which such Person is entitled pursuant
to this Article III.
(g) Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Paying Agent,
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.
(h) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund, as
directed by Parent; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article III, and following any losses from any such
investment, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any interest or other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ respective other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry,

or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (ii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
information for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or

unsolicited bona fide inquiry that did not arise from a material breach of this Section 6.4(a), solely for the
purpose of obtaining clarification from the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal of the terms of
such Company Takeover Proposal and facts about the Person that made it and only if failing to do so would be
inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties, and to refer the inquiring Person to this Section 6.4).

consent, any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement (if
any) to which the Company is a party, in each case, that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made

with the Transactions shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.4(a) by the Company.
(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(a), if at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company receives an unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal that is not withdrawn from any Person that did not result from a breach of Section 6.4(a), and if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
(x) that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal, and (y) failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) below would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, in response to

which shall promptly be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to Parent following the execution and
delivery thereof), information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person that has made such
written Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives, prospective debt and equity financing sources
and/or their respective Representatives (provided that the Company shall, prior to or substantially concurrently
with the delivery to such Person, provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such Person or its Representatives, prospective debt and
equity financing sources and/or their respective Representatives unless such information has been previously
provided to Parent) and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives, prospective debt and equity financing
sources and/or their respective Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal; provided that the
Company and its Representatives may contact any Person in writing (with a request that any response from
such Person is in writing) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal solely to clarify any ambiguous terms
and conditions thereof which are necessary to determine whether the Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal (without the Company Board being required to make the determination in the
foregoing clauses (x) and (y)). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) notify
Parent in writing if the Company Board makes the determinations set forth in this Section 6.4(b).
(c) Notice. From the date hereof and until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than thirty-six (36) hours
after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal, any proposals, offers or inquiries that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, any inquiry or request for nonpublic

material terms of any of the foregoing. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the person making the Company
Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer, inquiry or request, and the material terms and conditions of any such
proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, including
unredacted copies of all written requests, proposals, correspondence or offers and proposed agreements
received by the Company or its Representatives relating to such Company Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer,
inquiry or request or, if such Company Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer, inquiry or request is not in writing, a
reasonably detailed written description of the material terms and conditions thereof. Unless this Agreement has
been or is substantially concurrently being terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not take any
action to exempt any Person other than Parent or Merger Sub from the restrictions on “business combinations”
contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or otherwise cause
such restrictions not to apply to a transaction (other than the Transactions). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person which directly or indirectly prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this
Section 6.4.

Company Takeover Proposal or more than one occasion in respect of any material modification of a Company
Takeover Proposal, or (D) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
against any Company Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D
promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a “Change of Recommendation”), or (ii) cause or direct the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, expense reimbursement agreement, joint venture
agreement or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with Section 6.4(b)) (a “Company Acquisition Agreement”). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company Board may, in response to an unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal received by the Company after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section 6.4(a), (x) make a Change of
Recommendation, or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(d)(ii)
and substantially concurrently take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions of any Takeover Laws
(including under Section 23-1-43 of the IBCL), if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal, but only if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that prior to taking any of the actions contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (x) or (y), (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, including a summary of the material terms and conditions of,
and the identity of the person making any such Company Superior Proposal and contemporaneously provide to
Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreement,
(B) during such four (4)-Business Day period following the date on which such notice is received (which shall
expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the final Business Day of such period), the Company shall and shall cause
its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as Parent may propose, (C) upon the end of such notice period (or such subsequent notice
period as contemplated by clause (D)), the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that a failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section
6.4(d) would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (D) in the event of
any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice
period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (provided that the notice period thereunder shall cause
any remaining notice period to be extended by two (2) Business Days) during which time the Company shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.4(d) anew with respect to such additional notice,
including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board shall
not be entitled to effect such a Change of Recommendation until (i) the Company shall have given Parent at
least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to effect such a Change of Recommendation

expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the final Business Day of such period), the Company shall and shall cause
its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent, to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and (iii) following the end of such four (4)-Business Day period, the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and taking into account any revisions to the

Section 6.4(f) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Change of Recommendation other
than in accordance with Section 6.4(d) or Section 6.4(e). Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to

The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the
SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the

Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. Parent and Merger Sub
shall exercise reasonable best efforts to furnish all information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other

furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR Act or other applicable Competition
Laws and Investment Laws) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by

the other parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the
other parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other

to, or correspondence with, any Person in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to
this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other
parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any
communication from or to any Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions, and permit the other parties
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the timely views of the other parties in connection
with, any proposed communication or submission with any such Governmental Authority. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties shall ensure that the other party is given the opportunity to
attend any meetings, teleconferences or videoconferences with or other appearances before any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and prior to any such meeting, teleconference or
videoconference, the parties shall reasonably consult with each other with respect thereto. Parent shall
reasonably consult with the Company as to the strategy relating to the seeking of approvals under any
applicable Competition Law or Investment Law, but Parent shall have the sole right to determine and control
over such strategy, including for the final content of any substantive communications with any applicable
Governmental Authority with respect to any investigation under any Competition Law or Investment Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.6 a s
“Outside Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 6.6, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation or future plans of Parent or the Company and the Transactions, (ii) as
necessary to comply with existing contractual obligations and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns, provided, that a party redacting materials shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure of such information not in violation of any applicable
Law, existing contractual obligation, or privilege.
(c) The Company and Parent shall make or file, as promptly as practicable, with the appropriate Governmental
Authority all filings, forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the Merger under
the Competition Laws and Investment Laws of the jurisdictions set forth on Section 4.3(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding those jurisdictions indicated as being post-Closing
items) and subsequent to such filings, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, as promptly as practicable, respond to inquiries from Governmental Authorities, or provide any supplemental
information that may be requested by Governmental Authorities, in connection with filings made with such
Governmental Authorities. Each of the Company and Parent shall, in cooperation and consultation with the
other, make its respective filing under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, and make any filings, notifications or submissions required by the Competition Laws and
Investment Laws of the jurisdictions set forth on Section 4.3(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter (for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding those jurisdictions indicated as being post-Closing items) as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than as required by applicable Law. Neither the
Company nor Parent will withdraw any such filings or applications, nor extend the timing for any review period
by any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining Transaction Approvals, without the prior written
consent of the other party.
(d) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.6, but on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement (including Section 6.6(e)), Parent’s reasonable best efforts pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall
include (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of and restriction on
the businesses, assets, properties, product lines, and equity interests of, or changes to the conduct of business
of, the Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates),
(ii) creating, terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company
or Parent or their respective Affiliates, and (iii) taking or committing to take any action that would limit Parent’s
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets,
equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Company (including any of their respective
Affiliates) (each a “Regulatory Remedy”), in each case, if such Regulatory Remedy should be
A-43

reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, so as to permit the consummation of the Merger to occur under
applicable Competition Laws or Investment Laws no later than the Termination Date. Nothing in this Section
6.6(d) shall require Parent to effectuate or agree to effectuate any Regulatory Remedy unless such Regulatory
Remedy is conditioned on the Closing and only effective after the Closing. In no event will the Company (and
the Company will cause its Affiliates not to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any of the actions described
in the foregoing sentence without the prior written consent of Parent.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither this Section 6.6 nor the “reasonable
best efforts” standard herein require, or shall be construed to require, (i) Parent to waive any of the conditions
set forth in Article VII as they apply to Parent, or (ii) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to propose,
negotiate, commit to, effect, agree to or otherwise take or commit to take any action that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition.
(f) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions as in violation of any Competition Law or
Investment Law, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts (subject to the limitations set forth herein) to contest
and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made under this Section 6.6.

(a) For the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing Date (or, if shorter, the period of employment
of the relevant Continuing Employee), Parent shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing, to the extent that each such employee remains
employed with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) as of and following the
Closing (any such employee, a “Continuing Employee”) with: (i) at least the same annual base salary or base
wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) at least the same level of cash-based short-term
incentive target opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company in respect of the fiscal
year in which the Closing Date occurs, (iii) at least the same level of equity-based long-term incentive target
opportunity provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent (provided that if an annual equity or
equity-based award is issued to a Continuing Employee following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date
in accordance with Section 6.2(b)(x) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent shall not be required to provide a
long-term incentive opportunity to such Continuing Employee during the one (1)-year period immediately
following the Closing Date), and (iv) as applied to Continuing Employees in the aggregate, other employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (A) such employee benefits provided under
the Company Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing
Date, or (B) the employee benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent, in each case
excluding plans that were closed to new enrollees as of Closing. Without limiting the immediately preceding
sentence, Parent shall provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, for the one (1)-year period immediately
following the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee with severance benefits equal to the severance benefits
provided for under the Company Benefit Plan that is a severance benefit plan set forth in Section 4.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.
(b) Periods of employment of Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its current or former
Affiliates, to the same extent and for the same purposes as recognized under any comparable Company Benefit
Plan of the Company and its Affiliates, including their predecessor entities, shall be taken into account for
purposes of (i) eligibility for participation, (ii) vesting, and (iii) determining level of benefits of the corresponding
employee benefit plan (excluding any plan providing for defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred
compensation, equity or equity-based compensation, or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits)
offered by Parent or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent to the Continuing Employees during the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs; provided, however, that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to
recognize such service to the extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits or compensation.
Additionally, during the applicable plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall, or cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive any pre-existing condition
A-44TABLE OF CONTENTS
limitations under the applicable U.S. group health care plans of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent to the extent
such condition was satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date
and (B) credit all Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with all payments credited against out-of-
pocket maximums and deductible payments and co-payments paid by such Person, in each case, under the
Company Benefit Plan providing health insurance during the portion of the plan year prior to the Closing Date
for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such Person has satisfied his or her deductible and
whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any U.S. health insurance plans of Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent for such plan year.
(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans (other than
Company Equity Plans) set forth on Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their
terms, subject to Parent’s ability to amend and terminate such Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms.
(d) Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall (i) be treated as the establishment of, an amendment of, or undertaking to
establish or amend, any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from establishing, amending, modifying or
terminating any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement or from terminating or modifying the employment or engagement of any Continuing Employee or
other service provider. The provisions of this Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.7, express or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee,
or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including third-party
beneficiary right or any right to employment or continued employment (or any particular term or condition of
employment) for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement or a right of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person under any other
compensation or employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement that such employee or
beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the terms of any such benefit plan without regard
to this Agreement.

each of the Company and Parent may make any public statements in response to questions by the press, analysts,
investors or analysts or those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as such statements
consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this Section 6.8; provided, further, that the Company may

Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in
respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such D&O Claim (without prejudice to Section 6.11), and (ii)
promptly advance to such Covered Person any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any D&O Claim in advance of the final disposition of such
D&O Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Covered Person of any Claim Expenses
incurred by such Covered Person in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Person to whom such Claim
Expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification from the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such D&O
Claim, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by the Covered
Person in the defense of any such D&O Claim. All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Person’s heirs, successors,
executors and personal and legal representatives.
(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, limitations on
liability of Covered Persons, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons than are set
forth as of the date hereof in the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if any D&O Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against such
Covered Persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.9(b) shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such D&O Claim.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six (6)-
year prepaid “tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger) of at least the
same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered
individuals as the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or policies
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time for D&O Claims arising from facts, acts, events or
omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall such
tail policy have a total premium amount greater than two hundred seventy-five percent (275%) of the annual
premium most recently paid by the Company for its existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or policies
as of the date hereof (such amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). The Company represents and warrants
that, as of the date hereof, the annual premium paid by the Company for such existing directors’ and officers’
insurance policy or policies is set forth in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If such tail policy is
not reasonably available or the premium of such tail policy exceeds the Maximum Annual Premium, the Company
shall obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a total premium not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium. If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain such a tail policy. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any such
policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all its obligations
thereunder.
(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) sells all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.
(e) The obligations under this Section 6.9 shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in
any manner that is adverse to any Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns), it being
expressly agreed that each Covered Person (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be a third-
party beneficiary of this Section 6.9. In the event of a final judgement or adjudication of a breach by the

Surviving Corporation or Parent of this Section 6.9, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 6.9 as such fees are incurred, upon the written request of such Covered
Person.

such termination, (A) one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(c), Section 7.1(d)
or Section 7.2(d) (with respect to Section 7.1(a) and Section 7.2(d), only as the result of an Order or
injunction issued or granted in respect of the Transactions by a Governmental Authority pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law or any applicable Investment Law) have not been
satisfied or waived, (B) the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) has been satisfied, (C) all of the other
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (if such conditions would be satisfied or
validly waived were the Closing to occur at such time)) and (D) no breach by the Company of its
obligations under Section 6.2 or Section 6.6 has been the principal cause of the failure to be satisfied of all
or any of the conditions listed in clause (A) of this Section 8.3(c)(i), then Parent shall pay the Parent
Termination Fee to the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days following such termination) by wire transfer of immediately available funds; or
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(iii), in each case only as the result of an Order or injunction issued or granted in
respect of the Transactions by a Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Competition Law or any applicable Investment Law and, at the time of such termination, no breach by the
Company of its obligations under Section 6.2 or Section 6.6 has been the principal cause of the imposition
of such Order or injunction, then Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.
(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fees are not intended to be a penalty but
rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party entitled to receive such
Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is paid, for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and
on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision.
(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party hereto fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.3, and the other party commences a suit that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against the
failing party for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3 or a portion thereof, the failing party shall pay to the
other party all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including
reasonable and documented attorney’s fees as well as expenses incurred in connection with any such action),
together with interest on such amount or such portion thereof at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made (together, the “Termination Expenses
and Interest”).
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the provisos in Section 8.3(a)
and Section 9.6, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent or the Company has the
right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant
to this Section 8.3, the payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable,
and, if applicable, the Termination Expenses and Interest, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
against the Company or the Company against Parent, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, and upon
payment of such amounts, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall have no further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement (except that the Company remains obligated to pay to Parent and
Merger Sub and Parent remains obligated to pay to the Company, as applicable, any amount due and payable
pursuant to Section 8.3(f)), whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
